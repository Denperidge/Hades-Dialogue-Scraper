OrpheusFirstMeeting|Orpheus First Meeting|Zagreus|Orpheus, you're back! Look, don't get on Father's bad side like that and you're going to be fine. Besides... right now I think he's angrier with me.
OrpheusFirstMeeting|Orpheus First Meeting|Orpheus|I grieve for you, my friend. But if you've come to ask me for a song, why, I'm afraid I must stand firm about my answer.

OrpheusMiscMeeting01|Orpheus Misc Meeting 01|Orpheus|Oh, hello Zagreus. I was just wondering if you had ever heard of any other court musicians who had lost the will to sing? Your father's asked me to explain myself and honestly it has been rather difficult.
OrpheusMiscMeeting01|Orpheus Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|If it's any consolation, mate, I'm certain every single undead court musician serving in the throne room of the god of the dead has been through everything you're going through.

OrpheusMiscMeeting02|Orpheus Misc Meeting 02|Orpheus|It's awfully quiet here, you know, when you're out and about? Makes me a bit self-conscious, truth be told, seeing as ostensibly I'm the musician of this court.
OrpheusMiscMeeting02|Orpheus Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|Look, if you decide to start strumming on that lyre again, I'm sure nobody here is going to mind. Though you take care, OK?

OrpheusMiscMeeting03|Orpheus Misc Meeting 03|Orpheus|Oh, hello Zagreus. You look a little down. And so I was just wondering, would you perchance fancy a song right now?
Text|Text|Zagreus|Hey, now, there's no need to do anything rash like that! That Ambrosia was my gift to you, and it was unconditional. Just try the stuff and see! They say the purer the act of giving, the better it is. Won't you keep it? If not for yourself, then for the lounge?
Text|Text|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}, all right, I... had to ask, so, thanks again. Just wanted to make sure! I hope we can enjoy it at the lounge sometime!! I'd better go put it away. Not drink it! Store it for safe keeping, now, OK?
Text|Text|Zagreus|How about {#DialogueItalicFormat}In the Blood{#PreviousFormat}? That's one of your old hits, right?
Text|Text|Orpheus|Oh, fancy that one do you? Alas, I've not the heart to sing it anymore. I'm glad you like it, though.
Text|Text|Zagreus|How about {#DialogueItalicFormat}Argonauts{#PreviousFormat}, didn't you sail with them?

OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|Orpheus, forgive my bluntness here, but I have to ask. Why won't you sing? You were a legend, mate! Our court musician!
OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Orpheus|Why, it's that I have lost my muse, my friend. It isn't harder to explain than that. Have you not had such moments in your life, where you had lost the will to chase your passions?
OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|I, I suppose I have, yeah. But recently I found my drive again, and that's why I have to get out of here.
OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Orpheus|And I am truly happy for you, friend. Alas, I've had no luck in my own search, not that I'm searching any longer, so, I'll just be over here, OK?

OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Orpheus|I fear my muse is long since lost to me, my friend, though truly thanks for asking. I suppose she must be out there somewhere still, since I once traveled 'cross this land in search of her, and found her then. But that was quite a while back.
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|Wait, you found her? What happened?
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Orpheus|Well, this was back when I was still alive, you understand. Your father, why, he doesn't care for anyone to leave this realm, and, basically now I'm stuck here as well! Not seen her since, and, I'm not much for travel anymore.
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|That's... I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for letting me know. I hope you get to see her again someday.
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Orpheus|I appreciate the sentiment, my friend, though please don't worry about her or me. I mean, we're dead! We're fine.

OrpheusAboutMusicStand01|Orpheus About Music Stand 01|Zagreus|Our renowned court musician ought to have the finest means available, I think. I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus. Though, tell me something, how can it play your music when you're not even here?

OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|So, I am quite confused, I must admit, my friend. The Queen Persephone, she is your mother, then? How is it that she came to reside, here?
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Well, {#DialogueItalicFormat}erm{#PreviousFormat}... it all started when my father saw her on Olympus, and... they fell madly in love. He swept her off her feet, and brought her here. The Olympians, they got pretty worried when they saw she was gone. But now it's OK! Everything's out in the open.
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|But, surely the Queen's mother on Olympus, the great goddess Demeter... surely she would quite like it if she saw her daughter still, from time to time?
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Oh, that! Thing is, Mother ate some... pomegranate seeds when she was here. And we have rules about that stuff, you know! It means she cannot leave this place for very long at all. I'm sure Demeter will understand. And unfreeze everything when her daughter's around.
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|Ah, yes, pomegranate seeds, of course, of course! Though, there is one more subject I don't understand, which is... how {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}fit into all of this. Were you not trying to escape from here?
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Forget about me, Orpheus! This isn't about me, it's about Mother. What's important is she's here, where she belongs.
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|I see! I understand. Well, thank you, then, for clearing all that up. It is a splendid tale, I must say, and every part of it makes sense to me, at last.

OrpheusTallTale02|Orpheus Tall Tale 02|Orpheus|Why, that is a spectacularly vivid tale, Zagreus, and most deserving to be chronicled in song! Would that there were a poet here still willing to commit such deeds to verse.

OrpheusTallTale03|Orpheus Tall Tale 03|Orpheus|But that is such a splendid tale, Zagreus, deserving to be sung both far and wide, until it turns into the stuff of myth, as deathless as the gods themselves! I'll gladly tell that one about!

OrpheusTallTale04|Orpheus Tall Tale 04|Orpheus|But, Zagreus, that is a striking revelation, the connection you describe. I see it! I can see it now! To think the god of wine and you are intricately linked, it isn't obvious, is it?
OrpheusTallTale04|Orpheus Tall Tale 04|Zagreus|Oh, there's more to it! A bit grim, really, as I'm a little older than I look.

OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Orpheus|Don't I want to see my Eurydice again...? Why, yes. That, more than anything, my friend. Provided she wanted to see me. I tried once to disturb her everlasting rest, as you well know. And that did not pan out as I had hoped....
OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Orpheus|Pray tell me something, Zagreus. How is she lately, hm? Eurydice, I mean. Her hair, fall colors, or full bloom? Her poise, as proud and supple as the oak?
OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Zagreus|She's all right, Orpheus. Seems comfortable within her little place in Asphodel. The only thing that seems to bother her at all is... when I mention you. Is there nothing you can do to patch things up?

OrpheusAboutEurydice04|Orpheus About Eurydice 04|Orpheus|How very understandable, indeed. Were I to have been failed to be rescued from the depths of hell, mere moments from escape, I too would be quite cross with my attempted rescuer. And for quite some time.

OrpheusAboutDistantMemory01|Orpheus About Distant Memory 01|Orpheus|No, Zagreus. Unless of course you wanted to set loose a cherished living memory of mine, and take from me that fleeting bit of joy?

OrpheusWithHades01|Orpheus With Hades 01|Orpheus|Oh, that. I must apologize, again, Lord Hades sir. For I'm afraid that I've no wish to sing as yet. In spite of your persuasiveness even. And, that, um, is my final word upon the subject. At this time.

OrpheusChat22|Orpheus Chat 22|Orpheus|Let's talk when I'm not singing, Zagreus?
OrpheusChat23|Orpheus Chat 23|Orpheus|Hello, my friend, let's get back to my song?
OrpheusChat24|Orpheus Chat 24|Orpheus|I'm kind of singing at the moment, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat25|Orpheus Chat 25|Orpheus|Terribly sorry I can't speak with you right now.
OrpheusChat26|Orpheus Chat 26|Orpheus|I thought I'd lost even the gift of music, Zagreus. So, thanks again for helping find that one for me!
OrpheusChat27|Orpheus Chat 27|Orpheus|I must say, it's nice having some music in my life again, and hopefully in yours!
OrpheusChat28|Orpheus Chat 28|Orpheus|We all could use a little song from time to time, isn't that so?
OrpheusChat29|Orpheus Chat 29|Orpheus|It's nice that I no longer have to live and breathe, and can be focused purely on my song...!
