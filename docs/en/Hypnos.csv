HypnosFirstMeeting|Hypnos First Meeting|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, where... wait, I know {#DialogueItalicFormat}you{#PreviousFormat}! Guess that means you died out there, huh? Well don't be sad, though, pretty much everybody dies sometime!
HypnosMiscMeeting01|Hypnos Misc Meeting 01|Hypnos|Oh! Hi. I'd ask you how it went, but since you're here again, I guess I know already, huh! Oh well, just come on in!
HypnosMiscMeeting02|Hypnos Misc Meeting 02|Hypnos|Ah, good, you're back already, huh? A few of us, we had a bet, about how long you'd last out there, and I just {#DialogueItalicFormat}knew {#PreviousFormat}you'd be back in {#DialogueItalicFormat}no time{#PreviousFormat}!
HypnosMiscMeeting03|Hypnos Misc Meeting 03|Hypnos|Oh, hi! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Um{#PreviousFormat}, welcome home! Again! Go right ahead! I think your dad's mad about something or other, though.
HypnosMiscMeeting04|Hypnos Misc Meeting 04|Hypnos|Wow, you've died at least {#DialogueItalicFormat}five times {#PreviousFormat}so far, I think? Dying's good for the whole ecosystem down here, so, uh, thanks! You're helping make the Underworld a better place!
HypnosMiscMeeting04|Hypnos Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|Great! Just keep dying over and over and everything will be fine.
HypnosMiscMeeting05|Hypnos Misc Meeting 05|Hypnos|It's fun watching the Pool of Styx, you know? The ripples in the blood, and everything, and sometimes, somebody pops out of there, like you! House staff and guests of honor, no one else. I sign them in, and help make sure they have a pleasant stay!
HypnosMiscMeeting06|Hypnos Misc Meeting 06|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ooh{#PreviousFormat}, why you made it all the way to Asphodel that time, that's pretty neat! Still died and everything but not as quickly as you used to, so, that's progress, right?
HypnosRunProgress01_A|Hypnos Run Progress 01 A|Hypnos|Hey, wow, you did it! According to my list it says here you've died, what, fifty times {#DialogueItalicFormat}at least{#PreviousFormat}! That's more than anybody's died around here, I think!
HypnosRunProgress01|Hypnos Run Progress 01|Hypnos|Hey, let me be the first to say: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Congratulations{#PreviousFormat}! You have died a hundred times since I've been keeping score. Since I've been keeping track. No prize for it or anything, but the journey is its own reward, or something, right?
HypnosRunProgress02|Hypnos Run Progress 02|Hypnos|You're not going to believe this, here, you ready? Three.. hundred... {#DialogueItalicFormat}times{#PreviousFormat}!! That's right! Three hundred times, you've died! That's like... more than an entire village from an earthquake, all on your own!
HypnosRunProgress03|Hypnos Run Progress 03|Hypnos|Oh, I just can't believe it, although I know my list here never lies! And it says that you have died all of five {#DialogueItalicFormat}hundred {#PreviousFormat}times! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Five hundred{#PreviousFormat}!! I can't even think of a number higher than that!
HypnosMegDefeated01|Hypnos Meg Defeated 01|Hypnos|It's usually pretty quiet, keeping watch over the Pool of Styx back there. But it's sure been busy lately! Why, somebody else came through just earlier! You should have seen the look on my face when it wasn't you!
HypnosAboutThanatos01|Hypnos About Thanatos 01|Hypnos|Hey, you keep dying! You happen to run into my brother anywhere out there, by any chance? Haven't seen him in ages, what's with the long assignment?
HypnosAboutThanatos01|Hypnos About Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Something about a war. Father sent Thanatos to take stock, but you're right, it's been a while now that you mention it. I guess a lot's occurred down here since then.
HypnosAboutThanatos01|Hypnos About Thanatos 01|Hypnos|I'll say! The lounge re-opened, let's see, what else... Anyway! You see my brother out there you tell him we've got everything here under control!
HypnosAboutThanatos02|Hypnos About Thanatos 02|Hypnos|Hey, did you see? My brother, he's come back! He's here! Somewhere, I think! Good old Thanatos. He's so busy all the time, he... never talks to me! Kind of like your dad with {#DialogueItalicFormat}you{#PreviousFormat}, I guess!
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Whaa{#PreviousFormat}! Oh, hah, you just startled me there, is all, I was just... um... I...
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Zagreus|Hey, uh, everything all right, there, Hypnos?
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Hypnos|Oh, absolutely! Everything {#DialogueItalicFormat}definitely {#PreviousFormat}is. It's just... it's Thanatos. He said some stuff, and... now I'm not so sure I'm doing the best job I can, you know?
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Zagreus|I'm sure he wasn't trying to hurt your feelings. Wait, what am I saying, he's always been harsh with you, hasn't he?
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Hypnos|Hey, what if he doesn't like me anymore? He's got other brothers!
HypnosAboutThanatos04|Hypnos About Thanatos 04|Hypnos|Oh hey! Um, this might be a little weird, but I, {#DialogueItalicFormat}uh{#PreviousFormat}... thanks! I mean, you talked to Thanatos about me, right? At first I thought he was acting funny. But he has definitely been a lot nicer to me, lately!
HypnosAboutThanatos04|Hypnos About Thanatos 04|Zagreus|Come on, Hypnos, I didn't have anything to do with that. You seem like you've been working extra hard, and taking some of the feedback you've been getting to heart. I think Thanatos really appreciates that sort of thing. Who doesn't?
HypnosAboutThanatos04|Hypnos About Thanatos 04|Hypnos|I don't know! But I really appreciate that you went out of your way, I mean... I just stand here and greet and register the dead! But you? You're a real friend!
HypnosAboutThanatosRelationship01|Hypnos About Thanatos Relationship 01|Hypnos|Hey, there you are! So is it true?! You know, about you and Thanatos? Because he told me, and I just said, {#DialogueItalicFormat}whooooaaa{#PreviousFormat}, but then, everything made sense?
HypnosAboutThanatosRelationship01|Hypnos About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|I'm sure whatever it is he said is completely true, yes, Hypnos.
HypnosAboutSleeperSeat01|Hypnos About Sleeper Seat 01|Hypnos|Hey, did you see? Somebody got me this incredible new sleeper-seat right here! Though, I would never lie down while on the job! I'm perfectly all right sleeping while standing up!
HypnosPostFlashback01|Hypnos Post Flashback 01|Zagreus|Hey, Hypnos? What would it take for you to let me through the locked door down the hall?
HypnosPostFlashback01|Hypnos Post Flashback 01|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, that's a good one, you know I can't let you enter your dad's private chambers anymore, since you betrayed his trust and tried to run away from home! Sorry, Master's orders!
HypnosPostEnding01|Hypnos Post Ending 01|Hypnos|Hey, did you see?! The Queen's come back! Though, did she ever take her sweet time!
HypnosPostEnding01|Hypnos Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Hey watch it, Hypnos, that's my mother you're talking about!
HypnosPostEnding01|Hypnos Post Ending 01|Hypnos|What, really? {#DialogueItalicFormat}Huh{#PreviousFormat}! So then {#DialogueItalicFormat}your {#PreviousFormat}mom doesn't spend any time with you, either! We've got something in common!
HypnosPostEnding02|Hypnos Post Ending 02|Hypnos|Wait, wait, wait, so what's all this about you {#DialogueItalicFormat}working {#PreviousFormat}here? I thought they fired you, and that was why you left!
HypnosPostEnding02|Hypnos Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Hypnos... you think all these times I've died, it's because I was upset I was let go from a miserable job?
HypnosPostEpilogue01|Hypnos Post Epilogue 01|Hypnos|I heard the feast you had here, it was really something else! All the gods, together in one place, eating, drinking, not killing one another! That must have been a sight.
HypnosPostEpilogue01|Hypnos Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|You should have been there, Hypnos! Not that I noticed your absence, though, what happened? Other pressing business?
HypnosPostEpilogue01|Hypnos Post Epilogue 01|Hypnos|Slept through the whole thing!
HypnosAutograph01|Hypnos Autograph 01|Zagreus|Hey, Hypnos? This is for all the well-meaning advice you've given me. A little something from a certain double-bladed-axe-wielding, bull-headed, oversized monster of a man who you admire?
HypnosAutograph01|Hypnos Autograph 01|Hypnos|What's this, it's kind of hard to read the hand-writing, it says, no way... {#DialogueItalicFormat}To Hypnos, my biggest fan. Stay vigilant. Asterius. {#PreviousFormat}There's... even a little picture of a bull. You... I... wow... {#DialogueItalicFormat}wow{#PreviousFormat}!
HypnosConsolation01|Hypnos Consolation 01|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Hoh{#PreviousFormat}, says here one of the Wretched Thugs got you, too bad! They're slow but they hit pretty hard I guess. Have you tried moving out of the way?
HypnosConsolation01_B|Hypnos Consolation 01 B|Hypnos|According to my list here, why, you must've just got clobbered all the way back home by one of those Wretched Thugs again! The old moving-out-the-way trick didn't work, huh...?
HypnosConsolation02|Hypnos Consolation 02|Hypnos|Looks like one of the Wretched Witches shot you dead last time, sorry to hear that, huh? Have you tried shooting them first?
HypnosConsolation02_B|Hypnos Consolation 02 B|Hypnos|You must have had a run-in with a Spreader, huh! They're much more talented than the low-grade witches down in Tartarus, so your dad lets them stay warm up in Asphodel, I guess!
HypnosConsolation02_C|Hypnos Consolation 02 C|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oof{#PreviousFormat}, a Splitter zapped you, didn't she! There's lots of witches in your dad's place, huh? Witchcraft must be pretty dangerous for all those mortals up there. Pretty dangerous for you, too!
HypnosConsolation03|Hypnos Consolation 03|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Aw{#PreviousFormat}, looks like you died from one of those nasty booby traps left by a Wretched Pest, little guys who look like urns? Have you tried avoiding them maybe?
HypnosConsolation04|Hypnos Consolation 04|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ooh wow{#PreviousFormat}, so Megaera herself got you last time, that must have been intense! She's fast, and strong, and beautiful, and... um... anyway, I hope the Fates are nicer to you next time!
HypnosConsolation04_B|Hypnos Consolation 04 B|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Hah{#PreviousFormat}! Megaera the Fury got you again! She is unstoppable, isn't she? One time, I tried to stop her on the way to have a chat with your dad, and she didn't even turn her head! {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Sigh...>
HypnosConsolation04_C|Hypnos Consolation 04 C|Hypnos|You got {#DialogueItalicFormat}whipped {#PreviousFormat}by Megaera the Fury! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Eh{#PreviousFormat}?! I always wanted to say that. Whipped, you know? Referring both to how badly you lost, and to that glowy purple whip she's always threatening me with whenever I try to talk to her?
HypnosConsolation05|Hypnos Consolation 05|Hypnos|So you got skewered by a Spike Trap out there, huh? Well, that's too bad! Have you tried not standing there, like, when the spikes come out?
HypnosConsolation06|Hypnos Consolation 06|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ooh {#PreviousFormat}looks like one of those Dart Traps killed you last time, bet {#DialogueItalicFormat}that {#PreviousFormat}must have hurt! Have you tried getting behind something?
HypnosConsolation07|Hypnos Consolation 07|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ow {#PreviousFormat}looks like you got blasted to bits by an explosive urn last time! We keep some really nasty shades all bottled up in those, but... you so much as touch them, {#DialogueItalicFormat}BOOM{#PreviousFormat}! Hah!
HypnosConsolation08|Hypnos Consolation 08|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Whoaaa{#PreviousFormat}, you just got killed by one of those Bloodless Inferno Bomber skeleton type guys, nice! I always wondered what would happen if you just kind of stood around while all their bombs went off!
HypnosConsolation09|Hypnos Consolation 09|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Owie{#PreviousFormat}, looks like the Bone Hydra of Asphodel just stomped you that time, huh? I hear each of its heads has its own nasty tricks. That must be tough!
HypnosConsolation09_B|Hypnos Consolation 09 B|Hypnos|Bone Hydra got you again, huh? Real sorry about that. Though, you know what? I want you to get back out there, you know, all through Tartarus, and Asphodel, again, and knock some sense into it for me, OK? OK!
HypnosConsolation09_C|Hypnos Consolation 09 C|Hypnos|Wait let me guess, don't tell me... you got slaughtered by the Bone Hydra, again! How many times was that? But you will get 'em next time, I just know it! Maybe the time after that. Eventually, no doubt about it!
HypnosConsolation10|Hypnos Consolation 10|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Daw{#PreviousFormat}, one of those Wretched Louts just killed you dead that time, those mean old slappy guys? Maybe try killing them beforehand, I don't know!
HypnosConsolation10_B|Hypnos Consolation 10 B|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ooh{#PreviousFormat}, says here a Wretched Lout slapped you to death again, that's a tough break! Have you tried talking it out, or something, I... I don't know?
HypnosConsolation11|Hypnos Consolation 11|Hypnos|Hey you got turned to ashes by those floating Brimstone crystally type things! Next time one's turning you to charcoal with those beams of theirs, how about you step on over to the side?
HypnosConsolation14|Hypnos Consolation 14|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ooh{#PreviousFormat}, ow, so you got burned down to a crisp out there, standing in magma, right? I know you've got your burning feet and all, but standing in magma, why, I'm not so sure that's a good idea!
HypnosConsolation15|Hypnos Consolation 15|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Huh{#PreviousFormat}, so you walked straight into a burning magma spout, is that what got you this time? Bet if you waited long enough it'd cool off, instead of killing you!
HypnosConsolation16|Hypnos Consolation 16|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Hooh{#PreviousFormat}, looks like one of those little Numbskulls took a big old bite right out of you back there, I guess they got you, huh? Maybe if you weren't quite so tasty, they'd leave you alone! And so would I!
HypnosConsolation16_B|Hypnos Consolation 16 B|Hypnos|Did you just get chomped by one of those little Numbskulls, again?! Oh, that is definitely rough. I guess you must have done something to make the Fates real mad!
HypnosConsolation16_C|Hypnos Consolation 16 C|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh, hohoh, {#PreviousFormat}you got blown up by a Slam-Dancer, I can see it on your face! It also says it on my list! Got everybody's cause of death, right here. Some real morbid stuff from time to time! So anyway, take care!
HypnosConsolation17|Hypnos Consolation 17|Hypnos|Why you look like someone who just got beaten silly by a dirty skeleton! Beaten well beyond the brink of death, I ought to say! And, sure enough, according to my list, you did! Those Bloodless sure are tough!
HypnosConsolation18|Hypnos Consolation 18|Hypnos|My list here says that you got petrified to death that time by some sort of nasty floating gorgon head? No offense to Dusa! Sounds like a pretty painful way to go, though hey! At least you got to be a statue for a little while! I like statues.
HypnosConsolation19|Hypnos Consolation 19|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Pff{#PreviousFormat}, can I just say {#DialogueItalicFormat}ouch{#PreviousFormat}? Because according to the list here, you got flattened like a pancake by a Skull-Crusher, out in Asphodel somewhere! Keep that up and you're going to get even shorter, {#DialogueItalicFormat}haha{#PreviousFormat}!
HypnosConsolation_HitAndRunUnit|Hypnos Consolation Hit And Run Unit|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Mmm{#PreviousFormat}, you look like someone who just got turned to stone then crushed to a bloody pulp by the Megagorgon of Asphodel, am I right? Well, look, I'm sorry to hear that, and before you ask, I won't tell Dusa, don't you worry about that!
HypnosConsolation20|Hypnos Consolation 20|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, I recognize that look! That is the look of someone who just got here after having met a most unfortunate demise, courtesy of the notorious Bloodless Wave-Makers!! How do they make those waves, and why do they hurt so, {#DialogueItalicFormat}so {#PreviousFormat}much? Plenty of time to think it over, now!
HypnosConsolation21|Hypnos Consolation 21|Hypnos|Looks like you {#DialogueItalicFormat}really {#PreviousFormat}took the heat from one of those Bloodless Burn-Flingers back there, didn't you? I know how tempting it can be to try and catch those fiery explosive bombs they throw, but... if I might offer you a bit of personal advice? You really shouldn't do that.
HypnosConsolation22|Hypnos Consolation 22|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}wow{#PreviousFormat}, Alecto's got it out for you...? Normally she doesn't kill anyone, she likes keeping them alive... for quite a while, really. Hurts them still, but doesn't kill them off! I guess she really doesn't like you, huh!
HypnosConsolation_Tisiphone01|Hypnos Consolation Tisiphone 01|Hypnos|If you got killed by Tisiphone the Fury, why, then it must mean you've been accused of {#DialogueItalicFormat}murder{#PreviousFormat}! A most heinous crime, as I'm to understand! Well, I hope you clear your name. Or whatever those mortals do about that stuff!
HypnosConsolation_ShadeSword01|Hypnos Consolation Shade Sword 01|Hypnos|So, you lost a duel to the death with an Exalted Brightsword, did you? They're pretty much the best of the best, so don't feel bad! It had to happen! But if it's any consolation, it'll probably happen again!
HypnosConsolation24|Hypnos Consolation 24|Hypnos|Says here that you got stuck like a piece of meat on a spit by an Exalted Longspear, {#DialogueItalicFormat}wow{#PreviousFormat}, I'll bet that really hurt! Too bad you don't have a thick, leathery hide or something that could help protect you in that type of situation. Oh well!
HypnosConsolation25|Hypnos Consolation 25|Hypnos|Looks like you just got pounded down by an Exalted Greatshield, huh? Did you try attacking while their guard was down? Or, did they just not let down their guard at any point... {#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}...
HypnosConsolation26|Hypnos Consolation 26|Hypnos|Let me guess, you got caught out by one of those Exalted Strongbows, did you there? Next time, if you don't stand around like you're doing here right now, maybe you won't make such an easy target!
HypnosConsolation27|Hypnos Consolation 27|Hypnos|My understanding is you had a little run-in with a Nemean Chariot, just kind of plowed right into you, there, didn't it? You got to watch where you're going crossing the streets of Elysium next time!
HypnosConsolation28|Hypnos Consolation 28|Hypnos|Those Archer Statues in Elysium have got to be a real sight, no doubt about it. But, you can't just stand there and admire them, or else they'll shoot you dead like they did just now!
HypnosConsolation29|Hypnos Consolation 29|Hypnos|Sounds to me like you got {#DialogueItalicFormat}stuck {#PreviousFormat}in more ways than one gawking at a Phalanx Statue in Elysium back there! I got to hand it to your dad. He made sure those look just as good as they stab any intruders like yourself!
HypnosConsolation30|Hypnos Consolation 30|Hypnos|Says here that you got flash-fried to a crisp within a Phoenix Urn's destructive blast back there, I mean, you really ought to stay away from those, if you ask me!
HypnosConsolation31|Hypnos Consolation 31|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Woow{#PreviousFormat}, I can't believe you took on the Minotaur, no way! No wonder you're back here! Everyone knows that he's unstoppable. Especially me! Hey, next you run into him, could you... get his autograph, for me?
HypnosConsolation31_B|Hypnos Consolation 31 B|Hypnos|The Minotaur killed you again, that must have been exciting, huh? {#DialogueItalicFormat}So{#PreviousFormat}, any chance you got that autograph for me, before you got destroyed?
HypnosConsolation31_C|Hypnos Consolation 31 C|Hypnos|Slain by the Minotaur once more, now he's a real beast, there, isn't he! But, tell me something, any progress on that autograph request of mine?
HypnosConsolation32|Hypnos Consolation 32|Hypnos|Oh, I just knew that you'd be back, soon as I heard you faced the Champion of Elysium, himself! You know, I've heard that, among mortals, it's an honor to be killed by somebody like Theseus! Keep it up, and maybe you'll be famous, too!
HypnosConsolation32_B|Hypnos Consolation 32 B|Hypnos|Look, I have to say, I just don't think you have a real chance against both Theseus and the Minotaur, together! But, you might just have a chance to get the Minotaur's autograph for me, if maybe you ask nice or something?
HypnosConsolation32_C|Hypnos Consolation 32 C|Hypnos|Good, you're back! So, prior to when Theseus killed you again back there, did you, by any chance, happen to ask his big bull buddy for an autograph for me, this time?
HypnosConsolation33|Hypnos Consolation 33|Hypnos|Looks like somebody just found out that some types of butterflies are incredibly dangerous! Especially the ones that come swarming out of those Soul Catchers! If only you could just... not have a soul, or something? Then they'd bother somebody else!
HypnosConsolation34|Hypnos Consolation 34|Hypnos|So, one of those Flame Wheels drove right into you, and burst into a fiery explosion, killing both of you, is that what happened there? Well if it makes you feel any better, {#DialogueItalicFormat}technically{#PreviousFormat}, I think this means you got your revenge!
HypnosConsolation35|Hypnos Consolation 35|Hypnos|You had a run-in with those nasty Satyrs all the way up in the Temple of Styx, huh. I can't even imagine the sheer agony, having their lethal poison coursing through my body!
HypnosConsolation36|Hypnos Consolation 36|Hypnos|You know, I've only heard the tales of the gigantic, vicious, flesh-eating vermin up there near the surface. Now I guess we both know that those tales are definitely true!
HypnosConsolation37|Hypnos Consolation 37|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Eugh{#PreviousFormat}, it says here you got chewed up by an angry swarm of Crawlers somewhere just a stone's throw from the exit to your dad's domain? Talk about adding insult to injury, huh?
HypnosConsolation38|Hypnos Consolation 38|Hypnos|Oh, I heard the pests of Tartarus had bigger, meaner counterparts up near the surface, but... I guess you just found out the hard way, huh? When you tripped one of their explosive things?
HypnosConsolation39|Hypnos Consolation 39|Hypnos|I know that look, why, that's the look of someone just incinerated by a Snakestone, am I right? They spit a whole bunch of those white-hot, flesh-burning beams right at the same time, there, don't they?
HypnosConsolation40|Hypnos Consolation 40|Hypnos|Hey, you're back! Wait, wait, what happened? My list says you got killed by a {#DialogueItalicFormat}Redacted{#PreviousFormat}, what's that even mean? I've never seen anything like this!
HypnosConsolation40_B|Hypnos Consolation 40 B|Hypnos|Redacteds got you again, huh. Here's the thing, I keep asking around about them and no one seems to know what I'm talking about! Could you maybe describe them for me, please?
HypnosConsolation40_C|Hypnos Consolation 40 C|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Huh{#PreviousFormat}, that's funny. Nothing on my list at all this time, except... I could have sworn I saw you walk right out of the Pool back there. I'll have to have this thing looked at.
HypnosConsolation41|Hypnos Consolation 41|Hypnos|The list is telling me you caught one of those gigantic Temple saw blades square in the chest, huh? {#DialogueItalicFormat}Eugh{#PreviousFormat}... At least you're back in one piece!
HypnosConsolation42|Hypnos Consolation 42|Hypnos|What's the matter, there, you got a {#DialogueItalicFormat}splitting {#PreviousFormat}headache from those giant falling axes in the Temple of Styx? Well I have just the cure, which is: Don't get hit by them!
HypnosConsolation_PoisonTrap|Hypnos Consolation Poison Trap|Hypnos|Well {#DialogueItalicFormat}somebody {#PreviousFormat}just walked into a cloud of noxious gas, there, huh! Must have lost all your vital functions pretty quickly after that! Next time, you'll know it's seriously deadly stuff, because it killed you! And because it's green!
HypnosConsolation_BiomeTimer|Hypnos Consolation Biome Timer|Hypnos|So, you just plain ran out of time and died, all according to the Pact of Punishment, there, huh? Now that is what I call a {#DialogueItalicFormat}dead{#PreviousFormat}line, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahahaha{#PreviousFormat}!
HypnosConsolation_GunGrenadeDropTrait|Hypnos Consolation Gun Grenade Drop Trait|Hypnos|Why, says here you just blew yourself right up that time, with that weird infernal shooty thing you stole? Remember, next time, shoot the {#DialogueItalicFormat}other {#PreviousFormat}guys!
HypnosConsolation_MiniBossCrawler01|Hypnos Consolation Mini Boss Crawler 01|Hypnos|Whoa, wait wait wait, this just can't be right, it says, it says... {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahahahah{#PreviousFormat}, you got beaten by a tiny little rodent? Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}haha{#PreviousFormat}, sorry I just, I, you have my sympathies.
HypnosConsolation_DiedEarly01|Hypnos Consolation Died Early 01|Hypnos|Wait, {#DialogueItalicFormat}what{#PreviousFormat}, you're back {#DialogueItalicFormat}already{#PreviousFormat}? Hey, my list says that you barely made it out of here before you died! Were you even trying? Because if you were, why, maybe you need to try a whole lot {#DialogueItalicFormat}harder {#PreviousFormat}than that next time!
HypnosConsolation_Wringer01|Hypnos Consolation Wringer 01|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, you got throttled by a Wringer, must have grabbed and crushed you like a grape! You know what grapes are, right? They're like big, squishy pomegranate seeds.
HypnosConsolation_HeavyRangedSplitter01|Hypnos Consolation Heavy Ranged Splitter 01|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}, looks like you ran smack into the Doomstone out in Tartarus, thing gives me the creeps! Next time, try standing perfectly still. That way, it'll all be over that much faster!
HypnosConsolation_WretchAssassin01|Hypnos Consolation Wretch Assassin 01|Hypnos|Hey, you're the latest victim of a Wretched Sneak, that's something, right? They like to get you when you least expect it, so next time, why not keep spinning around and around? Then you'll catch them trying to sneak up!
HypnosConsolation_RangedBurrower01|Hypnos Consolation Ranged Burrower 01|Hypnos|So, let me guess, one minute you were minding your own business out in Asphodel, and then the next, one of those Dracons pops up right in front of you and {#DialogueItalicFormat}pfeh{#PreviousFormat}! Just kills you dead with noxious acid breath. {#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}, well! It happens, right?
HypnosConsolation_BloodlessBerserker01|Hypnos Consolation Bloodless Berserker 01|Hypnos|Going toe-to-toe with one of those Bloodless Bone-Rakers didn't go so well, {#DialogueItalicFormat}huh{#PreviousFormat}? Next time they're ripping you to shreds, remember: That's your signal to be someplace else, instead!
HypnosConsolation_BulletHellWitches01|Hypnos Consolation Bullet Hell Witches 01|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Wow{#PreviousFormat}, you just barged into the Witches Circle out in Asphodel, and they just filled you full of all those stinging purple orbs and killed you, huh? You can't just show up expecting to join their club! You have to study witchcraft for {#DialogueItalicFormat}years{#PreviousFormat}!
HypnosConsolation_Charon01|Hypnos Consolation Charon 01|Hypnos|Hey, my brother {#DialogueItalicFormat}Charon {#PreviousFormat}killed you, am I seeing this right? He's never been particularly nice to {#DialogueItalicFormat}me{#PreviousFormat}! Whacked me with his oar a couple times, but it never got {#DialogueItalicFormat}that {#PreviousFormat}bad. Must be some misunderstanding, have you talked to him?
HypnosConsolation_Charon02|Hypnos Consolation Charon 02|Hypnos|You had it out with Charon again, huh? And turned out like it did before! The thing you have to understand is he's got {#DialogueItalicFormat}lots {#PreviousFormat}of upper body strength. You seen the definition in his arms? Maybe try some rowing for yourself!
HypnosConsolation_BWrapping01|Hypnos Consolation B Wrapping 01|Hypnos|So you met a violent end aboard the infamous Barge of Death sailing the river of flame! Surrounded by skeletons bleeding you dry, Voidstones making all of them invincible...! Have you thought about taking a different barge?
HypnosConsolation_RunCleared01|Hypnos Consolation Run Cleared 01|Hypnos|Whoa, what happened to you, you just... died? You just plain {#DialogueItalicFormat}died{#PreviousFormat}, like... nothing stabbed you, bludgeoned you, poisoned you, burned you, crushed you, blew you to bits, turned you to stone, but... you're back here! Must have been those {#DialogueItalicFormat}Natural Causes {#PreviousFormat}mortals talk about!
HypnosConsolation_RunCleared02|Hypnos Consolation Run Cleared 02|Hypnos|Natural Causes got you again, huh? That's a real shame, I mean, imagine one day you're just going about your business, and then {#DialogueItalicFormat}ack{#PreviousFormat}!! You're {#DialogueItalicFormat}dead{#PreviousFormat}! Although I guess {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}don't have to imagine it like {#DialogueItalicFormat}I {#PreviousFormat}do!
HypnosConsolation_RunCleared03|Hypnos Consolation Run Cleared 03|Hypnos|Darned Natural Causes got you once again, there, didn't they? Well, you show them next time! Would you do that for me, {#DialogueItalicFormat}huh{#PreviousFormat}?
HypnosWithHades01|Hypnos With Hades 01|Hades|...You're late with your report, Hypnos. Again. Again! The dead of course can wait, but I'm less patient. Now, explain yourself to me.
HypnosWithHades01|Hypnos With Hades 01|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}! Well, let's see, I woke up, I don't know what time it was, and I made sure that every shade had been accounted for, just like I always do, except I couldn't find my list at first, can you believe it? I thought maybe my brother played a little prank, and so...
HypnosWithHades01|Hypnos With Hades 01|Hades|Get to the blasted point already, I don't have all day! Or night. {#DialogueItalicFormat}Urgh{#PreviousFormat}! Your report, where is it?
HypnosWithHades01|Hypnos With Hades 01|Hypnos|Sure I was just getting to it, Master! My list, I found it over by the lounge, it was inside, but I am not the one who put it there, no sir! So I've been making positively sure it's not been tampered with, that it has everybody's name, cause of death, place of birth, former body weight, any previous allergies or medications...
HypnosWithHades01|Hypnos With Hades 01|Hades|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Enough{#PreviousFormat}!! Blood and darkness, that's enough from you, just... see to it the ledger of the dead is accurate, and get back to your post. {#DialogueItalicFormat}Ugh{#PreviousFormat}, would that you could be more like your brother.
HypnosWithHades02|Hypnos With Hades 02|Hades|...Your reports have been much more punctual of late, Hypnos. That is to be expected. However... the illustrated edges... a clever detail. Ensures certain reports are easily procured from a stack of parchment.
HypnosWithHades02|Hypnos With Hades 02|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}thanks{#PreviousFormat}, Master, glad you like those! Ever since Thanatos made pretty clear to me I was about to lose my job, I started keeping a list of my {#DialogueItalicFormat}own {#PreviousFormat}tasks, which I sort through each day, deciding on priority, estimating time to completion, cost-benefit analysis...
HypnosWithHades02|Hypnos With Hades 02|Hades|Yes, well. Certainly, then, you have a number of such tasks requiring your attention. Continue working diligently, then.
HypnosWithHades03|Hypnos With Hades 03|Hypnos|Master, I just can't thank you enough for putting my picture on the board there in the lounge! I heard it's a good picture! I haven't had time to see it yet, but I am going to, it's on the list!
HypnosWithHades03|Hypnos With Hades 03|Hades|Hypnos... that shall be all. Lest I rescind your commendation and cast you out of here.
HypnosWithHades03|Hypnos With Hades 03|Hypnos|....Um, could you say all that again with smaller words, Master, because I thought it maybe sounded kind of {#DialogueItalicFormat}bad{#PreviousFormat}?
HypnosWithNyx01|Hypnos With Nyx 01|Hypnos|...I just get sleepy, sometimes, Mom, I mean, I've been working so {#DialogueItalicFormat}much{#PreviousFormat}, lately, just over there? You've probably seen me, greeting shades, making my list, creating a welcoming environment...
HypnosWithNyx01|Hypnos With Nyx 01|Nyx|Remember what we previously spoke of, Hypnos. Do not address me thus whilst we are here. Conduct yourself as befitting a servant of the House of Hades... and, continue practicing your independence, please.
HypnosWithNyx02|Hypnos With Nyx 02|Nyx|You have demonstrated sustained competence in your duties, Hypnos. It gladdens me to see measurable progress. Your efforts are to be commended.
HypnosWithNyx02|Hypnos With Nyx 02|Hypnos|Aw, wow, {#DialogueItalicFormat}thanks{#PreviousFormat}! Commended by whom, exactly? Megaera? Thanatos? Dusa, maybe! Not the Master himself?!
HypnosWithNyx02|Hypnos With Nyx 02|Nyx|Commended by me. I cannot always look after all of my children, as you know. It falls upon them to take care of themselves, as well as their obligations to our domain. As your mother... it is reassuring to see that you are capable.
HypnosWithNyx02|Hypnos With Nyx 02|Hypnos|Capable? Me? {#DialogueItalicFormat}Aw{#PreviousFormat}, Mom... I mean, um, {#DialogueItalicFormat}Mother Nyx{#PreviousFormat}! Nobody's {#DialogueItalicFormat}ever {#PreviousFormat}called me that before!
HypnosWithNyx02|Hypnos With Nyx 02|Nyx|You are my son. It is to be expected. However... I know it is not effortless, to be of use. Continue to do well. I shall be watching.
HypnosWithPersephone01|Hypnos With Persephone 01|Hypnos|...And if you ever need {#DialogueItalicFormat}anything {#PreviousFormat}at all, Your Royalness, you can {#DialogueItalicFormat}always {#PreviousFormat}find me wide awake, right over there! Though I really shouldn't leave my post like this! Not even for {#DialogueItalicFormat}you{#PreviousFormat}!
HypnosChat01|Hypnos Chat 01|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades! Glory in Death!
HypnosChat02|Hypnos Chat 02|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, where death is our life!
HypnosChat03|Hypnos Chat 03|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, where death is our business!
HypnosChat04|Hypnos Chat 04|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, and thanks for dying!
HypnosChat05|Hypnos Chat 05|Hypnos|Just keeping watch over the Pool of Styx, there, same as always!
HypnosChat06|Hypnos Chat 06|Hypnos|They won't catch me sleeping on the job again!
HypnosChat07|Hypnos Chat 07|Hypnos|Oh, hey, I didn't see you come in, {#DialogueItalicFormat}um{#PreviousFormat}... welcome back!
HypnosChat08|Hypnos Chat 08|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Whoa{#PreviousFormat}, I guess you must have died out there again, huh.
HypnosChat09|Hypnos Chat 09|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}whoa{#PreviousFormat}, you're back already, that's too bad!
HypnosChat10|Hypnos Chat 10|Hypnos|Oh, hi, um, you're welcome! Just, go right ahead, I guess!
HypnosChat11|Hypnos Chat 11|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Um{#PreviousFormat}, I was just resting my eyes... you won't tell anybody, right?
HypnosChat12|Hypnos Chat 12|Hypnos|Well, you know what they say: There is no escape!
HypnosChat13|Hypnos Chat 13|Hypnos|Hey, you look like you could use some sleep!
HypnosChat14|Hypnos Chat 14|Hypnos|Oh, it's you, just, come on in, you're on the list!
HypnosChat15|Hypnos Chat 15|Hypnos|You're back, huh? That was pretty soon I guess!
HypnosChat16|Hypnos Chat 16|Hypnos|You must be pretty used to dying like this, huh?
HypnosChat18|Hypnos Chat 18|Hypnos|The Fates are pretty mean to keep on doing this to you!
HypnosChat19|Hypnos Chat 19|Hypnos|Thanks for dying, nice to see you here again!
HypnosChat20|Hypnos Chat 20|Hypnos|Go right ahead, I'll get you all signed in!
HypnosChat21|Hypnos Chat 21|Hypnos|Good thing you're basically immortal, huh?
HypnosChat22|Hypnos Chat 22|Hypnos|Guess you're here to stay, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hah-ha{#PreviousFormat}!
HypnosChat23|Hypnos Chat 23|Hypnos|There's always next time, isn't there?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat01|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 01|Hypnos|How's my best friend doing, {#DialogueItalicFormat}huh{#PreviousFormat}?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat02|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 02|Hypnos|You'll get them next time, right?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat03|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 03|Hypnos|Don't let me keep you, huh?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat04|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 04|Hypnos|Signed you in, you're good to go!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat05|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 05|Hypnos|I like having a best friend!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat06|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 06|Hypnos|Glad you died so I could talk to you!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat07|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 07|Hypnos|Nice to have a heart-to-heart like this, you know?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat08|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 08|Hypnos|See you next time you die, OK?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat09|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 09|Hypnos|Hope you enjoy your stay!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat10|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 10|Hypnos|I've got a survey here if you'd like to fill it out?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat11|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 11|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades! Just come on in!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat12|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 12|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of... oh, you know!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat13|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 13|Hypnos|Welcome back to our most frequent guest!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat14A|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 14 A|Hypnos|I want you to go out there, and {#DialogueItalicFormat}die {#PreviousFormat}some other way!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat14|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 14|Hypnos|There's no escape, in case you hadn't heard!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat15|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 15|Hypnos|You can {#DialogueItalicFormat}do {#PreviousFormat}this! Whatever it is you're doing!
HypnosGift01|Hypnos Gift 01|Zagreus|Surprise, Hypnos! I got you this.
HypnosGift01|Hypnos Gift 01|Hypnos|Whoa whoa {#DialogueItalicFormat}whoa {#PreviousFormat}you can't bring that in here! Hah, just kidding, thanks! But wait, I'll trade you, look!
HypnosGift02|Hypnos Gift 02|Hypnos|Oh! Wow! Thanks! This is real nice of you, hah! I sure am glad you died out there just now!
HypnosGift02|Hypnos Gift 02|Zagreus|I'm glad I died, as well, Hypnos! I'm glad I died, as well.
HypnosGift03|Hypnos Gift 03|Hypnos|Ah, neat! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Huh{#PreviousFormat}, thanks!! It's not so bad that you keep coming back like this, is it? At least for me it isn't!
HypnosGift03|Hypnos Gift 03|Zagreus|I'm getting used to it. Though I don't think I'd feel particularly welcome anymore if not for you, Hypnos.
HypnosGift04|Hypnos Gift 04|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Whoaaa {#PreviousFormat}you must've really gotten pretty far out there if you could get me one of these, so, wow! And thanks for stopping by!
HypnosGift04|Hypnos Gift 04|Zagreus|You lighten up my numerous untimely deaths, Hypnos.
HypnosGift05|Hypnos Gift 05|Hypnos|Hah, well this is like a dream come true! I mean, how come you're always being so darn nice to me? But anyway, {#DialogueItalicFormat}um{#PreviousFormat}, thanks!
HypnosGift05|Hypnos Gift 05|Zagreus|Sure thing, Hypnos! Knock yourself out.
HypnosGift06|Hypnos Gift 06|Hypnos|Oh you are just the best, I bet you died on purpose just to get this back to me, didn't you! Didn't you?
HypnosGift06|Hypnos Gift 06|Zagreus|I have a secret, Hypnos. I've died on purpose every single time, just to see you.
HypnosGift07|Hypnos Gift 07|Zagreus|Hypnos, wanted to say you have really helped the thought of my coming back here time after time, painful death by death, not be inherently abhorrent. Your greetings really help! So I wanted you to have this.
HypnosGift07|Hypnos Gift 07|Hypnos|But, but, but, wait, this, it's {#DialogueItalicFormat}Ambrosia{#PreviousFormat}! You are not supposed to have this here! We could both get in a lot of trouble, and I mean a {#DialogueItalicFormat}lot{#PreviousFormat}, if they catch us in the middle of this totally forbidden exchange!
HypnosGift07|Hypnos Gift 07|Zagreus|I notice that you haven't yet returned the bottle to me, which I'm going to take as an indication that you're going to hang onto it.
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Zagreus|One more forbidden exchange, Hypnos. Sometimes when I'm out there and about to die, I catch myself thinking... well, at least Hypnos will share one of his deep insights about why it is I utterly failed. So here! For all your generous advice.
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Hypnos|Aww, I... feel like I am going to cry, I mean, all my advice is free! You really didn't have to do this. But I sure am glad you did! Even if it is highly illegal! I... I... I...!
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Zagreus|You what, Hypnos? You what?
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Hypnos|...I think you could be my best friend! Have you... tried being my best friend?
ThanatosWithHypnos01|Thanatos With Hypnos 01|Thanatos|Hypnos, really, that is the worst idea I think I've ever heard. Do you understand how little sense that makes?
ThanatosWithHypnos01|Thanatos With Hypnos 01|Hypnos|I'm just saying, maybe if you just, I don't know, had all the mortals die at the same time, it'd save you a bunch of trips, and then we'd have more time to spend together, huh?
ThanatosWithHypnos01|Thanatos With Hypnos 01|Thanatos|I don't know why I bother with you, honestly. Get back to work, and let me do the same.
ThanatosWithHypnos02|Thanatos With Hypnos 02|Thanatos|You cannot keep falling asleep on the job like this, Hypnos. This is completely unacceptable.
ThanatosWithHypnos02|Thanatos With Hypnos 02|Hypnos|Oh I just nodded off a little while, Thanatos! I rest easy knowing that you're here! But if I goofed, why, I guess you could kill me dead, or something, huh?
ThanatosWithHypnos02|Thanatos With Hypnos 02|Thanatos|Don't give me any ideas. Pull yourself together, and quit slacking off. The House needs help, and you've got a job to do. Now get to it!
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Thanatos With Hypnos 03|Thanatos|...Hypnos, this list has a bunch of tasks from I don't know how long ago, I mean... I took several of these last year! And you've already submitted this week's registrations, why isn't that marked complete?
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Thanatos With Hypnos 03|Hypnos|Don't you know it, I was just about to get to that! Then you showed up, and I got so distracted, it just kind of slipped my mind! It happens, right?
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Thanatos With Hypnos 03|Thanatos|You need to focus, Brother. Or it'll be Lord Hades reprimanding you again, and that is not something you want.
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Thanatos With Hypnos 03|Hypnos|Oh, I don't know about that, last time I talked to Master he made {#DialogueItalicFormat}pretty clear {#PreviousFormat}he never wanted to speak to me again!
ThanatosWithHypnos04|Thanatos With Hypnos 04|Thanatos|Hypnos, you're not irreplaceable, you understand? If you don't shape up, quickly, someone else is going to have your job.
ThanatosWithHypnos04|Thanatos With Hypnos 04|Hypnos|Oh I hear you loud and clear, Thanatos! And, let me tell you, they will have the {#DialogueItalicFormat}greatest job in all the Underworld{#PreviousFormat}!
ThanatosWithHypnos04|Thanatos With Hypnos 04|Thanatos|I feel like I'm not getting through to you, Brother. Well, after the inevitable happens, don't come telling me I didn't try.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Thanatos With Hypnos 05|Thanatos|...Well, how often do you consult these lists you make? If you're spending too much time just making lists, you're not leaving time to get anything done.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Thanatos With Hypnos 05|Hypnos|Oh, I {#DialogueItalicFormat}love {#PreviousFormat}making my lists... I always illustrate the edges, each one is {#DialogueItalicFormat}unique{#PreviousFormat}! That way anyone who gets to review the work, it's a whole {#DialogueItalicFormat}experience{#PreviousFormat}, you know? But... I guess it does take up a lot of time.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Thanatos With Hypnos 05|Thanatos|You'll have to work around the constraints of your responsibilities. You do take breaks, don't you? Before and after each break, maybe that's a time to make sure your own list of priorities is up-to-date.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Thanatos With Hypnos 05|Hypnos|Wait, my own list of priorities...? But, you're saying I can just go and make a list... for me? Huh. Whoa. {#DialogueItalicFormat}Whoa{#PreviousFormat}....
ThanatosWithHypnos06|Thanatos With Hypnos 06|Thanatos|I've heard that your reports have been immaculate of late, Hypnos. I have to know, who's helping you with them? It can't be Zagreus.
ThanatosWithHypnos06|Thanatos With Hypnos 06|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}haha{#PreviousFormat}, no, he doesn't help. It's just I took to listing only the important stuff up top, and spending just a bit more time on the priority reports, and... guess it's working out!
ThanatosWithHypnos06|Thanatos With Hypnos 06|Thanatos|Look, whatever the case... the work's improved. It's been observed. You ought to keep it up.
ThanatosWithHypnos07|Thanatos With Hypnos 07|Thanatos|...Though, what I mean to say is, that... I'm sorry, Hypnos. You're my brother, but I haven't always treated you that way. Would you be willing to forgive me?
ThanatosWithHypnos07|Thanatos With Hypnos 07|Hypnos|Aww, come on, Thanatos, are you kidding me, right here? We're like two skeletons in a crypt! You're the best, and you're always looking out for me. Even when you're not around for what can seem like aeons at a time!
ThanatosWithHypnos07|Thanatos With Hypnos 07|Thanatos|Well let's not get ahead of ourselves, here. We each have got important jobs to do. Isn't that right, Brother?
ThanatosWithHypnos08|Thanatos With Hypnos 08|Thanatos|...Congratulations, Brother! I saw you finally made the board. You made us proud.
ThanatosWithHypnos08|Thanatos With Hypnos 08|Hypnos|Sure did! That's something, huh? Though, sorry Thanatos, can't really chat right now, the shades are stacking up, there's greetings to be done, and sign-ins... lots of work to do, you know?
ThanatosWithHypnos08|Thanatos With Hypnos 08|Thanatos|I definitely know the feeling. Well then, let's keep it up, the both of us, all right?
DusaWithHypnos01|Dusa With Hypnos 01|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}uh{#PreviousFormat}, hey there, Dusa! How's your endless toil treating you?
DusaWithHypnos01|Dusa With Hypnos 01|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Um{#PreviousFormat}, Mister Hypnos, do you... maybe think that you could, you know, {#DialogueItalicFormat}uh{#PreviousFormat}, keep an eye on the procession line before Lord Hades? Like you were supposed to...?
DusaWithHypnos01|Dusa With Hypnos 01|Hypnos|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}! Um, that's no problem, I can definitely do that, I'll just add it to the list!
DusaWithHypnos01|Dusa With Hypnos 01|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Um{#PreviousFormat}, good, then! Glad we had a chance to chat. Now, maybe get some sleep or something. You look pretty beat...?
DusaWithHypnos02|Dusa With Hypnos 02|Dusa|Mister Hypnos, I, {#DialogueItalicFormat}uh{#PreviousFormat}, wanted to check in with you again, regarding the procession line that's... right in front of you, right over there, it's... moving pretty slow.
DusaWithHypnos02|Dusa With Hypnos 02|Hypnos|I {#DialogueItalicFormat}know{#PreviousFormat}! Those shades, they just go on and on, and {#DialogueItalicFormat}on and on{#PreviousFormat}, forever, blathering about this or that! I mean, Lord Hades, it's a wonder he can {#DialogueItalicFormat}stand {#PreviousFormat}it, listening to them every day or night!
DusaWithHypnos02|Dusa With Hypnos 02|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Um{#PreviousFormat}, well, it's just, I think you were supposed to keep things moving, so, if they're taking too long, I guess that maybe you could say something, or... any bright ideas?
DusaWithHypnos02|Dusa With Hypnos 02|Hypnos|It's a toughie, Dusa, because I think it's important that the shades who wait their turn, why, that they get a chance to say their piece! But it's a real tricky situation you bring up, so, let me tell you what I'm going to do: I am going to sleep on it! And then, get back to you!
DusaWithHypnos02|Dusa With Hypnos 02|Dusa|OK, well... if you don't, though, I'll check in with you again, later, I guess? Because, I'm under orders, so... {#DialogueItalicFormat}um{#PreviousFormat}... bye...
DusaWithHypnos03|Dusa With Hypnos 03|Hypnos|Heya Dusa, let me guess! You're here regarding the procession of these shades, who have been standing here for quite some time, clogging the hall a bit... they've barely moved at all!
DusaWithHypnos03|Dusa With Hypnos 03|Dusa|Y, you guessed it, Mister Hypnos, so... have you, um, given any thought to maybe focusing the traffic flow through here a little bit, to keep the hallway clearer, and, oh, I don't know, put some sort of time limit in place?
DusaWithHypnos03|Dusa With Hypnos 03|Hypnos|You know, can't say I have! I've got my registration list, and I have had to keep a careful eye on it, with all the shades that have been pouring in? It's really gotten slow around here!
DusaWithHypnos03|Dusa With Hypnos 03|Dusa|It definitely has, I... have to go, um, hope you get yourself some rest, OK?
DusaWithHypnos04|Dusa With Hypnos 04|Dusa|I can't believe it, Mister Hypnos, how... {#DialogueItalicFormat}how did you do it{#PreviousFormat}? All the shades that have been lining up, they... they've been moving right along!
DusaWithHypnos04|Dusa With Hypnos 04|Hypnos|You know, you're right, {#DialogueItalicFormat}they have{#PreviousFormat}! They definitely have. It's pretty hard to notice, since they're slow, but I have a keen eye. And so do you! You noticed before I did in this case. What did you say your question was back there?
DusaWithHypnos04|Dusa With Hypnos 04|Dusa|I asked you how you did it, got the traffic flow moving a little faster, and... it's the sarcophagus things, isn't it? Right down the hall! The shades, they're scared to stand around! That's brilliant, Mister Hypnos, I'm impressed!
DusaWithHypnos04|Dusa With Hypnos 04|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, that, well, really, it was nothing, Dusa! Though, I'll tell you something! It is good to know that you're impressed with me!
DusaWithHypnos04|Dusa With Hypnos 04|Dusa|I, {#DialogueItalicFormat}haha{#PreviousFormat}, don't know if I'd go that far, um, anyway! I'll mark this as resolved!
MegaeraWithHypnos01|Megaera With Hypnos 01|Megaera|...Would you look at that, Hypnos. Care to repeat to me the unsolicited advice you just now offered, now that Zagreus is here?
MegaeraWithHypnos01|Megaera With Hypnos 01|Hypnos|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, well, it is my custom to give pointers to our visitors, who come involuntarily, because, I do pick up a lot of bits and pieces, talking here to everyone! About, you know... dying?
MegaeraWithHypnos01|Megaera With Hypnos 01|Megaera|Zagreus. He told me that I ought to evade more of your attacks next time. So you just watch your back out there, because I know your secrets thanks to Hypnos here.
MegaeraWithHypnos02|Megaera With Hypnos 02|Megaera|...I think that I can find the lounge well on my own, Hypnos. Or... wait... what is this, did you just ask me out?
MegaeraWithHypnos02|Megaera With Hypnos 02|Hypnos|Me? No, {#DialogueItalicFormat}nonononono{#PreviousFormat}, no! I'd never even think to do that, Miss, I mean, you have your station, and I have mine. We're from two different worlds, you could say. Fated never to be seen together much.
MegaeraWithHypnos02|Megaera With Hypnos 02|Megaera|Every time I talk to you, you somehow take it as a compliment, is that correct? Then, let me give {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}some advice, for once. Stop being an idiot.
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Megaera With Hypnos 03|Megaera|...You haven't greeted me as often lately, Hypnos. I wouldn't have noticed if it weren't half your job. If there's something you wish to say to me, why not just come right out.
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Megaera With Hypnos 03|Hypnos|Oh, um, well, I, see, the thing is, Megaera, Miss Megaera, mind if I call you that? As I was saying, I just, thought maybe, you know, we had a thing, a real connection, lately, since you keep on dying more and more, and I keep standing here? But then... I always thought you were invincible...
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Megaera With Hypnos 03|Megaera|I see. And so you're realizing now that your entire image of me came from your imagination, is that it?
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Megaera With Hypnos 03|Hypnos|Well, it's just! I really thought with all my advice that you'd go back to killing Zagreus, rather than the other way around! I just don't think things are working out the way I hoped, you know?
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Megaera With Hypnos 03|Megaera|It almost sounds as though you've broken up with me, except... well, are you sure that you'll be all right?
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Megaera With Hypnos 03|Hypnos|Oh, yeah! Look, I'm just glad it's one of you two, sure beats having to greet shades nonstop! They never talk to me.
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Megaera With Hypnos 03|Megaera|All right, then... you greet me next I'm here.
