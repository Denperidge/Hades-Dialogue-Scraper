|"My sisters and I. We've had a chance to talk, and we have come to an agreement, Zagreus. As you can see."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Megaera, Tis, you ready?"
|-
|'''Tisiphone'''
|"''Mmurdererr''!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Three against one. Doesn't seem all that sporting, now, does it?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"We're each well past the need for any sport. We'll kill you, whatever it takes. Erinyes! ''Now''."

|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Sister Union With Meg 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Ugh'', would you just ''look ''at him! That smug look, that posture, ''everything''! Please tell me you're not going soft for this trash-god, Sister."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Come on, Alecto. When was the last time that we looked to one another for approval? Besides, as long as we kill him, what do you even care?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You know, fair point, there, Sister! Very nicely said. ''Let's kill him, now''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Sister Union With Meg 02
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Look at this awful piece of trash, come here again to bleed all over our nice shiny floor. Ready to fight my lovely sister, there, redblood?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"He's not so awful once you get to know him, Sis. Not that it matters for what we're about to do."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"The both of you disgust me, Meg, you know that? Get it together and ''kill ''him this time, damn you!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Pact Reaction 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You must have gone and signed a Pact! Isn't that right, redblood? Tell me right now."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, as a matter of fact, I have. Though I don't see how that's any business of yours, Alecto."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"I like working ''alone''! And you don't see me doing that, right now, do you? So I would say it's my business, all right. Along with killing ''you''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Pact Disabled Reaction 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Whew'', I thought I'd never get some quiet time again, you know, redblood? That damned Pact you stupidly agreed to, making me work with my sisters again. I'll get you for that!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sensing a pattern that it really doesn't take much for you to have something to ''get ''me for, does it?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Oh, that's rich! How smart of you, you're ''smart''! Know what? I'll get you for that, too."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 First Appearance
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Ah, hah hah, hohohohohhh. ''Finally. I've been waiting for this! Really."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You must be one of Megaera's lovely sisters, I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Waiting for what, exactly?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"...So sick of, you know, doing my regular job, uninterrupted. Not having to clean up Meg's messes!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I get the feeling we're starting off on the wrong foot."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Anyway. I always wanted to kill a god. You'll have to do."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Post Ending 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Heard rumblings about some news back at your daddy's House, redblood. So his illustrious abducted Queen, she's come back home?!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, how do you even know all that? And should you really be talking about the Queen that way?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"I don't answer to her! She can come and go as she wants for all I care. But you want to know who can't?! Yeah, you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Post Ending 02
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"I got to ask, how come you keep on showing up, redblood? I thought you would have had enough beatings by now."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, you know, I've come to enjoy these visits with you so much, Alecto, that I've made it something of a regular routine. Form good habits, and then stick to them, I say!"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You call this a good habit, huh? Maybe for me, it is. Well, come here all you like, and I will be here waiting, ''every single time''! About once every three times, anyway."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Heard you had a real bash down in your daddy's House, redblood. So sorry I couldn't make it. Next time, though, all right?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Next time, definitely, Alecto. We missed you for sure and wish you could have made it!"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Hohoho'', I'm sure you did. But, you know, work comes first! So let's get busy."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 End Of Discussion 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Hey, redblood. I have done a lot of thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that I want you ''never ''to speak to me again. ''Ever''. Got that?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...''Erm'', I don't know how to respond to what you said without directly disobeying your request, Alecto. But for future reference, fine, I'll bite."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You'll ''die''! There's no use standing here flapping our gums when we could cut to killing one another right away. Come on!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Low Health 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Ahh'', look at you, redblood. You're practically already dead! Now that's no fun at all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sorry to disappoint you, Alecto. I know you enjoy being responsible for a hundred percent of my bloodshed."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Oh, that's all right, no hard feelings at all! You just be sure to get in better health before next I get to kill you, hm?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Low Health 02
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You know I smelled your blood from three chambers away? Hope you saved some of it for me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I've saved some of my blood, yes! Though I was thinking I'd hang onto it for now, if you don't mind."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Do I look like someone who doesn't mind, trash god? I'll take your blood, however much you've got."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Low Health 03
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"What's the matter, redblood? You look a little paler than usual. Been bleeding much, having to get this far?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I ran into some setbacks, if you have to know. But don't worry, I'm sure I've plenty left to bleed."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Oh ''whew'', that's a relief all right! I was so worried that I wasn't going to be the one to kill you this time."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Low Health 04
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You're looking pretty beat already, there, redblood. So let's finish you off."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Low Health 05
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Next time, don't you go losing so much blood before you get here, trash! I like to take it out of you myself."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You're no god! You're nothing but a piece of trash. Born into all of this. And you don't even want it!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You seem to have me all figured out. And here I thought we were still getting to know each other."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Tsch''. Well. You want to know what I want? Here, I'll show you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 02
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You know what I like about you? The way you bleed. ''Mmm''."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That... is not the type of flattery I'm used to. You're making me a bit uncomfortable, I'll have you know."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Never met a god that bleeds like you. Red. Like a worthless mortal. Come on! Let's bleed you dry."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 03
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Let's get to work, redblood, what do you say? Me, I say you've kept this girl waiting long enough."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, I say I don't appreciate you calling me redblood. You're making me rather self-conscious about it, you know."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Oh, hoho'', you're funny. But you'll break. They always do."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 04
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"I have got to admit, you are really frustrating, you know, redblood? What is it going to take to make you scream, hm?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you mean to say Meg never told you? And here I thought you two were close."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Ehh'', we'll find out. I've got plenty of ideas left I've been meaning to try."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 05
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You know something, redblood? In retrospect, I should have known this wasn't going to be a quick job."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"They say both gods and mortals are notoriously poor at estimating how long it takes to get anything done."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Normally when I'm on the job, they grovel, then they scream. They shut up eventually, but not you. At least, not yet."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 06
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Huh''! You really must like pain an awful lot, redblood. Or maybe it's just me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You see, Alecto? Turns out we do have a common interest after all."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Did you just--? Don't you ''ever ''compare yourself to me again, you trash. You want more pain, I'm happy to oblige."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 07
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"I've got a lot to be thankful for, you know, redblood? Your daddy could have shut you in the lowest pits, and then we never would have met!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Perish the thought, Alecto. What would you have done with yourself if not for all our fated encounters?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"I don't know! I mean, before we met, I flayed all sorts of other trash down here! But lately I've been keeping them waiting, because of you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 08
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Good job, redblood! You made it all this way! But, I have got to send you back to daddy, now. Nothing personal!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wish you could join me, Alecto. Want me to put in a good word with Father next time, so you can come visit us at the House yourself?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Oh, you know, I'd rather have my eyes put out, but thanks for offering! Now, time to head on home."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 09
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You know, redblood, my appointments usually don't come to ''me'', much less again and again! Think I'm here to show you a good time, huh?!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Alecto, I just like to see you menacingly smile. And, hey, having to deal with you now and again beats having to fight Meg all the time."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Whaa''?! You think dealing with ''me ''beats dealing with that ''weakling''? ''Graaaah''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Misc Encounter 10
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"How many times is it going to take, redblood? ''How many''?! Tell me! How can you stand running into me like this, over and over?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, habits can be hard to break. As for how many times, I've really no idea. Though I guess there's one way to find out."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"I'll give you one thing... I like it when my prey bites back. Come on, let's see some blood again."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 About Tisiphone Speech 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Tisiphone's started to say the strangest things, lately, redblood. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, don't fret. I was just trying to help her expand her somewhat limited vocabulary."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Stay out of her head!! You really think she's got something to learn from you? Learn to shut up from her!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 About Megaera Relationship 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Eugh'', still can't believe Megaera got mixed up with you, redblood. For all her weakness, I always thought at least she took her job here seriously. ''Eh'', live and learn!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Not interested in your nasty remarks about her, Alecto. Though if you keep them up, I'm warning you, I might get mad."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Ohh'', you might get ''mad''? Defend Megaera's honor, since she's far too weak to do it her damn self? You think she's so pure! ''Hahaha''! You're disgusting! Both of you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Win Streak 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Oh hey, redblood! You're back for more. I like that stubborn stupidness about you, honestly. If only I could keep you alive even longer this time."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you planning to kill me with insults this time?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Haven't decided how just yet. This girl likes a little spontaneity."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Win Streak 02
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Huh''! Normally my marks don't make a habit of seeking me out again after I'm through with them."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I can imagine that, it's just, I've really come to appreciate these little back-and-forth exchanges that we have."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Ugh'', I do so hate to let you down like this, redblood. But you're just not my type. Maybe I'll finally get it through your head this time."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Lose Streak 01
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Know something, redblood? Try as I might, I still have not forgiven you for beating me last time. Call it a crippling character flaw, I don't know..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Forgiveness can take time. Though self-reflection is a healthy step. We're making progress!"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You think we're making progress? Here? ''Ah, hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, ''why you piece of trash! I'll show you progress."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Lose Streak 02
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Redblood, I'm getting awful sick of seeing your smug face, time, after time, after time."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Have you given any thought to just... leaving me alone, and going back to wherever it is you came from?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"You see? That is ''exactly ''what I mean. To think that Megaera had to put up with you for, I don't know how long."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Lose Streak 03
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Damn you for this, redblood. You're making me look bad, you know? Making me ''feel ''bad."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Alecto, I didn't ask you to repeatedly attempt to kill me. How did you expect me to respond?"
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Ah-hahah-hahaha, hahah'', you do know what happens when you make me ''feel ''bad, don't you...?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury 2 Lose Streak 04
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"''Huh'', it's the god of trash, come once again to filthy up this place! You're getting real predictable, you know."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Considering I beat you last we met, I'd be much more concerned with your predictability than mine."
|-
|'''Alecto'''
|"Don't want to hear it from you, trash! Just want to see you bleed. Now you come here!"
