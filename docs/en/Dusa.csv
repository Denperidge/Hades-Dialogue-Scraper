BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Um{#PreviousFormat}, Zagreus? I wanted to talk some more, if you're available? I mean, if you're free. I mean! If you have time to right now. Is that OK?
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|Of course, Dusa! Where should we chat? The lounge, or maybe somewhere more private...?
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|Somewhere more private, please, if that's OK? Thank you.
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|...Um, Zagreus... so, ever since you told me you had feelings for me, it's been, like... my whole mind is on fire. I haven't been able to think straight, or get anything done. It's all been so much!
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|I'm sorry, Dusa, I... put a lot on you, and... maybe I shouldn't have, since I'm the Prince and everything, as you point out, and... sometimes, I forget myself. I'd never pressure you, it's just... I thought you had these feelings for me, too.

BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, look, there's nothing to apologize for, not at all. In fact... all this is a relief.

DusaPostEnding03|Dusa Post Ending 03|Dusa|Look, Prince, {#DialogueItalicFormat}um{#PreviousFormat}... your father's always been a pretty scary god. And, this is something between you and him.

DusaGift06|Dusa Gift 06|Zagreus|Please, it's yours! Besides, you must have some time off coming up when you can enjoy it, don't you?
DusaGift06|Dusa Gift 06|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}! I mean, maybe I do? I think maybe I do, except, nobody's told me anything about that, and besides, there's so much work to do around the House still, I just can't leave everything like this!!

DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Zagreus|Ambrosia isn't only for the gods, you know, Dusa. It's for anyone we really care about. So, here. Please, enjoy this, or... just add it to the lounge's stash. Whatever suits you.
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, I, but, you... really mean that, huh...? But, you're the Prince himself, and I'm just... look, we both know I am just a floating monster head. And a custodian. I just don't understand. Why keep on being nice to me, like this? I thought you'd never even talk to me...
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Zagreus|You're so much more than what you said. I wish you could see that. If only everybody in this House had your spirit.
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Dusa|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}. If only everybody in this House had yours, Prince Zagreus. You've been so kind to me, and I'm glad we've had a chance to get to know each other more. It's really nice, sometimes... knowing somebody really cares about me here?
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Zagreus|It should be more than sometimes that you feel that way, as far as I'm concerned. I just... I've never met anybody like you before. My father always told me not to smile quite as much, but... you're like me.
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Dusa|What, because I smile, {#DialogueItalicFormat}haha{#PreviousFormat}? Smiling's just a little something that I like to do to deal with the day! Though, oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}that's {#PreviousFormat}what you meant, I... oh, I see. I, look, this is kind of a lot, I, I had better go...! I'll cherish the Ambrosia, though, OK?!

DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|I got you more Ambrosia, Dusa, and I hope this is OK. I figure maybe you could use this for the lounge? Special events, guests, that sort of thing?
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|...I'm sorry that I flew away last time you brought me something like this, Prince... I mean, Zagreus. It's really strange for me to call you that, I... when I started here, they told me not to even speak with you, and now, {#DialogueItalicFormat}uh{#PreviousFormat}... here we are...!
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|Well, look, if I listened to everything I was told, my life would be a lot different and a lot worse off, I think! So... who cares what anybody says? I enjoy your company.
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|And I enjoy yours, too! Wasn't long ago that I was just a lonely gorgon head, all by myself in the big Underworld, looking for steady work. And then, I heard about the opening here, in your father's House? Well I got it! It seemed too good to be real. And then, there was you...
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|I remember when we first met. You were carrying three bowls for Cerberus and bumped right into me. It all went flying, but you cleaned up half of it before it hit the ground. Then flew away before I got your name. I thought I'd never see you again.
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|I was {#DialogueItalicFormat}so {#PreviousFormat}embarrassed! Worse... I thought I was done for, here. But, I got another chance! That was your doing, wasn't it? You've been looking out for me, all this time! That's so sweet of you, I... I don't know how to thank you, I... I, I better put this Ambrosia away, for safe keeping, OK?

DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|And I enjoy yours, too! Wasn't long ago that I was just a lonely gorgon head, all by myself in the big Underworld, looking for steady work. And then, I heard about the opening here, in your father's House? Well I got it! It seemed too good to be real. And then, there was you...
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|I remember when we first met. You were carrying three bowls for Cerberus and bumped right into me. It all went flying, but you cleaned up half of it before it hit the ground. Then flew away before I got your name. I thought I'd never see you again.
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|I was {#DialogueItalicFormat}so {#PreviousFormat}embarrassed! Worse... I thought I was done for, here. But, I got another chance! That was your doing, wasn't it? You've been looking out for me, all this time! That's so sweet of you, I... I don't know how to thank you, I... I, I better put this Ambrosia away, for safe keeping, OK?
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|I got you more Ambrosia, Dusa, and I hope this is OK. I figure maybe you could use this for the lounge? Special events, guests, that sort of thing?
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|...I'm sorry that I flew away last time you brought me something like this, Prince... I mean, Zagreus. It's really strange for me to call you that, I... when I started here, they told me not to even speak with you, and now, {#DialogueItalicFormat}uh{#PreviousFormat}... here we are...!
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|Well, look, if I listened to everything I was told, my life would be a lot different and a lot worse off, I think! So... who cares what anybody says? I enjoy your company.
