|"''Erm'', Dusa? Turns out that I may be stopping back from time to time, like this. But, please don't bother picking up my room. I won't be staying long."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, ''hahaha'', sure! But I'll just keep an eye on things in there, from time to time, in case you change your mind, um, so, good-bye!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Misc Meeting 03
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Um'', Prince? Your father, I, I think he's pretty steamed right now, about something, so, maybe you could stay away from him? Or... I could tell him you're not here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's quite all right, Dusa. I'm not afraid of him, and neither should you be. You're the best help he's ever found."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Just, ''ah'', just doing my job, here, Prince...!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Misc Meeting 04
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, ''um'', so, hi Prince! So, is there anything I can get you, or maybe tidy up some more, or... I just thought maybe you'd like something to drink? Sometime?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Oh''! A drink sometime sounds wonderful, Dusa, maybe tomorrow assuming I'm not getting out of here by then...?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Whaa'', I mean, it's no big deal, I mean, forget I asked, or anything, I'm sorry, bye!"
|-

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Uh, ''um'', I just, wanted to apologize, because, I think maybe I didn't act very appropriately last time you spoke to me? But I just really, really like this job, and promise I will always do my very best, so, I just hope I'll have another chance?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Dusa, please, there's no need to apologize! You've been doing a wonderful job, really!"

|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Date 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Ms. Dusa, I wanted to, ''uh'', cordially invite you to an outing in the lounge? Remember when you asked me about a drink?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Aaah! ''Oh, oh, oh, really, what you mean, right now, you're... I... I guess I'm overdue to take a break..."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"...And, well, since I don't exactly fit the mold of your traditional gorgon, I mean, I have no body for example, I had trouble finding work! That is until Lord Hades took me in, and then, I met you, and, well, I just love this job!!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Oh''! I can definitely relate at least to some of that."
|-

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Um'', P-Prince, the way you look so sad sometimes, when you come back in here, out of the Pool of Styx? Is everything OK? Because if there was something I could do..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, it's nothing for you to be concerned about, Dusa. I'm just having a harder time fighting my blasted way out of this place than I anticipated. If you'll excuse my language."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Oh'', I... this is silly, but, I'd no idea anybody could beat ''you'', I mean, the Prince? Greater than the mighty Achilles, more cunning than his father, faster than Hermes! But... you're just struggling, like me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I am. And that stuff you heard about me isn't true."
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 01
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"...sorted the cutlery, wiped the counters, replaced the candles, did the dishes, swept the floor, inspected the barrels, let's see what else, ''oh''!! The Prince, it's you!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's me! Dusa, I'm impressed you're able to manage this whole lounge all by yourself. How do you do it, what's your secret?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Hahaha'', secret? I'm two weeks behind schedule with this place, at least! Fortunately, no one here seems very good at keeping time, so, no one's gotten on my case just yet, but... oh, you aren't going to tell, are you?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Of course not. What's behind schedule, though? This place doesn't seem any worse for wear than usual."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Well, that's just it! Miss Nyx, she tasked me with a pretty big project a while back, to make this place ''worthy of the name'', which means... there's so much left to do, I need to get everything ready, please, excuse me, Prince!"
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Dusa, wait, before you fly away... there must be something I can do, to help pitch in with everything? Doesn't matter how good you are at your job, what you're describing, that's more than one individual can handle!"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Your Highness, please! I know you mean well, but I have this! Wish everybody wouldn't doubt me all the time, like that House Contractor, just gets to stand around, waiting for work orders! Unless they come from me, then ''nooo''."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"The House Contractor isn't cooperating with you, huh. No wonder so many lounge renovations are clogged up in the works. Though maybe I can grease the wheels a bit?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''AAH'', I completely forgot!! I need to get more cooking grease for the Head Chef! I have to go!!"

|-

|"''Ooh'', that might be my fault. I've been giving the Contractor lots of work. Some of those lounge orders must be coming from you, right? This place is really shaping up!"
|-

|-
|'''Dusa'''

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Um'', Prince Zagreus...? I just wanted to say something, if you have a little time? I know you're really busy... I can come back."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, no, now's fine, of course, what is it, Dusa? I'm not so busy, by the way, and always happy to check in. Wait, is something wrong?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"No, ''nononono'', it is just the opposite, I... can't believe you helped me, with the lounge. I don't think ''anyone ''has ''ever ''helped me out like you did, cleaning up after Cerberus, and the new rug, and the kitchen, and, just, all of this!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It was my pleasure, really. All of us use the lounge, don't we? This House can really be a lot, but in the lounge here, things are easier a bit, I think. I'm so glad we have you watching over it."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Y, you really mean that, Prince...? But you don't know what this means to me. I'm finally caught up on work! W, what am I going to do? I, I don't know what I'm going to do with all this extra time! I have to go, and plan everything out!!"
|-

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Um'', Zagreus? I wanted to talk some more, if you're available? I mean, if you're free. I mean! If you have time to right now. Is that OK?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Of course, Dusa! Where should we chat? The lounge, or maybe somewhere more private...?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Somewhere more private, please, if that's OK? Thank you."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"...Um, Zagreus... so, ever since you told me you had feelings for me, it's been, like... my whole mind is on fire. I haven't been able to think straight, or get anything done. It's all been so much!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sorry, Dusa, I... put a lot on you, and... maybe I shouldn't have, since I'm the Prince and everything, as you point out, and... sometimes, I forget myself. I'd never pressure you, it's just... I thought you had these feelings for me, too."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I ''do ''have feelings for you, silly! That's what I've been trying to tell you, it's just... it's just..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's just what...? Whatever it is, it's OK. You can be yourself with me, Dusa, I promise."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I'm glad you put it that way. I... I'm not looking for an intimate relationship. You're the kindest soul in this whole House. And I have learned so much from you! But, when I really think about my feelings... I'm just, not attracted to you, in that way. I'm sorry. You're a really nice guy!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, ''hahaha'', look, there's nothing to apologize for, not at all. In fact... all this is a relief. I've learned a lot from you, too, and I cherish our friendship for what it is. Do you... do you think that we could still be friends? Or, is it better that you didn't see me anymore...?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Don't say ''that''! Though, I was going to ask you the same thing. I'd really like it if you'd be my friend! Though, my career comes first, so... I don't want you doing any special favors, promise me? I need to see how far I can get on my own."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I respect that so much, and yes, I promise, Dusa. So, well, then... friends? For all eternity?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Yes. Friends. For all eternity. Now... I had better go. See you, OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 01
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Hey, Zagreus, I... wanted to talk to you again, I... what I mean is, I just, hope I didn't hurt your feelings, because, if I did, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Dusa, please! Remember ''friends for all eternity''? That's a long time, so, there's no need for second guessing. I'm glad we had a chance to talk."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, well, good! That's a relief to hear, but... one last thing, so I can clear my conscience of it, I... I've saved all the Ambrosia that you gave me, and I figured since... I didn't realize, you know, the way you felt? I can be a little dense! I have it here. And I would like to give it back. Is that OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 02
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Hey, ''um'', Zagreus? I wanted to say, that was very sweet of you, letting me hang onto all that Ambrosia you gave me before? It's in safe keeping now! Except one bottle... that kind of slipped, and broke. Though that did mean I got to try the stuff!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, you got to try it, after all? What did you think, all it's cracked up to be?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"It was a''maz''ing. I've never had anything like it! It's so good to have a forked tongue, meant I could taste it twice at the same time! So, um... if one of the other bottles slipped and broke... you wouldn't mind, would you?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Dusa, I can't shake this feeling, so I wanted to apologize to you, because... I think when we first met, I just... I don't think I took it the right way. I never had a fan before! I wanted to live up to your idea of me."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, Prince, Zagreus, don't worry about that! Even I didn't know what I was going through. When I first started working here, I was just ''so ''impressed with you, I mean... you were the only one who would stand up to your father! I thought about you all the time!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But you didn't even know me, yet. We didn't get to talking for what seemed like ages. You can be difficult to find! Since I can't fly up to the rafters like you can."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Well I'm so glad you kept trying to talk to me! If you hadn't... I'd probably be up in the rafters still, building up this idea of you that's not even as good as the real thing!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Love 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Dusa, something I was wondering, and it's just curiosity, mind you, but... is there somebody else...? I mean, somebody special, whom you're close with, or would like to be. Romantically, I mean. If it's all right to ask."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, you can ask me anything! But, ''um'', somebody else romantically, not really, no? It's not really my thing? It doesn't mean I don't have feelings for you, though! You know that, right? I wouldn't drop what I'm doing and throw myself at danger for just anyone, you know!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I definitely know. There's seven kinds of love, or so, isn't that right? It isn't something that's taught extensively down here, though, so... there's still a lot for me to learn, I guess."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Wow, I never thought of it as ''love ''until you said it there just now, Prince, but you're right! I love you, Zagreus! ''Hah, haha'', that feels good to come right out and say, you know? OK, well, bye!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Cerberus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I hope it's not been too much, having to care for Cerberus, is it, Dusa? He isn't quite as fearsome as he seems. At least, that goes for two heads out of three!"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, Cerberus is a good boy, he's fine! One of the highlights of the job, for sure. We really hit it off after he finally realized I'm not a ball! So, I've been feeding him, grooming him, changing his water dish..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...Cleaning up after him...?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Most definitely, yes. If you'll excuse me, by the way? He's got to go. I mean! I've got to go! I mean!! You know what I mean, bye!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Pressure 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Ungh'', Dusa... it's a little much out there sometimes, I have to say. Different stresses than in here, but still."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh don't you lose hope now, Prince Zagreus! There isn't anything you couldn't handle, I just know! You're every bit as tough as your father, except, you're nice! And you never back down from anything. You can do this!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...I don't know that anyone can do this. No escape from the Underworld and all that. Though, thanks for cheering me up."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I'm not just saying it, I mean it, Prince! Look at how far you've come! Practically everybody in this House believes in you! Even the Wretched Broker and the Head Chef! Oh, I've asked them! Everybody thinks you're going to succeed!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Pressure 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Can I ask you a couple of purely figurative questions here, Dusa? First, what have I gotten myself into...? And second, what am I going to do...?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Believe me, I know the feeling, being in over my head! Though, if I can find my way out of my messes, then I know, I ''know'', you definitely can! I don't know what you ought to do, but I am always here to listen."
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Achilles 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know Achilles reasonably well, don't you, Dusa? Seems like he's always stuck there in that hall. At least you get to fly around. Sometimes I think he wishes he was someplace else."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"There has to be a way to help him, Prince! He's been so loyal to this House, and he has to be your truest friend of everybody here. But he's the pity-party type. He needs someone to get him out of this!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, Prince, I heard the news about Master Achilles, that's so great! I'm going to miss him being here as often as he used to, but I'm just so happy for him, and for you!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Me too, Dusa. The happy-for-him part, at any rate! He's a good friend, and he deserved much better than to be stuck here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Gorgons 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Ms. Dusa, I ran into hostile gorgons that resembled you out there in Asphodel. Resembled only in the vaguest sense, I mean, they lacked your charm or social graces, anyway. I just, hope you are not related, since I sort of... you know."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, ''hahaha'', those old things? They're relatives just in the loosest sense, like... say you had some nasty, almost mindless siblings born entirely from your own blood, something like that? Do you have any idea how hard it was to get a steady job because of them?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So I have your permission to continue hacking down such gorgons with impunity?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Gorgons 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I had another question about your relationship to other gorgons, Dusa. So... I notice you're not much for hissing, snakelike noises when you speak, and so on? Is that some sort of special gorgon language or something?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"No, ''um'', not exactly, Prince! It's what it sounds like, ''hrrrsssss''!! Just, scary hissing, really, takes some practice not to sound like that with a forked tongue! I really wanted to fit in. Hey, how about you? Always wondered how come you have a surface accent. Weren't you born here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, wait, me? I never gave it any thought. I... guess it's from my father. He insisted that he teach me how to speak, himself. Maybe it's in the blood."
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Gorgons 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Dusa, this is kind of personal, and you don't have to answer, but I have to know. So... did you... use to have a body, and all that? Because, I've heard of gorgons, well... that you had wings, and such?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Um'', Prince, so, look. That's something very private that you're asking, and... I know you don't mean any harm, but it just isn't something I discuss with anyone, OK? I'm who I am. Besides! As you can see, I don't need wings to fly!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Gorgons 03 Aftermath 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Ms. Dusa, I, ''erm'', wanted to apologize for when I pried about your past. I just wanted to get to know you better, but... I was insensitive, and I'm sorry."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, Your Highness, Zagreus, come on! Don't even worry about it! I'd already forgotten, really no big deal. It's just, the past me, it's as though... it wasn't even me. This is me, now! I'm glad I'm here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa About Gorgons 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, it must be pretty handy, being able to turn somebody into stone. Is that something you can just do whenever you please, like... I don't know, sticking out your tongue or something?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Not quite as easy as all that, but not so hard! You have to get yourself pretty worked up, and picture what you're seeing like a... well, um, like a picture, really, and then, ''fwoop''! Stone statue. It's funny, I used to think everybody could do it!"

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Mister Hypnos, I have trouble getting through to him, I think? He gives me plenty of advice, it's just, it isn't really why I talk to him. I... only talk to him when I don't have a lot of other choice, I guess."

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Oh''! Not really, um, because, my work is in the House itself, and, well, the courtyard, technically, it's kind of right outside, so, I'm supposed to stay inside the walls. But, I think I know who you mean! I've seen him, standing there just past your chamber doors. Why, is he OK?"

|"Oh! Well, most of it isn't so bad at all, but... ever since Cerberus tore up the lounge, I... guess it's been a little hectic, getting everything back to normal like before!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm not sure it was ever normal around here, but... I'm sorry I created work for you. Cerberus tore the place apart because of me. Though, maybe I can help you patch things up?"

|"''Haha'', oh, uh, no, it's just, ''uhh''... I'm really, really, really sorry, I can't help it, I, ''um'', didn't want to interrupt, because, I kind of knew all that, already? Um, meaning, I had heard about it, everybody talks, you know, from time to time? But I just... really hope you find her soon!"

|-

|"''Ah'', Prince, no, it isn't you, it's definitely me! There's all these things she said I need to work on, calmness, not making so many lists, putting things into perspective, not working myself too hard, not taking blame for things that aren't my fault...!"

|-

|"I asked you how you did it, got the traffic flow moving a little faster, and... it's the sarcophagus things, isn't it? Right down the hall! The shades, they're scared to stand around! That's brilliant, Mister Hypnos, I'm impressed!"

You are not the sole bearer of this House's fate. Your temperament toward your work is as important as the end result. Now then... I would ask that you return to your post."

|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, you said it all! Don't mean to put you on the spot or anything. I'm just glad we've had a chance to get to know each other."
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Gift 06
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Dusa? Here's some more of this really, really good Nectar for you! Please keep up the wonderful work, and more importantly, keep being your wonderful self."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I, I, I, I'm really very flattered, Prince, but, I've just been so busy, lately, that I haven't even had a chance to try the last bottle you gave me, so... you want this back, maybe for someone else?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Please, it's yours! Besides, you must have some time off coming up when you can enjoy it, don't you?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Oh''! I mean, maybe I do? I think maybe I do, except, nobody's told me anything about that, and besides, there's so much work to do around the House still, I just can't leave everything like this!!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Gift 07
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Dusa? Congratulations on completing your assignment with the lounge. Look at this place! It's better than ever. All thanks to your effort and dedication. Here, this is for you. Something special for the occasion."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Whoa'', I, this, this is ''Ambrosia'', Prince! But, this is for ''gods''...! This isn't for... someone like me? But, wait, wait wait, no, here, I'm going to do it, I am going to do it, here, take ''this''!! I got it, just for you, so, take it, please! Farewell!!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Gift 08
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Ambrosia isn't only for the gods, you know, Dusa. It's for anyone we really care about. So, here. Please, enjoy this, or... just add it to the lounge's stash. Whatever suits you."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Oh'', I, but, you... really mean that, huh...? But, you're the Prince himself, and I'm just... look, we both know I am just a floating monster head. And a custodian. I just don't understand. Why keep on being nice to me, like this? I thought you'd never even talk to me..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're so much more than what you said. I wish you could see that. If only everybody in this House had your spirit."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Ah''. If only everybody in this House had yours, Prince Zagreus. You've been so kind to me, and I'm glad we've had a chance to get to know each other more. It's really nice, sometimes... knowing somebody really cares about me here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It should be more than sometimes that you feel that way, as far as I'm concerned. I just... I've never met anybody like you before. My father always told me not to smile quite as much, but... you're like me."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"What, because I smile, ''haha''? Smiling's just a little something that I like to do to deal with the day! Though, oh, ''that's ''what you meant, I... oh, I see. I, look, this is kind of a lot, I, I had better go...! I'll cherish the Ambrosia, though, OK?!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Gift 09
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I got you more Ambrosia, Dusa, and I hope this is OK. I figure maybe you could use this for the lounge? Special events, guests, that sort of thing?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"...I'm sorry that I flew away last time you brought me something like this, Prince... I mean, Zagreus. It's really strange for me to call you that, I... when I started here, they told me not to even speak with you, and now, ''uh''... here we are...!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, look, if I listened to everything I was told, my life would be a lot different and a lot worse off, I think! So... who cares what anybody says? I enjoy your company."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"And I enjoy yours, too! Wasn't long ago that I was just a lonely gorgon head, all by myself in the big Underworld, looking for steady work. And then, I heard about the opening here, in your father's House? Well I got it! It seemed too good to be real. And then, there was you..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I remember when we first met. You were carrying three bowls for Cerberus and bumped right into me. It all went flying, but you cleaned up half of it before it hit the ground. Then flew away before I got your name. I thought I'd never see you again."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I was ''so ''embarrassed! Worse... I thought I was done for, here. But, I got another chance! That was your doing, wasn't it? You've been looking out for me, all this time! That's so sweet of you, I... I don't know how to thank you, I... I, I better put this Ambrosia away, for safe keeping, OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Gift 10
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Dusa, I was thinking that this batch of Ambrosia ought to hold the lounge over for quite a while! Keep things livelier for everyone. And, please take a bottle for yourself, won't you? As a token of my affection."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Oh''! Y-you said your ''affection'', huh, I... wow! I... really like you, also, Zagreus. I liked you from the start! You were so different from your father, and Miss Nyx, I could just tell, but... wait, what am I saying, I am such a dummy! You're just being friendly with me, right...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I would be more than that, if it pleased you. You're very wonderful, and... you light up this House. But I would never risk our friendship, so, if this is where we draw the boundary, please, just let me know."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Um''... wait, wait. Wait, wait. Did you just say I'm... ''wonderful''?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I did, indeed. And I am glad to get it off my chest, if you must know! Though... what about you? How do you feel?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I, ''wow'', I, I never thought you'd... have those kinds of feelings, for somebody like me. It's really nice to hear! It makes me feel complete. But, ''um'', Zagreus, I don't know if I can be what you need, I mean? Wait. You weren't, you weren't just being nice to me for all this time, because...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''What''? No, no, Dusa, of course not, I... ''ungh'', why is it so damn difficult to share one's feelings with somebody else? I don't want to ruin what we have. If only you could see what's in my heart."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, ''hahaha'', I was just checking, don't feel bad, OK? You don't seem capable of hiding what's in your heart. And I mean that in the best possible way. I'm so happy, it's just... all this is a lot, and, I'm on duty right now, but... see you soon...?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Gift 05
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh no, no no no, Your Highness, are you, really giving this to me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes, yes I am, Ms. Dusa, and I hope you enjoy it. Be seeing you, OK?"
