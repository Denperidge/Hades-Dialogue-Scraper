MegaeraWithSisyphus01|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (1)|Megaera|...You help him out again, you'll get a thousand lashes next we meet. And when I return, this little rock of yours had better be up there rather than here, or else you'll get a thousand more.
MegaeraWithSisyphus01|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (1)|Sisyphus|Sounds good, sounds good, Madam, that's more than equitable really, I'll hold you to that! Be seeing you around!
MegaeraWithSisyphus02|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Megaera|...And you'll keep busy with your boulder if you know what's good for you, you little cheat. Don't go thinking I'm not watching you.
MegaeraWithSisyphus02|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|I appreciate your vigilance, Madam, and surely I'll be getting Bouldy up this very hill in no time flat, despite the fact that I have never once achieved this!
MegaeraWithSisyphus03|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Megaera|...And when this matter with the Prince is over with, we will be getting back to how things used to be. Until such time, I'd better regularly see your boulder on that hill.
MegaeraWithSisyphus03|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Entirely makes sense to me, Madam, and rest assured that Bouldy, *erm*, that is to say this boulder here, that I will push it regularly, moving forward, same as ever! Now good-bye!
ThanatosWithSisyphus01|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Thanatos|...And, lastly, you're forbidden from offering further assistance to Prince Zagreus. Do we understand each other?
ThanatosWithSisyphus01|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Sisyphus|Why, absolutely, Master Thanatos, I wouldn't think of it! My mind is fully occupied with all the latest boulder-pushing strategies, besides.
ThanatosWithSisyphus01|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Thanatos|Enough! Get back to work, and I'll get back to mine.
ThanatosWithSisyphus02|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|I understand you, Master Thanatos, and will be doing as you say. No more assistance for Prince Zagreus, dead serious this time.
ThanatosWithSisyphus02|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (2)|Thanatos|Good. It shall be both our skins if you are caught in one of your deceptions. See to it that this doesn't happen.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Thanatos|...You would be wise to heed my words next time, and fear the consequences of eluding me. Death can be most unpleasant, as I'm sure you know.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Well, that's just it, Master Thanatos. I never was terribly fearful of you gods, if you'll forgive my saying so. Far as I can tell, all of you seem to have your struggles much like mortals do. A fear of death aside.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Thanatos|What would you know of the struggles of gods? Now you have eternity to think on what you've done. Maybe I'll check again with you after another aeon or two, see if you've learned anything more.
SisyphusFirstMeeting|Sisyphus First Meeting|Sisyphus|Hey, Prince Z. Must look like I'm slacking off with the old boulder, here, but... I was just getting back on my feet. The Fury Sisters don't often leave me be. Where'd they go, anyway? And... what are you doing here?
SisyphusFirstMeeting|Sisyphus First Meeting|Zagreus|Oh, you know, just out on a little stroll is all. Do me a favor, though, you see the Fury Sisters, let them know I was headed down the way I came from, will you...?
SisyphusFirstMeeting|Sisyphus First Meeting|Sisyphus|Oh I'll let them know, all right, I hear you loud and clear, Your Highness. I'll just go about my business now, and you take care.
SisyphusMeeting02_A|Sisyphus Meeting 02 A|Sisyphus|You know, Prince Z., I'd not expected to run into you again, not after all this time. Something amiss down in the House, or what? Not had much company of late, is all.
SisyphusMeeting02_A|Sisyphus Meeting 02 A|Zagreus|Oh, something's just about always amiss back home, sir. Figured it couldn't hurt to check up on things in Tartarus a bit more frequently.
SisyphusMeeting02_A|Sisyphus Meeting 02 A|Sisyphus|Well I am grateful for it, I and the old boulder there, in turn. I'm used to going lengthy stretches on my own, but having visitors from time to time would do me well!
SisyphusMeeting02|Sisyphus Meeting 02|Sisyphus|If I may be so bold, Your Highness, I was wondering... what brings you back around this way again? Same story as last time?
SisyphusMeeting02|Sisyphus Meeting 02|Zagreus|Look, I have to level with you, Sisyphus. I'm leaving the House. I've had quite enough. You understand, I'm sure. I'm going to the surface.
SisyphusMeeting02|Sisyphus Meeting 02|Sisyphus|*Whew*, that is quite an undertaking, Prince. If it wasn't you yourself proposing it, I'd like to call it madness, truth be told. Though you're just mad enough to pull it off! Well hey, I hope you make it. Good fortune out there!
SisyphusMeeting03|Sisyphus Meeting 03|Sisyphus|Hey Prince how goes the old escape plan, any luck?
SisyphusMeeting03|Sisyphus Meeting 03|Zagreus|You know it's been all right, all things considered. Dying now and then, and it's been hard, but hey, what can you do.
SisyphusMeeting03|Sisyphus Meeting 03|Sisyphus|Ah, well, keep your chin up. Me, why I quit trying to get out of here a while back, but, if I was a fire-stepping youngster like yourself, perhaps I would have stuck to it.
SisyphusMeeting04|Sisyphus Meeting 04|Sisyphus|Hey, Your Highness, anything the matter, or just passing through? Happy that we get to chat like this of late, of course.
SisyphusMeeting04|Sisyphus Meeting 04|Zagreus|Sisyphus, don't take this the wrong way, but... why are you helping me? My father's stuck you here for an eternity of torment and even still, you greet me with a smile, time after time.
SisyphusMeeting04|Sisyphus Meeting 04|Sisyphus|*Hah*! Come now, Prince Z., that's just the way I am! Besides, you're not your father, thank the gods! You always seemed a decent lad to me, and if you're saying you want out of here, why, I suppose I can relate, is all.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutFury01|Sisyphus Meeting About Fury 01|Sisyphus|You know, Prince, it's been good not having to see those Fury Sisters quite as much lately. The main one, what's her name, she's on your case now, isn't she.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutFury01|Sisyphus Meeting About Fury 01|Zagreus|You mean Megaera. She's on my case all right. Under strict orders not to let me out of Tartarus. I guess that means you've got yourself a break! About damn time they gave one to you, sir.
SisyphusMeeting05|Sisyphus Meeting 05|Zagreus|Hey, quick question, Sisyphus, you seen the other Fury Sisters lately?
SisyphusMeeting05|Sisyphus Meeting 05|Sisyphus|Not seen the other Fury Sisters in some time now that you mention it! Just Megaera, the kindly one, and she is quite a handful on her own. I'll keep an eye out for the other two!
SisyphusMeeting06|Sisyphus Meeting 06|Zagreus|Sisyphus, how can you stand it, being here like this? You always seem in such good spirits, though.
SisyphusMeeting06|Sisyphus Meeting 06|Sisyphus|You push old Bouldy here sufficient times, and you might get a different outlook on things, too. With the Furies all preoccupied and with my running into you from time to time, I'm positively doing great lately. I like to take what pleasures I can get!
SisyphusMeeting07|Sisyphus Meeting 07|Sisyphus|Look here, Bouldy, Prince Z. himself has come to visit us!
SisyphusMeeting07|Sisyphus Meeting 07|Zagreus|Does Bouldy really keep you company? Personally I would resent a giant boulder that keeps tumbling back down a hill after I push it all the way up there.
SisyphusMeeting07|Sisyphus Meeting 07|Sisyphus|Oh, Bouldy's not so bad, I mean, he's a good listener, a good shoulder to lean on, doesn't wield a whip... I rightly can't complain! Good having company down here.
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Zagreus|You know I was just thinking, sir... sometimes I am a little envious of you and Bouldy there. You seem to have things pretty figured out. I still grow frustrated with myself quite often and don't always know whom to turn to.
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Sisyphus|Oh, *hah*! Well, I just think you're in a tough spot lately, Prince. But you'll get through! As for old Bouldy, why, by all means do not hesitate to lay your troubles on him if you like! Dumped all of mine on him a while back.
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Zagreus|So I can just... walk up and talk to him, and chat? That's all it takes?
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Sisyphus|That's truly all it takes to make a friend sometimes, indeed, Highness. Now, here.
SisyphusAboutBouldy02|Sisyphus About Bouldy 02|Zagreus|I have to thank you, Sisyphus, not just for all the help you've given me time after time, but for encouraging me to have a chat with Bouldy there. I daresay I feel a little more at peace of late, and maybe it's thanks to him.
SisyphusAboutBouldy02|Sisyphus About Bouldy 02|Sisyphus|He's a good one, all right, isn't he? Though if you've come to such an understanding with old Bouldy there, why, it must mean you've done some growing on your own as well, I think.
SisyphusAboutBouldy03|Sisyphus About Bouldy 03|Sisyphus|Hey, Your Highness, good, old Bouldy there had several things he wanted to tell you.
SisyphusAboutBouldy04|Sisyphus About Bouldy 04|Sisyphus|Hey Prince, ah, so... you do know Bouldy's just a plain old rock with a few lines chiseled into him, resembling a face, don't you? Chiseled into *it*, I mean. Just so you don't get the wrong idea...
SisyphusAboutAlecto01|Sisyphus About Alecto 01|Zagreus|You ever meet Alecto, Sisyphus? The Fury Megaera's nastier sister. We recently became acquainted, she and I.
SisyphusAboutAlecto01|Sisyphus About Alecto 01|Sisyphus|Ah, fortunately I've not seen too much of her, myself, Prince Z. And based on everything that I have seen and heard, I'd like to keep it that way for a while! I hope she doesn't cause you too much trouble there.
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, have you had run-ins with Tisiphone the Fury here before? She isn't much for conversation, I don't think.
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Sisyphus|Tisiphone. Why, yes, I have, in fact, Prince Z. She's visited on multiple occasions, truth be told. So she is back, is she?
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Zagreus|She is. Although, I think she's back to deal with me. I'll have to keep her plenty busy just in case.
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Sisyphus|Appreciate it, Prince. Of all the Fury Sisters, she's the one I would least care to see. But if she does stop by, you know, that's how it goes.
SisyphusMeeting08|Sisyphus Meeting 08|Sisyphus|Look, Prince, I don't hold grudges, you know that. Push this boulder long as I have, you move past the petty stuff. So, just want you to know, in case you make it out this time, it's been a real pleasure.
SisyphusMeeting08|Sisyphus Meeting 08|Zagreus|Feeling's mutual, sir. Someday you'll have to tell me all about how you tricked Father. I might learn a thing or two.
SisyphusBackstory01|Sisyphus Backstory 01|Sisyphus|Say, tell me something, Prince, if you don't mind. How come you're so intent on getting out of here? I mean, what happens when you do?
SisyphusBackstory01|Sisyphus Backstory 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, you ever lose somebody dear to you? There's someone out there whom I need to find. That's... all that I can say right now.
SisyphusBackstory01|Sisyphus Backstory 01|Sisyphus|I get it, Highness, and I didn't mean to pry, it's just... I can't remember what it's like to want something so bad, you know? Whoever's out there, I hope you find them soon.
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Zagreus|Hey sir, I've always wondered, what were you like back when you were alive? Were you always this wise?
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Sisyphus|Might surprise you, Highness, I've a bit of royalty in me, myself. Not on your level, mind, but I was very much a king. Though I'll be honest, I... I wasn't much of a good man.
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Zagreus|*Huh*! I thought I sensed the royalty in you! Although, I can't imagine you as anything besides the gentleman I know you for, my friend.
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Sisyphus|Well that is awful kind of you to say. Though, I would like to think my punishment here wasn't without warrant. At least I've had a lot of time to think it through!
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Zagreus|*Erm*, Sisyphus, you mind my asking what you did to warrant this particular arrangement you've got here? Pushing a boulder till the end of time and all. Never heard it in your own words.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Sisyphus|Well, it's a bit of a long story, Prince. My time had come, though I just wasn't ready, you might say. Your father thought he had me in his clutches, but then, *shoom*! I gave him the slip. Your father's henchman, Thanatos, he'll back me up on that.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Zagreus|Outsmarted Thanatos, that's amazing... what happened then?
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Sisyphus|Turns out your father doesn't like us mortals cheating death. Eventually they found me, so, now I'm stuck here with my boulder friend. I push old Bouldy up the hill to the beat of the Furies' whips, then he tumbles down, and then we go again.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Zagreus|So then, you're stuck forever, no reprieve. That's terrible... wish there was something I could do to help.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Sisyphus|You save those sympathies for someone else, Your Highness! I could be Prometheus, spending an eternity having my liver gobbled up, but instead I get to stay in shape, and have these chats with you. Now I'd better get back to it!
SisyphusBackstory04|Sisyphus Backstory 04|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I've meant to ask, where are you getting all this stuff you give to me? You must be pretty well connected around here.
SisyphusBackstory04|Sisyphus Backstory 04|Sisyphus|Oh, well, you know! I have acquaintances amongst the locals here, try to be neighborly with everyone is all. It's not just Bouldy and myself as you can see. Sometimes I come across things that'd be better off in other hands than mine.
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Zagreus|I have to tell you, Sisyphus. Sometimes I wish I knew more about your past. You must have been a great king.
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Sisyphus|Well, *ah-hah*, the thing is that I wasn't, Highness. And that's not modesty from me, all right? All behind me, now. And I'd appreciate it if we left it at that.
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Zagreus|I hear you, sir. Though, whatever you did in your mortal days... you've since more than paid for it, I'm sure.... Wait, is that why you're still here, in Tartarus? Because you think you deserve this?
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Sisyphus|It's more like... this is where I belong. Where my path has taken me, you know? Here in the Underworld, you can't entirely escape your past... and yet, it's like you get another life to live. With all the wisdom that you picked up along the way.
SisyphusBackstory06|Sisyphus Backstory 06|Sisyphus|You know, Prince Z., you really have a look about you that you know exactly where you're going, as of late. I used to think you weren't near as comfortable in your own skin.
SisyphusBackstory06|Sisyphus Backstory 06|Zagreus|Oh, you were right. I was never comfortable performing Father's routine Tartarus inspections. Though those responsibilities of mine didn't last long.
SisyphusBackstory06|Sisyphus Backstory 06|Sisyphus|Nor did we have much opportunity to chat back then, but hey! You always struck me as a decent sort. Wasn't accustomed to your father's henchpeople greeting me with a smile.
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I know you tend to be in remarkably good spirits, all things considered, but there must be something I can do to help with your predicament, isn't there?
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Sisyphus|Oh, come now, Prince, do Bouldy and I look like we could use your charity? We're planning to stay put within this chamber for a while. It's hardly a predicament, I'd say.
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Zagreus|But, what of the Furies and their torments and all that? They might be back and make all this more difficult for you.
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Sisyphus|Ah, yes, the Fury Sisters, well. I wouldn't mind seeing them more infrequently now that you mention it, but either way! So don't you even worry about me. Now, here.
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Zagreus|I have good news, sir! I located the contract binding you, and bought it out. It's null and void. You're free to go!
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Sisyphus|Oh! Indeed, then, does this mean, Prince, then... the Fury Sisters, they won't come around as often anymore?
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Zagreus|Not just that, Sisyphus! You can make your way someplace else, where other decent shades reside! You know, somewhere with fewer chains and torture devices and such?
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Sisyphus|You're much too kind to this old soul, Prince Z. The thing is, this is home. For me and Bouldy, it is what it is. Though, knowing that the Furies won't be visiting with quite their former regularity, that is a load off. Heavier than Bouldy, there.
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Zagreus|You mean you're really going to stay? Even though you don't have to?
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Sisyphus|Is that so odd, Highness? Don't see myself lugging old Bouldy out of here, besides! And if I were to leave, why, we would not be having these exchanges now and then. I happen to enjoy them quite a bit! Now, here you go, and thank you, very much.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 01|Sisyphus|Must say, Prince Z., the free life sure does have its perks down here! This place really isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 01|Zagreus|Glad to hear it, sir. But you're still here... the same as ever. Is it really all that different from the way it always was?
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 01|Sisyphus|Well, it used to be I'd have to start heaving Bouldy there at any point, if the Fury Sisters decided to show up. But now? I just get to relax, chat a bit with the other shades, and give you one of these when you're in the area!
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath02|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 02|Sisyphus|Ah, there you are, Prince! I was just thinking about how grateful I am that you got me out of that contract with your father. It's been a real weight off my shoulders, truth be told.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath02|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 02|Zagreus|You never seemed particularly concerned even before, sir. Must say you're very good at hiding your worries.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath02|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 02|Sisyphus|And I could say the same to you! Look, I know you were concerned for my wellbeing. Now you don't have to be. And I'll still be around to help you out. Good feeling, isn't it?
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath03|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 03|Sisyphus|You must have seen everything there is to see here in your father's Underworld, haven't you, Prince? I figure that there isn't any place nicer than this!
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath03|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 03|Zagreus|Oh! Well, I suppose now that you're free, you could always see for yourself? It's pretty different as soon as you reach Asphodel. Don't you have someplace or somebody you'd like to see?
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath03|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 03|Sisyphus|I'll take what's coming to me right here, thank you very much. You're the wayfaring sort, but my wayfaring days are over. It's hard to explain, but... this is a much-needed fresh start for me.
SisyphusHighRelationship01|Sisyphus High Relationship 01|Sisyphus|I will have you know, Prince, that your visits here have become a very important part of my routine!
SisyphusHighRelationship01|Sisyphus High Relationship 01|Zagreus|And what routine is that, exactly, sir?
SisyphusHighRelationship01|Sisyphus High Relationship 01|Sisyphus|Why, the routine of looking forward, of course! I try to appreciate the moment as much as anybody, but you know? It's always nice having something to look forward to. So, see you next time, then?
SisyphusMeeting_FuryVictorious01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Victorious 01|Sisyphus|I heard straight from the source the Fury Megaera's been giving you a time, there, hasn't she. Trust me I know the feeling, so, I'm grateful that you're here and that she's not. You give her hell for me next time, won't you?
SisyphusMeeting_FuryVictorious01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Victorious 01|Zagreus|Oh I'll get her for the both of us one of these days. Nights? Whenever.
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 01|Sisyphus|Hey Prince, I heard you showed that Fury Sister the what-for, is that the truth? Might explain why I've been left here to my own devices for a change.
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 01|Zagreus|I don't think she'll be out of commission for very long. She'd best find you minding that boulder, though at least you managed to catch a break for now. Be seeing you, Sisyphus.
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated02|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 02|Sisyphus|Now you be careful out there, Highness. The kindly Megaera is out for blood. She kept on groaning 'bout the last exchange between the two of you. You must have showed her good!
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated02|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 02|Zagreus|I think I might have gotten lucky.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Sisyphus|Hey, Prince Z., I heard the strangest rumor, here's the thing, I'll give it to you straight. I have heard you've been consorting both with Megaera the Fury and with that old stiff, Thanatos, can you believe it?
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I don't know where you heard that, but... it's true. They're... they're just doing their jobs, and I... I know how it looks, but... you're my friend, as well, and I don't want you to forget that.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Sisyphus|I... look, I do appreciate the sentiment, Your Highness, I'm just surprised. I thought we shared a common foe in them, is all. What can I say, I hope that someday I can see them how you see them.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Thank you for understanding, sir. Besides... maybe I can get them to cut you some slack.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I have to be up front with you. The Fury Megaera and Thanatos... I know you're not exactly on the best of terms with either one of them. But they're both close to me. You won't hold it against me, sir, will you?
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Sisyphus|Look, Prince, it's not for me to judge you, or your friends. The Fury Sisters, Master Thanatos... we got off on the wrong foot, you could say. My fault, entirely. I'd sooner make sure that our correspondence here doesn't make those relationships more difficult.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Zagreus|Don't even say that, sir. I think Meg and Than know me better than that by now. Well, thanks for understanding, as always.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Sisyphus|Certainly, Highness. And who knows? Perhaps as you spend more time together, some of your finer qualities will rub off on those two!
SisyphusAboutThanatosRelationship01|Sisyphus About Thanatos Relationship 01|Sisyphus|How goes it with old Master Thanatos of late, Prince Z.? Is he at least less stern with you than with the poor mortals he's sent to take in here?
SisyphusAboutThanatosRelationship01|Sisyphus About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|Oh, Thanatos is doing all right. Much like my father, I think he feels he has some sort of fearsome reputation to uphold. Or maybe he's perpetually stressed over his work. But he's been well lately.
SisyphusAboutThanatosRelationship01|Sisyphus About Thanatos Relationship 01|Sisyphus|That's good, I guess! Always appreciated that he ultimately took me in, rather than having to show up here through much more sudden, much more painful means. Didn't stop me from trying to avoid the trip, of course.
SisyphusRunProgress01|Sisyphus Run Progress 01|Sisyphus|Word is you've caused quite the hubbub in Elysium, Prince Z.! Making the champion up there really work for it, I hear?
SisyphusRunProgress01|Sisyphus Run Progress 01|Zagreus|You could say that, I guess! Apparently word gets around. That Theseus, though... he doesn't care for me one bit, let me tell you!
SisyphusRunProgress01|Sisyphus Run Progress 01|Sisyphus|I bet he'd like you better if you were a regular pushover! Ah, well, he'll learn, I'm sure.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Sisyphus|Prince, you've been gone for quite a while, why... I heard-tell you made it all the way outside! And I believed it for a while there, yet here you are. What happened, might I ask?
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|I made it out of here, indeed, sir. I always said that I was leaving, but... turns out there was good reason for me to come back. Not the least of which is visiting my friends from time to time.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Sisyphus|Well, I am certainly delighted to hear that! So long as you achieved what you set out to do. But, what brings you back again this way? More than a social visit I presume.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|You're right. I'm back because... I'm leaving once again. Something I have to do if I get up there, though I should be back before long either way, I guess.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Sisyphus|Going to try and make it out of here again and again, is it? Well they say repetition is the key to mastery, Prince Z. Now here, I'll send you on your way.
SisyphusRunCleared02|Sisyphus Run Cleared 02|Sisyphus|So, how do you like the surface, hey, Prince Z.? Now that you've finally had a chance to see it for yourself. Not too bad, I hope?
SisyphusRunCleared02|Sisyphus Run Cleared 02|Zagreus|It takes some getting used to, that's for sure. I'm not sure I'll ever grow completely accustomed to it. Do you miss it, sir?
SisyphusRunCleared02|Sisyphus Run Cleared 02|Sisyphus|Oh, you know. I still have almost everything that matters, and the rest? It makes for precious memories I didn't have up there.
SisyphusPostEnding01|Sisyphus Post Ending 01|Sisyphus|So, all this time, Prince, when you were battling up to the surface, and all that... you were searching for *her*, weren't you? The Queen?
SisyphusPostEnding01|Sisyphus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|I was. Although, between us, sir, it's important that you keep that one a secret, please. Did... you happen to meet her, ever?
SisyphusPostEnding01|Sisyphus Post Ending 01|Sisyphus|Well, just the one time, briefly, when your father decided to put me here. And, you have my word, of course. About the... surface stuff.
SisyphusPostEpilogue01|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 01|Sisyphus|Prince Z., my understanding is the Queen herself is back, is that correct? Moreover, I have heard a truly fascinating rumor about her...
SisyphusPostEpilogue01|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|That I'm her son...? It's true, sir. And she's back with us for now, indeed. I think we're all still getting used to it, but... it feels good, having her in my life.
SisyphusPostEpilogue01|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 01|Sisyphus|That's wonderful to hear. I'd always heard good things about that one. No wonder such a quality runs in the family.
SisyphusPostEpilogue02|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 02|Sisyphus|Just one thing I don't understand, Prince Z., if you'll indulge me for a moment, here. If everything is all right for you at the House, then... why is it you're fighting to the surface, still?
SisyphusPostEpilogue02|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|Oh, you know. Wouldn't want Father to get too comfortable thinking this place is foolproof. It has a terrifyingly ominous reputation to uphold! *There is no escape*.
SisyphusPostEpilogue02|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 02|Sisyphus|Sure, that makes sense! Well, from a certain point of view. Escape over and over to prove it can't be done! I like that. Well, let's both of us keep at it, then!
SisyphusPostEpilogue03|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 03|Sisyphus|Not working yourself *too *hard of late, are you, Prince Z.? Remembering to take some breaks from time to time, and all?
SisyphusPostEpilogue03|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 03|Zagreus|I think I'm managing, thanks, sir. Though, back when you pushed Bouldy rather than talked to him... I suppose you didn't have much of a choice, did you?
SisyphusPostEpilogue03|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 03|Sisyphus|Well, it was work, you know? Even your Father has to work. Of course, I've since retired! But it seems you and he like to keep yourselves occupied. Whatever makes you feel content.
SisyphusAboutKeepsake01|Sisyphus About Keepsake 01|Sisyphus|Say, that's my Shattered Shackle on your person, right, Prince Z.? I'd recognize that clunky thing from anywhere. It serving you all right?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake01|Sisyphus About Keepsake 01|Zagreus|Hey sir, certainly it's been most welcome having something from you with me at all times. Though has it always held this power? And... how did you remove it to begin with?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake01|Sisyphus About Keepsake 01|Sisyphus|Bit of an odd story, that. Involved a well-timed accident with the old boulder there. Though, I'd best not get into it so that you're not accomplice to that little crime. Surely you understand?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake02|Sisyphus About Keepsake 02|Sisyphus|My Shattered Shackle's practically like new, there, Prince! Minus the part where it's still broken, and all that. Nice work!
SisyphusAboutKeepsake02|Sisyphus About Keepsake 02|Zagreus|Thanks, sir. It's been of help through my repeated treks across this realm, all thanks to you. You sure you don't want it back?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake02|Sisyphus About Keepsake 02|Sisyphus|*Hahahahah*! Absolutely not, though truly I appreciate the sentiment. I'd rather have a look at the old boulder there than a symbol of the time I first got stuck here, when I wasn't doing quite as well.
SisyphusAboutAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Sisyphus About About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Sisyphus|Word is that the most beautiful music's been heard up in Asphodel, lately, Prince! From the sound of it, why... I think that has got to be Eurydice and Orpheus!
SisyphusAboutAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Sisyphus About About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|You heard correctly, Sisyphus! Orpheus is reunited with his muse, at last. Or at least, he gets to visit on the regular, when he isn't busy at my father's house. So you've heard of them, have you?
SisyphusAboutAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Sisyphus About About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Sisyphus|Oh, I've more than heard of them! I'm sure you know how Orpheus once ventured all the way down here, after Eurydice passed on. I'll never forget his song! Even the Fury Sisters gave me a break, they were so captivated by it, then. *Ah*, good times. For me, at least!
SisyphusAboutLegendary01|Sisyphus About Legendary 01|Sisyphus|Prince Z., it seems you've brought my little Shady back to visit me! How very kind. And I can tell he's in good care of late.
SisyphusAboutLegendary01|Sisyphus About Legendary 01|Zagreus|He is, sir, and I'm grateful once again to have adopted him. You sure you don't want him back, though? Always seems like you could use a friend.
SisyphusAboutLegendary01|Sisyphus About Legendary 01|Sisyphus|All due respect, Highness, but I've the best friend anyone can ask for to my right just there. And as for little Shady, he was more inclined than I to see the farthest reaches of the Underworld. Safe travels to you both!
SisyphusAboutLegendary02|Sisyphus About Legendary 02|Zagreus|Sisyphus, sir? Have you any idea how Shady works? I'm able to just whisk both you and Bouldy out of here, and to my aid? It must be awfully disorienting.
SisyphusAboutLegendary02|Sisyphus About Legendary 02|Sisyphus|Well, Prince, I told you that we'd be with you in spirit, didn't I? It's not just Shady's power, I suppose, nor is it Bouldy's or my hidden strength. It's testament to our companionship, is all. You gods are capable of anything!
MegaeraWithSisyphus01_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (1)|Zagreus|She's gone... You still in one piece, Sisyphus? Not hurt or anything?
MegaeraWithSisyphus01_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (1)|Sisyphus|Oh I'm just fine, thanks, Prince. That Fury Sister, she is quite a lass, I have to say, and very, very strong. Bet she could push old Bouldy here better than I!
MegaeraWithSisyphus02_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Zagreus|You've really never gotten Bouldy to the top before?
MegaeraWithSisyphus02_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|Never got the boulder to the top, not even once. Always tumbles down right at the very end. Lost count after the nineteen thousandth time or so, but you know what? One of these days, I bet it's going to stick.
MegaeraWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Zagreus|Sisyphus, did I just hear correctly that Megaera has vowed to leave you be for now? Both you and Bouldy there?
MegaeraWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Why, I believe you heard just that, Your Highness! Seems the Fates are giving me a break. Although, the Fury Sister did declare that she'll be back to haunting me after she's through with you...
MegaeraWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Zagreus|Well, I bet I can keep her busy for a while yet. I'll take it as a bit of good news, sir.
ThanatosWithSisyphus01_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Sisyphus|Oh, I'm doing very well, thanks, Prince. I'm not afraid of him, I mean, what have I got to lose? Now here, I wanted you to have this.
ThanatosWithSisyphus02_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|Can you believe the nerve of that one, Prince? He's nothing but a blowhard, so, I simply tell him what he wants to hear! He can't stop me from helping you, besides. I'm dead already, what's he going to do?
ThanatosWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Prince Z.! Just missed your stern-faced colleague, feel that stillness hanging in the air? Sounds like he won't be checking up on me again anytime soon.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Zagreus|Thanatos really isn't such a bad sort once you get to know him, sir. Though, I suppose you'll have to take my word for that.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Oh, I believe it, Highness. I should think that bringing death must be a lonely job. Perhaps he ought to try pushing a boulder sometime!
SisyphusChat01|Sisyphus Chat 01|Sisyphus|Good to see you in one piece, Prince Z.!
SisyphusChat02|Sisyphus Chat 02|Sisyphus|Life treating you all right, I take it, Prince?
SisyphusChat03|Sisyphus Chat 03|Sisyphus|Oh I'm hanging in there, thanks for asking, Prince!
SisyphusChat04|Sisyphus Chat 04|Sisyphus|You'll make it out of here, I've no doubt about it!
SisyphusChat05|Sisyphus Chat 05|Sisyphus|Nice of you to drop in for a bit!
SisyphusChat06|Sisyphus Chat 06|Sisyphus|You are a sight for sore eyes, Prince!
SisyphusChat07|Sisyphus Chat 07|Sisyphus|Now you be careful out there, won't you, Prince?
SisyphusChat08|Sisyphus Chat 08|Sisyphus|You give them hell for me, all right, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat09|Sisyphus Chat 09|Sisyphus|Go get them for me, Prince!
SisyphusChat10|Sisyphus Chat 10|Sisyphus|Got just the thing for you here, Prince!
SisyphusChat11|Sisyphus Chat 11|Sisyphus|It's always good to see you, Prince!
SisyphusChat12|Sisyphus Chat 12|Sisyphus|You keep your chin up, Prince!
SisyphusChat13|Sisyphus Chat 13|Sisyphus|Keep fighting the good fight, there, Prince!
SisyphusChat14|Sisyphus Chat 14|Sisyphus|Hey you take care, you hear me, Prince?
SisyphusChat15|Sisyphus Chat 15|Sisyphus|Let's both of us keep going, that a deal?
SisyphusChat16|Sisyphus Chat 16|Sisyphus|It's good of you to visit me like this!
SisyphusChat17|Sisyphus Chat 17|Sisyphus|Hope everything's been well enough of late.
SisyphusChat18|Sisyphus Chat 18|Sisyphus|You watch your step out there, all right, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat19|Sisyphus Chat 19|Sisyphus|Hullo Highness, you're looking well enough!
SisyphusChat20|Sisyphus Chat 20|Sisyphus|Hey, Your Highness, how goes it, how is everything?
SisyphusChat21|Sisyphus Chat 21|Sisyphus|I have to say it's good to see a friendly face!
SisyphusChat22|Sisyphus Chat 22|Sisyphus|Always a pleasure, Highness, you take care out there.
SisyphusChat23|Sisyphus Chat 23|Sisyphus|Here's my best friend in all the Underworld, how goes it, Prince?
SisyphusChat24|Sisyphus Chat 24|Sisyphus|Glad you made it all this way, Prince Z.
SisyphusChat25|Sisyphus Chat 25|Sisyphus|Think I've got just the thing for you right here, Highness!
SisyphusChat26|Sisyphus Chat 26|Sisyphus|A brief hello from time to time does wonders, don't you think, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat27|Sisyphus Chat 27|Sisyphus|Much as I like the company of Bouldy there, you're always welcome, Prince!
SisyphusChat28|Sisyphus Chat 28|Sisyphus|Stop by whenever you're around these parts, all right, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat29|Sisyphus Chat 29|Sisyphus|I know it isn't much, Highness, but I do hope this helps!
SisyphusChat30|Sisyphus Chat 30|Sisyphus|Here's something courtesy of me and Bouldy, Prince!
SisyphusChat31|Sisyphus Chat 31|Sisyphus|How about a little bit of help as you keep on your journey, Prince?
SisyphusChat32|Sisyphus Chat 32|Sisyphus|Let's see if we might make your going slightly easier, there, Prince!
SisyphusChat33|Sisyphus Chat 33|Sisyphus|Should have something that ought to come in handy for you, Prince!
SisyphusChat34|Sisyphus Chat 34|Sisyphus|No need for these, so take one off my hands, won't you, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat35|Sisyphus Chat 35|Sisyphus|Bouldy and I have got the usual for you right here, Your Highness.
SisyphusChat36|Sisyphus Chat 36|Sisyphus|Highness, please take one of these and go!
SisyphusChat37|Sisyphus Chat 37|Sisyphus|All's well out here in Tartarus, Prince Z.! What will it be?
SisyphusChat38|Sisyphus Chat 38|Sisyphus|Bouldy and I got our usual selection here, Highness!
SisyphusChat39|Sisyphus Chat 39|Sisyphus|Don't let me keep you, Prince, I know you've plenty of important business here.
SisyphusChat40|Sisyphus Chat 40|Sisyphus|Before you go, Prince Z., a little souvenir from your fine stay in Tartarus.
SisyphusChat41|Sisyphus Chat 41|Sisyphus|Don't do anything I wouldn't do out there, you hear me, Prince?
SisyphusChat42|Sisyphus Chat 42|Sisyphus|You're looking good and ready for whatever lies ahead up there, Prince Z.!
SisyphusChat43|Sisyphus Chat 43|Sisyphus|You know approximately where to find me if you happen to be in the area again, Prince Z.!
SisyphusChat44|Sisyphus Chat 44|Sisyphus|Everything's fine as ever here, Prince Z., so you go on ahead, and don't look back!
SisyphusChat45|Sisyphus Chat 45|Sisyphus|I have a feeling you are going to make it all the way topside this time, Highness!
SisyphusChat46|Sisyphus Chat 46|Sisyphus|Need a little pick-me-up perhaps?
SisyphusMaxChat01|Sisyphus Max Chat 01|Sisyphus|Bouldy and I will always be here in your time of need, Prince Z.!
SisyphusMaxChat02|Sisyphus Max Chat 02|Sisyphus|Bouldy says whatever we can do to help, we'll do it, Prince!
SisyphusMaxChat03|Sisyphus Max Chat 03|Sisyphus|In case words of encouragement are not enough, have one of these here, Prince!
SisyphusMaxChat04|Sisyphus Max Chat 04|Sisyphus|Let's get you on your way, Prince Z., and in good spirits, too!
SisyphusMaxChat05|Sisyphus Max Chat 05|Sisyphus|Don't you worry, Highness, we have got you covered here!
SisyphusMaxChat06|Sisyphus Max Chat 06|Sisyphus|Told old Bouldy here you'd probably be back if only to say hi!
SisyphusMaxChat07|Sisyphus Max Chat 07|Sisyphus|Hey Prince, Bouldy and I will not be needing these, but maybe they can help!
SisyphusMaxChat08|Sisyphus Max Chat 08|Sisyphus|Just do the best you can, if you don't mind me saying so, Prince Z.!
SisyphusMaxChat09|Sisyphus Max Chat 09|Sisyphus|Speaking for myself and Bouldy there, we're always at your service, Prince.
SisyphusMaxChat10|Sisyphus Max Chat 10|Sisyphus|You get all the way up to the top and do whatever it is needs getting done, Highness!
SisyphusMaxChat11|Sisyphus Max Chat 11|Sisyphus|I know Bouldy believes in you every bit as much as I do, Prince!
SisyphusGift01|Sisyphus Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey, sir, thought this might ease your burden for a while.
SisyphusGift01|Sisyphus Gift 01|Sisyphus|Now hold a moment, Highness, I cannot accept something like this... not without giving back a little something in return, that is!
SisyphusGift02|Sisyphus Gift 02|Sisyphus|Oh, my, you're really giving that to me, there, Prince? But, I'm just, why would you...?
SisyphusGift02|Sisyphus Gift 02|Zagreus|You better believe it, sir. Now you take care, be seeing you around.
SisyphusGift03|Sisyphus Gift 03|Sisyphus|Why, Prince, you being serious right now, is that for me?
SisyphusGift03|Sisyphus Gift 03|Zagreus|You deserve better, Sisyphus! This really isn't much, but maybe it'll help you while away the days. Nights. Whatever time it is.
SisyphusGift04|Sisyphus Gift 04|Sisyphus|Wow, Your Highness, you... you really shouldn't have. Thank you for not forgetting about me.
SisyphusGift04|Sisyphus Gift 04|Zagreus|You're always a sight for sore eyes out here, Sisyphus. Thank you for always believing in me.
SisyphusGift05|Sisyphus Gift 05|Sisyphus|I'm really very flattered, Highness! You didn't have to get me anything, I mean, your company's more than enough for me!
SisyphusGift05|Sisyphus Gift 05|Zagreus|I figured you could do with something more than that this time around, good sir.
SisyphusGift06|Sisyphus Gift 06|Sisyphus|Oh, but this is just too much for me, Your Highness, thank you, really. I don't know how I can ever repay you.
SisyphusGift06|Sisyphus Gift 06|Zagreus|How about you keep on helping me not die as quickly as I might have otherwise, deal?
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Sisyphus, sir? You've helped me selflessly time after time without so much as asking anything in return. Wanted to say I'm very grateful, and thought you might like to try this. Here, for a special occasion!
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Sisyphus|Why, Prince, is this...? It is...! I've not so much as seen a bottle of it, much less sampled it, thank you so much! Although, with all respect, I cannot rightfully accept such a fine gift. Unless...
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Unless...? Oh no, you're not making me take something in return, you know this was a gift not an exchange, sir, right? Wait, what is that?
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Sisyphus|This, Highness, is a little friend of mine kept tucked away in Bouldy's care. Wherever you'll be going next, he'll make a worthy traveling companion. And when he's with you, Bouldy and I... we'll be with you in spirit, too.
SisyphusGift08_A|Sisyphus Gift 08 A|Sisyphus|Prince, that vintage Ambrosia bottle that you gave me, my! That was the greatest thing I ever tried, I think! Even Bouldy enjoyed the stuff!
SisyphusGift08_A|Sisyphus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|I thought you'd like it, sir. And so, I'm pleased to offer you another! Almost a shame we seldom get such imports from Olympus around here. I hope I can appreciate it for myself sometime. Once all this is over with, I think.
SisyphusGift08_A|Sisyphus Gift 08 A|Sisyphus|What? You mean that you've never touched the stuff yourself? You've much more self control than I have, there. Perhaps someday we'll have a chance to share some between us!
SisyphusGift08_B|Sisyphus Gift 08 B|Sisyphus|Prince, that vintage Ambrosia bottle that you gave me, my! That was the greatest thing I ever tried, I think! Even Bouldy enjoyed the stuff!
SisyphusGift08_B|Sisyphus Gift 08 B|Zagreus|I thought you'd like it, sir. And so, I'm pleased to offer you another! Almost a shame we seldom get such imports from Olympus around here.
SisyphusGift08_B|Sisyphus Gift 08 B|Sisyphus|Ah, look at what the Prince has brought for us, Bouldy! Perhaps someday we'll have a chance to share some between us!
SisyphusGift09_A|Sisyphus Gift 09 A|Sisyphus|All this, for someone such as me. You know I'm down here for a reason, don't you, Prince? Not just because your father and good Thanatos don't care for me. Yet, from the very first, you showed me decency I'd not experienced since I was a king. Perhaps not even then.
SisyphusGift09_A|Sisyphus Gift 09 A|Zagreus|Whoever it was you used to be, sir, I believe you've changed. And I'm proud to say that you're my friend. And Bouldy there as well. It's odd for me to say, but I am glad you're here. I think I've learned a lot from you, about all this.
SisyphusGift09_A|Sisyphus Gift 09 A|Sisyphus|Well, Your Highness, I am honored very much indeed, and having you amongst my list of friends makes it perhaps the greatest such a list a fellow such as I has ever had. Isn't that right, Bouldy?
SisyphusGift07|Sisyphus Gift 07|Sisyphus|Wait, really, this, this is for me, you mean it, Prince? I mean, I won't say no, I can't say no to such a thing, so, thank you! Thank you kindly.
SisyphusGift07|Sisyphus Gift 07|Zagreus|You're more than welcome, sir. For all you've done for me, it's the least I could do.
SisyphusGift08|Sisyphus Gift 08|Sisyphus|...I'm really rather speechless, Your Highness. I'm just a shade doing my time. I don't deserve your generosity.
SisyphusGift08|Sisyphus Gift 08|Zagreus|Come on, sir, what's a priceless bottle of the drink of the gods between friends?
