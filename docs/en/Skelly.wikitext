|"I'll level with you, pal. You have impressed somebody well above my pay grade here, and so... they have a little proposition for you, you listening?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Let me guess... they want me to fight all the way through the Underworld, having used the Pact of Punishment over there to make the going even more treacherous than it already is, and if I succeed, they'll reward me with some sort of useless trinket?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Wrong! We're talking something really big, here, pal, you see that thing back there? Trinket. Come on, what are you, scared?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Trophy Quest Bronze Unlocked 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"I just knew you had it in you, pal, enjoying your new prize? Pact of Punishment, *Shmact *of Punishment, no problem, know what I mean? 'Course, that was just the easy one you got there, pretty sure I could've got that one, myself."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, just so I understand. I literally toiled through hell and back, and my reward is just... a statue of you? Don't get me wrong, it's lovely, it's just... I don't know what I expected."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Look, boyo, there was a little mix-up when we put in the request for that thing, see? I told 'em to make something that'll make me look good with my sources, and anyway that's how it all turned out. The other ones turned out much better, though, you'll see!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Trophy Quest Silver Unlocked 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Skelly, let me ask you something. Did you really commission three nearly-identical statues of yourself to goad me into using the Pact of Punishment?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"I am offended, pal! You haven't even seen the third one yet, so how can you insinuate a thing like that?! Maybe I was wrong about you. I thought you really were the one!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're only saying that to get me to apologize and try and unlock the last of your three identical statues, aren't you."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*How could you*--? I would return those statues for a full refund right here and now, if I could move! And if there was a refund policy on them."
|-
! colspan="2" |Trophy Quest Gold Unlocked 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Look I'm sorry I messed up your statues, boyo. Really. When I saw them, I just kind of freaked. But then I figured there's no way he's going to see how they turned out, so, I just rolled with it, you know?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You shouldn't have underestimated me, mate. But... I shouldn't have said such awful things about your statues. You must have really gone out of your way to get them here."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Oh you better believe it, pal! So how about we call it even. We've been through a lot. Both of us! Really learned from this experience, and now, we share a deeper understanding, yeah?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly First Meeting
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Nice place you got here, boyo! Name's Skelly, how's it going, but enough with the small talk already, I'm here to do a job. So let me have it! Give me everything you got!!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't remember having you on payroll, mate. Who's your supervisor?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Oh-hoh*, I'm not about to rat my sources, pal! Just try and beat it out of me!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Misc Meeting 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Don't suppose I can talk you into fighting back this time?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Not a chance, boyo, I'm paid to take it not to dish it out! Now give it to me!!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Misc Meeting 02
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Hey, you're getting pretty strong, there, pal! Though, I am being paid to tell you that! But not being paid to not tell you that last part..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have to ask you something, mate. What do you even need the pay for, anyway?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"That, pal, is nobody's business but my own! Besides, it's impolite discussing money all the time! Now back to beating me to powder!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Let me give you a piece of advice, boyo. You run across a guy like me out there, you just give him a good stab right in the back without a second thought before he sends you crying back to Papa."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting 02
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"You getting pretty strong, I'll give you that, boyo. Strong enough to smack a guy like me right up against the wall and I'd go straight to pieces, *boom*! You just remember, when you're duking it out, the walls are your friend!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Smack guys against walls. Sound advice as ever, mate."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting 03
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Hey pal watch where you throw those bloodstone things of yours, you drop them, you go pick them up, you understand? But if somebody gives you grief, you got my permission to chuck one right in his eye!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'll just aim generally for the midsection since the eyes are a lot harder to hit in my experience."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting 04
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"You're pretty quick, you know, boyo! Just be sure to use that fancy dash of yours and keep 'em guessing! Don't let 'em catch you standing still!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Dash like mad instead of standing still. That's not the worst advice, I guess."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting 05
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Little tip, boyo? You find any coinage while you're out there, you be sure to pawn it off to that old Charon, boatman guy? Use it or lose it, pal, use it or lose it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanks, mate, note to self: Always spend everything I earn instead of ever saving."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting 06
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Once in a while, pal, you're going to see a real fancy bozo try to ruin your good time. You'll know him 'cause he's glowing like a light, but that's his special armor, see? You got to punch right through it, he's going to shrug you off until you do!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"For a good time, beware the fancy glowing bozos on my quest. Check."
|-

|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"You know something, boyo, I think you could do a real number on one of these columns holding up this place, and bring the whole thing down in just a few swipes, boom, boom, *BOOM*! I'd hate to be standing near one of them if you did!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wreck my father's finely crafted architecture every chance I get. That I can do for sure."
|-

|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Boyo, next time you make it to the big VIP area upstairs, you watch out for those weapon-wielding gents out there! The eyeball soul thing that pops out when you beat 'em? You got to squash those, too, or else they'll grab their gear and come right back!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Crush the souls of Elysium's Exalted shades to stop them from regenerating over and over. I'll definitely do that next time I'm there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting Easy Mode 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"If you're having a rough time out there, boyo, you just remember something: You're a *god*, all right?! Way tougher than you think. They give you trouble, you just turn on *God Mode*, and you let 'em have it for me!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You act as though this *God Mode *is some sort of lever I can simply switch at will if ever I wish to unlock my latent strength, there, mate."

|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Hey, I know people, pal! We'll just have to leave it at that. Now let's see you break some of these bones, huh?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly No More Hint Meetings 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Well, pal? You have come a pretty long way, let me tell *you*. I think most of the smarts I've picked up, you know by now. And so... if I'm fresh out of tips for you... I guess there's only one thing left to do."
|-

|"Stand there eternally to be whaled upon at my whim, using whichever weapon suits me at the time?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly About Skelly Painting 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, mate? I picked up a painting for our lounge that looked a little like yourself. Reminds me... have you ever even been inside? Should come join us sometime."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Ah, you know, while I appreciate that, there, boyo... those kind of social spaces, they're not really for me. I kind of like it out here, just me, these bats whizzing around from time to time.... Besides! The old contract makes it pretty clear I got to stay right here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What if I picked you up bodily and brought you in? Contract have anything to say about that?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Run Progress 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Got to say, you're really getting somewhere, boyo, I'm pretty impressed here! And they don't even pay me to do that, I'm just supposed to stand around!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Appreciate the vote of confidence, mate. Maybe you're right and someday I'll get out of here. Hey, if I never come back, you won't just be stuck here forever, will you?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Heh, hehehe*, that's a good one! *No*! Probably not. Wasn't anything in the old contract about that... *huh*."
|-

|-
|'''Skelly'''

|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Backstory 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Come on, mate, won't you say who hired you? Was it Achilles? Couldn't have been Nyx...? Is it that big a deal?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"I am an individual of some integrity, boyo, and protect my sources with my life! You'll have to kill me if you want to make me squeal!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Backstory 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, *uh*, Skelly? How'd you get here, anyway?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Oh, you know, just kind of zapped right in, like Papa lets us do! Some of us sometimes. Why do you ask?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I meant... how did you get to the realm of the dead, in the first place. Lord Hermes whisk you to the entryway? Thanatos scoop you up, Charon give you a lift, what?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Oh, *haha*! Well, that's a little personal, don't you think, boyo? I... I don't like to talk about it much. So, if I could have a little privacy...?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Backstory 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Skelly, is it really true you don't want to talk about how you got here? Just curious who you used to be. What you were like. Your real name."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Hey, what makes you think this isn't my real name, pal? I'm offended!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sorry, what I meant was... I was just interested to get to know you better, after all you've done to help. Anything you can share? Trade you for a detail about me!"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"...Well all right... I was once a commander of men. Name of Schelemeus. Captain of the Cretan second fleet, sailing on Athens under King Minos. We were unstoppable... but then one day... one wrong turn... and we sailed straight into the waters of Charybdis."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Skelly, that's... that's incredible! So then... you and your crew, you perished at sea?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"I, uh, *pfff, hahaha*, boyo, you are something else, you know? All that Schelemeus stuff, I could have had you eating out of my hand for days!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, I get it. You got me. Fine, then, *Schelemeus*, but I don't appreciate the trick."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Backstory 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, Skelly... or should I say *Schelemeus*? I happened to have a chat with somebody familiar with that name. Large bull-headed fellow originally from Crete. You said you made it all up! What's going on?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Never said I made it up, pal! I just knew you weren't going to believe me, I mean, look at me! I look like a captain of the Cretan second fleet to you?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know. I've never met one. Do they all just stand around doing nothing?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Well, sounds like *somebody*'s never had to lead like fifty-or-something sailors in a voyage across the sea in a Minoan galley with nothing but the stars to guide 'em! What do you think the captains do, pull the oars?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, what about Hermes? He gave me the impression you might have been somebody else. Nobody in particular. Not some great sea-captain."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"What is it with you gods talking behind the backs of all your friends, boyo?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Don't change the subject!"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Don't change the subject!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly About Sources 01

|"That Lucky Tooth you gave me, Skelly. First off, thanks again, and secondly... is this even yours? Had a run-in with Hermes, who got me thinking."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"What, *haha*, you going to believe everything that gabby guy tells you, now, boyo? He doesn't know a thing about me!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Never said he did. Though since you let on... what's your relationship to him? Working for him?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"No! Nope. Definitely not working for him, closer to a peer relationship. Well, other than the fact that he's a god and I'm just... well, what you see is what you get with me, pal. Hey, you won't tell anyone, will you? I'm just here to help, I swear!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly About Sources 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"All right, fess up, Skelly, who are you working for? I know it's not Achilles. It's not Nyx. Dusa has no idea who you are. My father... no way. Hypnos? Give me a break. So the House is ruled out."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Sorry, pal, my lips are sealed. How about we change the subject?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"How about you tell me who your sources are?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Nope!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Tell me."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"No way."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Tell me!"
|-

|-

|"Tell me, Skelly."
|-

|"Nuh-uh."
|-

|"Come on, tell me, please?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"No. Means. No."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why won't you tell me?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Nice try, pal."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What if I never hit you again?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"...Uh... no...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So help me, Skelly, if you don't tell me who you're working for, there will be no more violence between us, ever."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"No... please, have mercy, boyo..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No mercy, Skelly. Tell me. Or else... it will be only pleasantries between us from here on out."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Nrrrghh, *all right*! But you got to promise me something, promise not to let on or tell anybody in your fancy House, all right? Or else I'm done for. *I'm serious*!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I promise. So...?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"...It's Charon."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Charon! Huh."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Yeah. He's rich. He's got connections to guys like me, and I think he's got a horse in this chariot race you've got going on around here with Papa."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What's his angle?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"No idea. Maybe he likes you, maybe he's bored."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And Hermes... he's working for Charon, too?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Yep! Now, let's pretend like none of this ever happened, so I can stick around, all right? Remember, pal, you promised!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly About Sources 03

|'''Zagreus'''
|"Skelly, did you tell Charon and Hermes about our little conversation from before, about your sources? Because, I didn't tell them, but... they seemed to know."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Boyo, thought we agreed we weren't going to be having conversations on the subject from here on. Spares me having to spill my guts with my sources later."
|-

|"I didn't get you into too much trouble, did I?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly About Sources 04
|-

|"Hey, Skelly, what with everything out in the open now, with the Queen and Charon, and all that... mind if I mention some of this to Thanatos? Charon's his brother, after all."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Oh! Yeah, now that you mention it, I guess that part of the old contract no longer applies. So, go right ahead! Appreciate you asking, pal."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, Skelly, you worried something bad is going to happen if I express a bit of generosity from time to time through our somewhat-illicit gift-giving custom around here?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"No, I'm worried you'll be wasting your time! If you give that stuff away, don't expect to get anything back. Well, not after the first time, anyway. Usually! I'm just saying... don't get your hopes up."
|-

|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Ah, you've come to the right place regarding that, there, pal! It's your mean weapons back there that can find the stuff. Once you get all the way through Tartarus with one, that's all the blood you're going to get! For the time being anyhow."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"How am I supposed to keep track of which weapons I've earned these with, then?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Calm down, Skelly. I'm sure whatever it is is perfectly normal for a legendary semi-sentient Titan-slaying weapon from the dawn of time."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"That's just it! Those weapons of yours, they have seen some real business, pal. You're giving them a real workout, so maybe they're starting to like you or something? Loosening up a bit, you know? Like you and me!"

|-
|'''Skelly'''

|"Relax, boyo, just had a little chat with your old serving platter over there after you left, is all. That thing hits pretty hard! So, then, I say to it, *I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix*... and you want to know what happened after that?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So you carelessly spoke secret words imparted by the Fates themselves to an infernal weapon forged at the dawn of creation, then what? Say, did you walk up to Aegis, or just shout over your shoulder?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Over my shoulder! Anyway, what happened next was *nothing*! Your *Aegis *kept on bobbing like a dummy. So then I went and said that mumbo jumbo to every other weapon, but nope! Doesn't work at all. So much for your fancy sorcery, huh?"

|"You must have had yourself a real bash, with all those fancy gods and stuff! Could hear all the festivity from all the way out here. How was it, pal?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It... went better than expected, all in all. I hope you didn't feel left out! It was a pretty limited guest list. Kind of a diplomatic mission, I would say. Not quite as good a time as it might have sounded from the outside."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Ohh*, don't you even worry about me, there, pal! I much prefer the solitary life, and besides! When things are good for you, they're good for me. Glad everything worked out."

|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 10
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"This look like a shoulder to cry on to you, boyo?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 11
|-

|"Let me have it already, boyo, no holding back!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 12
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Let's see what you can do in terms of hitting me, pal!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 13
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"You could be hitting me right now, boyo!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 14
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Sure could go for somebody just whaling away on me right now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 15
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"What's the matter, you gone soft or something, pal?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 16
|-

|"You going to hit me over here, or what?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 17
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Go on, boyo, give me your best shot, it's my job!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 18
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Sure could use a good smack in the jaw from you right about now!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 19
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"You want to fight me, boyo, well hop to it, stat!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 20
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"What do I look like, pal, some kind of conversationalist?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Chat 21
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Our relationship, boyo, requires no exchange of words!"
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"For you, mate! Thought you might get a kick out of this."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"For me, pal? Awful nice of you, just awful nice, but guess what, I got this for you! Tit for tat, you understand, a deal's a deal!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 02
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Whoa-hoh*, you being serious here, pal? You brought that all this way, for little old me?! That's real nice of you!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're not so bad yourself, mate. Thanks for always being here for me to savagely attack without a second thought."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 03
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Whoaaaa*, now get a load of what you got there, boyo! Wait, really, that's for me? Or you just pulling my leg?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm really giving this to you, mate. Now go enjoy it, will you? Once I've finished pummeling you some more just for the sake of it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 04
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Heeey now *that's *what I'm talking about, thanks, boyo! Won't forget you doing me a solid like this, cross my heart!!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No need to thank me, mate. But don't you dare forget it or I'll attack you repeatedly and without mercy."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 05
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Oh look here, pal, I can't just keep accepting these from you! Not when they're paying me already, I got standards to uphold, you know?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I will look the other way if you do, mate. Now, here! Or else!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 06
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Haaah*, you're kidding, *what*? Sometimes, boyo, you make me feel alive again, you know that? Being honest with you here, I'm grateful, really."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"If not for you, my friend, I'd have no one to viciously attack with no fear of reprisal whatsoever."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 07
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Skelly, while I know your services have already been paid in full, your sources ought to know you've been doing an excellent job. So much so, I wanted to give you this."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Whaaa*, is that a vintage bottle of Ambrosia, pal?! I never even thought I'd get to try a thing like that, I mean, what am I, here? Know what, I want you to have this. To symbolize our friendship, and in case you ever need a hand out there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 08
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hope you enjoyed that vintage bottle of Ambrosia last time, Skelly, because I got you another. Here!"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"*Aww*, no way, boyo, you kidding me right now? Why are you even, I... look, I, I just stand around and let you beat me up, you don't have to do this. You don't even know who I am. Who I was."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're my friend, mate. That's all that matters. Although... I don't suppose you're willing to divulge those types of details? Just out of curiosity."
|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Gift 09
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, Skelly, I still cannot entirely get over that whole permanently-kill-you stunt you pulled on me. You had me deeply worried for a while, all for just a laugh?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Yeah, that's right! Not exactly much to do here, case you hadn't noticed recently! Good thing I'm able to stay occupied with intellectual pursuits."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's what you call it, then? In any case, I did want to make sure: You sure that you're all right, having to stand around like this?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"You kidding, pal? This is the life! Imagine getting paid to stand around! And being pals with you!"

|"*Hahaha*, got you pretty good, again, didn't I, boyo?! *I am asking you to get me out of here. *Hahahaha! All that stuff about your blade, and your Aspect, I mean, you ate all of it right up! *Woo, hoo-hoo!*"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It appears I've been the victim of an elaborate prank. Not sure that I appreciate it, Skelly. What if I were to never hit you again, how would you like that?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Whoa, *whoa whoa whoa whoa*, whoa! Now come on, boyo, it was just a joke, I figured things could lighten up a little here. Don't need to do anything rash!"
