|'''Persephone'''
|"...I spent many days tending this garden... or nights? Quite difficult to tell the time here. But, it's held on longer than I would have expected..."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"...Persephone... I..."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Cerberus! I missed you so. And dutiful as ever, aren't you."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"...I'm sorry. Know that I am sorry."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Hades... you look tired. Though, I am not the only one you ought to be apologizing to."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"I know. I know, I.... Why have you returned? If Olympus... if your mother discovers what happened, not even Zeus, not even ''he ''could stop what would transpire, here!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Oh'', I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Zagreus to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could just return the way I came?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Persephone."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"You're right, Hades! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"...I would do anything that you would ask of me."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Then, first, talk to your son."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"...''Mm''. Zagreus? You have already met Persephone, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wow, Father, you called me by my name! What is this strange sensation that I feel? Perhaps it's this ''deference ''of which you speak?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, Hades. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Yes. I... Zagreus. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought... you're honest."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left... believing you were stillborn... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, you didn't need to vent all that inner turmoil onto me throughout my life. Though, I think I understand. I only wish I could have understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I've grown so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really going to miss it."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"About that... your ''ransacking ''revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Zagreus... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Question, Father. Let's say I accept. When next I reach the surface... is it still going to be you waiting up there?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So I just battle to the surface and repeatedly kill my own father, then?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"You have it half-correct!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Hahaha'', well! I guess I'll see what I can do."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''After all this time'', it's only been a few days! But it's been good. Mother and Father are back together, made some new friends, got this fancy painting! Easy. All is well in the Underworld!"
|-

|'''Storyteller'''
|"''But then, there is the note... written finely in a hand and voice the likes of which the Prince had never seen or heard.''"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"'''Hades: I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place. So, I am leaving, even if it kills me. I won't be returning to Olympus. If there is a place where I belong in this world, it must be somewhere between heaven and hell. Perhaps it's on the coast and has a little garden. Take care of Cerberus; I shall miss him.'''"
|-
|'''Storyteller'''
|"''Thus did Prince of the Underworld Zagreus absorb the contents of this hidden letter, written in his mother's hand.''"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"His mother's hand, my mother's hand, wait, ''what''?! You're saying this Persephone, that she's my... mother...? But, but Father always said that Nyx was my.... That liar. He lied to me, they both did. All my life!"
|-
|'''Storyteller'''
|"''Uhhh erm thus did the Prince discover, inadvertently, the well-kept truth about his lineage. Entirely by chance, this did occur....''"

|"Meg. ''Oh''. I was not expecting company. Were you, just, casually snooping, or... is there something I can help you with?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"...I was just leaving, Zagreus. Happened to be in the area, no thanks to you, and thought I'd go retrieve the last of my possessions. I have to say, you've really let this place go to hell."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...She left. Great. Wonderful! I guess we'll just go back to killing each other repeatedly, then."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sorry. My mother's out there, somewhere. I won't rest until I can find her. You wouldn't understand."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You wouldn't know. What I'm trying to say is... with my sisters involved, it changes things. Takes some of the pressure off of me."
|-

|-

|"I'm saying... I know you need to find your mother, Zagreus. I have my part to play in all of this, but let me see what I can do, if anything."

|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"I'll level with you, pal. You have impressed somebody well above my pay grade here, and so... they have a little proposition for you, you listening?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Let me guess... they want me to fight all the way through the Underworld, having used the Pact of Punishment over there to make the going even more treacherous than it already is, and if I succeed, they'll reward me with some sort of useless trinket?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Wrong! We're talking something really big, here, pal, you see that thing back there? Trinket. Come on, what are you, scared?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Trophy Quest Bronze Unlocked 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"I just knew you had it in you, pal, enjoying your new prize? Pact of Punishment, ''Shmact ''of Punishment, no problem, know what I mean? 'Course, that was just the easy one you got there, pretty sure I could've got that one, myself."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, just so I understand. I literally toiled through hell and back, and my reward is just... a statue of you? Don't get me wrong, it's lovely, it's just... I don't know what I expected."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Look, boyo, there was a little mix-up when we put in the request for that thing, see? I told 'em to make something that'll make me look good with my sources, and anyway that's how it all turned out. The other ones turned out much better, though, you'll see!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Trophy Quest Silver Unlocked 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Skelly, let me ask you something. Did you really commission three nearly-identical statues of yourself to goad me into using the Pact of Punishment?"
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"I am offended, pal! You haven't even seen the third one yet, so how can you insinuate a thing like that?! Maybe I was wrong about you. I thought you really were the one!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're only saying that to get me to apologize and try and unlock the last of your three identical statues, aren't you."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"''How could you''--? I would return those statues for a full refund right here and now, if I could move! And if there was a refund policy on them."
|-
! colspan="2" |Trophy Quest Gold Unlocked 01
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Look I'm sorry I messed up your statues, boyo. Really. When I saw them, I just kind of freaked. But then I figured there's no way he's going to see how they turned out, so, I just rolled with it, you know?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You shouldn't have underestimated me, mate. But... I shouldn't have said such awful things about your statues. You must have really gone out of your way to get them here."
|-
|'''Skelly'''
|"Oh you better believe it, pal! So how about we call it even. We've been through a lot. Both of us! Really learned from this experience, and now, we share a deeper understanding, yeah?"

|-
! colspan="2" |Skelly Hint Meeting 02

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"May I help you with something, Zagreus?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Now that you mention it, you can, Meg. I was wondering what was Father carrying on with you about back home?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Eavesdropping again? If you must know, my job performance is under review. Though, I'm sure this job's about to go just fine."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Story Progress 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I sincerely hope that you enjoy these meetings with me while you can. I know I will."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Now that's a rather ominous thing to say to someone, Meg. Care to explain in terms an idiot like me could understand?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Lord Hades is exploring other options. He has no confidence in my ability to stop you anymore. Though, maybe it isn't too late for me to change his mind."

|"It's been a while, Zagreus. You must have made it pretty far last time. Let's see. Outer reaches of Asphodel?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Outer reaches of Asphodel. And I have to say, Meg, you are positively a sight compared with that blasted Bone Hydra stewing away up there."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"How very flattering, to have compared me to the remains of some mindless outsized lizard. Come, maybe I'll kill you just as easily as your new Hydra friend."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Run Progress 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"How many times have we been going at it like this, Zagreus? You tired of me, yet?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"We're both immortals, Meg. We'll be seeing plenty of each other for a while yet. I've come to welcome these occasions."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Then, good. Lashing you across the face beats waiting for the opportunity to do so. Come."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Run Progress 03
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I heard what happened. You crossed the River of Flame. You really did it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That Hydra was a total bastard, though. Bastard''s''. But, you sound practically impressed with me, there, Meg! I feel so flattered!"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You'll soon feel something else. I don't know how you did it. But it changes nothing."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Run Progress 04
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"How utterly disgusting... I was just counting, Zagreus, and as it happens, I have lost to you fifty times, already! If not more. Can you believe this? ''Ugh'', how I've fallen."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, don't take it so hard, Meg! Once you die several dozen times, you start to get accustomed to the emotional pain, as well as the physical! Up for some more of either?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Of course! Who do you think I am? Although I guess there's no use keeping score with you."
|-

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You know how many times you've beaten me, here, Zagreus? Can you even guess?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm''... feels like a lot, admittedly, I mean, we've been going at this for a while, now. Four hundred and twelve times...?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"...Five hundred times, exactly. Though I figure, you haven't been keeping track of how many times I've killed you. ''Ugh'', maybe that's my problem. Well, plenty of time to work it out after this."

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You beat Alecto, Zag. Could hear her screaming her head off about it all the way through Tartarus... I almost want to thank you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I almost want to say you're very welcome. Have you and she always been on bad terms like this?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"We have long-standing differences. It's worse with family. You know what it's like."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury About Tisiphone 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"''Huh''. Not even Tisiphone could stop you. Your father must be sorely disappointed."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He's difficult to please, that much is true. What happened to Tisiphone, anyway? She isn't much for conversation."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"It runs in the family. Tis only knows her work. And, professional distance is important."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury About Sisyphus 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"If there's anyone in all the Underworld who owes you, Zagreus, it's your friend, Sisyphus. He would be much worse off if not for you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, because I've been distracting you from administering lashings like before? I hate to think you prefer to whip with no fear of reprisal whatsoever, Meg."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Dereliction of duty and fear of reprisal are not one and the same. Though you don't seem to be concerned with either one."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury No Hammer Reaction 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Your weapon's looking rather dull, there, Zagreus. Great Daedalus decided not to grace you with his gifts this time around?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Now that you mention it, he hasn't, no. Though I'm prepared to say I don't need special augmentations to get past you."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Oh, we can put that to the test right now. Just remember, you need all the help you can get."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Darkness Reaction 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"That Mirror's made you stronger, Zagreus. You're fortunate to have Nyx helping you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No hard feelings. I think she feels partly responsible for all of this."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"She shouldn't. The only one responsible for all of this is you. And I thought even you would have understood that by now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Pact Reaction 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"''Tsch''. I can't believe it. You signed the Pact of Punishment. Have you completely lost your mind? Or just trying to insult me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well if you're going to be so rude about it, maybe a little of each? Though, what do you even care which pacts I sign or don't?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I'm not an idiot. I see what you're doing. You want to be punished? Then, come on."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Pact Reaction 01 B
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"''Tsch''. You really volunteered into a Pact of Punishment? You can't back out of it, now. You're even more of a fool than I already thought."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Maybe I just like a challenge, ever thought of that? Besides, what do you even care which pacts I sign or don't?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You're right. I ''don't ''care. You want to be punished? Then, come on."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Pact Reaction 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I have been longing for a fairer fight with you. Maybe that's why you signed the Pact? To pity me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have my reasons. Pitying you isn't one of them. Although I guess you don't believe me, do you?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"If it's punishment you want, how am I to say no?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Pact Reaction 02 B
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You know I can hit even harder than usual with the Pact of Punishment working against you. Maybe that's why you signed it? To pity me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have my reasons. Pitying you isn't one of them. Although I guess you don't believe me, do you?"
|-

|"No, I don't think I do. Come on, then, and let's see where all your pity gets you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Pact Reaction 04
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"This should be over pretty quickly, I think, Zag. Never took you for the Forced Overtime type. That's not a Pact condition for the faint of heart."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You wound me, Meg! You know I like to barge into situations thoughtlessly and recklessly, and sort everything out later. Forced Overtime's the perfect fit!"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"''Ahh'', well, when you put it that way. Look, don't go saying I didn't warn you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Chaos Reaction 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Hold it, Zagreus. I sense something, is that... ''ah''. You've been in contact with Chaos. So even they are now involved with this."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Just because Chaos is giving me the power to crush you doesn't mean they're getting involved with this, does it?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You don't know who or what you're dealing with. Ask Nyx about them for me sometime. Here, I'll give you a chance to ask her very soon."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Thanatos Reaction 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I know that Thanatos assisted you in getting to this point. I don't appreciate his interference."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sure you'll have a chance to tell him back at home."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"He has domain over the wretched shades, but his power has no sway with me. And neither does your own."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Thanatos Reaction 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I still cannot believe that Thanatos is helping you. I mistook him for someone with integrity."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You mistook him for someone who blindly follows orders without considering the implications."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"How dare you...! If you like death so much, then here, let me indulge you. Thanatos will welcome you with open arms."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury High Relationship 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Prince Zagreus, you are trespassing beyond the limits of your authority. I am under orders to stop you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Come on, Meg, why so formal all of a sudden? We've been through this countless times. Wait, is it because...?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Oh, come on, Zag. Will you just learn to play along, for once? Come on and fight me like you mean it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury High Relationship 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"What is it, Zagreus? You look a little hesitant to go another round with me. Or is it my imagination?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, it's just... can we really keep the personal and the professional completely separate like this, Meg? It's with mixed emotions that I fight you to the death, only to be happy to see you back at the House."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Then learn to keep your emotions in check. You keep them bottled up a while, they'll be that much stronger when it's time to let them out."
|-

|"Nice gloves, there, Zagreus. Think you can take me up close with those things? Well within striking distance of my whip."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Not wearing them for fashion's sake, here, Meg. You won't mind if I give you my best shot with Malphon here, will you?"

|-

|"What happened to your weapon, Zagreus? I sensed its power long before you turned up. That isn't just some Daedalus enchantment on it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, Stygius and I have been getting much more closely acquainted lately, Meg. Would you care to see the fruits of our healthy symbiotic relationship?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You, in a healthy relationship? Why yes, then this I have to see."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Keepsake Reaction 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Nice earring, Zagreus. Maybe I should have thought twice before giving you a thing like that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why, because the gift you generously gave me may end up being instrumental in your own demise? Sounds straight out of one of those tales the mortals like to go spreading around."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"They like it when best-laid plans fall completely to pieces, don't they? You better grow to like it, too."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Thanatos Keepsake Reaction 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I sense something of death upon you, Zagreus. What's that you have, something from Thanatos is it?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, this old thing? It's just a listless butterfly Than gave me, which happens to fill me with even more supernatural strength than usual. Don't pay it any mind."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Not even Thanatos can help you here. But if I ever start a bug collection, I'll know who to call."
|-

|"Come on, Meg, you can do anything if you set your mind to it! Though, don't worry, Battie's just here for the show."

|"Then, let's make it a good one. Come on."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Legendary Keepsake Reaction 01

|"Your little bat companion not too much to handle, is she, Zagreus? I trust you're taking excellent care of her. Not that she needs your help."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh she's been positively perfect, thank you, Meg. Especially in how she puts us into contact when I need a hand. I hope it's not too much hassle, helping out from time to time?"
|-

|-

|"Look at yourself, Zagreus, you are a total mess. Halfway to death or worse. You're making this too easy."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hit a few snags on my way to meet you, Meg. So, if you wouldn't mind going easy on me this one?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Not on your life or death. But I will kill you quickly, how's that?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Low Health 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You're wounded, Zagreus. How unbecoming of a god. Not to mention that I have the upper hand."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I figured I'd give you a head start this time, so I let the wretched shades bludgeon me repeatedly along the way."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Fool. If you're half-dead already by the time you get to me, what hope can you possibly have for what lies ahead?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Low Health 03
|-

|"You look like you had trouble getting to me, Zagreus. Did you try asking for directions on the way?"

|-

|"You're not escaping death this time, here, Zagreus. You ready to go home?"

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Well I appreciate the warning. Now prepare to die."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Encounter 01
|-

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Maybe persistence will pay off for both of us. Come, then."
|-
! colspan="2" |Fury Encounter 02
|-

|"And there you are again. Lord Hades ought to lock you up rather than let you run amok in his domain like this."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sure he'd welcome all this feedback from you, Meg. Or maybe you're just pining for my father's job?"
|-

|"I have no envy for your father's position. Besides, I happen to enjoy my own responsibilities."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Admit it, Meg. You can't stop thinking about me."

|"Don't flatter yourself. I think of you in pain. And now there's no more need for the imagination."

|-

|"What, this? I just picked it out of a Well. Was supposed to help me get here. No offense intended, more than usual. What's it to you?"

|"I've no such fear, myself, Theseus. Though, I appreciate you noticing. You're quite an inspiration, you know? I wouldn't come all this way to destroy just anyone."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx saved me.... So according to the Fates I was never meant to be born, since neither you nor Mother are of the Underworld, something like that? Or was that just another lie you told, to Mother and whoever else?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Bah! ''You think everything a lie. The realm beneath our feet was appointed to me on certain conditions, not that I had much of a choice. Among them: A one-time surface-dweller such as I would never have an heir."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You really believed that? Then why attempt to have a child, anyway?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"You don't know anything! Why anyone would ''choose ''to have a child is a mystery to me. The Fates said I would never have an heir. Perhaps ''this ''was all they meant."

|-

|"''Tsch. ''Be grateful they have not found out as yet, for all your meddling. You do not know them as well as you think. Ask yourself why she left Olympus, and how. Or better yet, ask ''her''."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, she seems quite lovely, so... knowing you, you probably tricked her into signing a pact to come join you, or something. Since you weren't allowed on Olympus, why not have Olympus come to you?"
|-

|"''Hah''! Surprisingly not distant from the truth. I took her, boy! I took her down with me. Is that what you wish to hear? Does that anger you? Come, bring forth that anger, then!"
|-

|"So, boy. Did you ask her? About how she came to join me in the Underworld. Did you confirm all your suspicions, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You didn't drag her down to hell, yourself, apparently. You're not going to tell me who did, though I can well imagine. Your brothers got to reign forever on Olympus, while you got sent down into the Underworld. So they gave you a consolation prize... didn't they?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"You make such accusations, knowing next to nothing. Careless as ever. Poseidon had nothing to do with it! He knows even less than you. If you value her existence or your own, you would be wise to keep it that way. And to turn back!"
|-

|"Oh, what would you even know?! You claim so much respect for her, yet you didn't even respect her enough to tell her what happened after she left! But... what am I saying... I know you love her, still, Father. That best explains all the terrible choices you've made."

|-

|"Maybe they just think you're in the wrong. And that you're an obstinate, overbearing, miserable excuse for a husband and father. Don't you understand I'm trying to fix the problems you caused? Since you're so unwilling to do it yourself."
|-

|"You're right. I was unwilling. I made my choices, in all this. I loved her, yes. I loved her terribly. But now... it seems I am merely delaying the inevitable. Go, then. Go to her. But, should harm befall her... I shall bring my worst wrath upon whomever is to blame... including you."

|-
|'''Poseidon'''
|"I thought I told you, Nephew, not to make such offerings to me? Ah, probably forgot! Or getting you mixed up, perhaps, for I have many other nephews, thanks to Zeus! Though, between us, I don't like any one of them as much as you!"

|"Uncle Poseidon, sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like had you been a part of it sooner. Your encouragement, your enthusiasm... it means a lot. To you! This Ambrosia's been to hell and back!"
|-
|'''Poseidon'''
|"''Hohhh'', but isn't this a kingly offering, indeed, my little Hades! I know how difficult it must have been to get, so distant from Olympus as you are! I'll never understand how come your father's cruel to you, for if you were my son, I would be proud! Proud anyway, but you get the idea."

|-
|'''Demeter'''
|"I understand, young Zagreus, that you would seek to leave that bitter darkness for this bitter cold? Quite honestly I fail to see why. But I'll aid your plight, why not? For I can offer plenty of assistance, and you soon shall grow fond of it, I think."

|"As we become acquainted, Son of Hades, I shall make myself quite clear in one respect: I fear I have a lack of patience for discussion. When visiting, please merely listen, then accept my mark, and then depart. Respond only when necessary. Or when prompted. Yes?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...Merely listen, so it's just like when I get those messages from the Olympians. Wait, you did just prompt me, Master Chaos, didn't you? Or should I have remained silent just now?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She isn't my birthmother, no, but she is like a mother to me. Do you know her?"
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"Oh, I know the goddess Nyx quite well, of course. Though, it has been a while since we last communicated, and I fear... well, I was not the charitable sort, back then. It is my hope that Nyx is faring well."
|-
! colspan="2" |Chaos About Nyx 01 B
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"I knew you would arrive. But only in the moments prior to the fact. Thus, I am experiencing residual surprise. Your movements through the Underworld are as though a veil of darkness enshrouds you. The goddess Nyx's influence, perhaps? Respond."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I... do not know how to respond to that, exactly, Master Chaos, but, Nyx, yes, she has been aiding me, in my attempts to flee my father's realm."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"You move in darkness, not as infinitely black as hers, but reminiscent to me, nonetheless. I would invite her to try to elude me, and then attempt to locate her. A minor amusement for the both of us. Now, I have you for this, I see."
|-

|"Master Chaos, it's Persephone, my mother. She's returned! She's chosen to return. So... things feel different, certainly, with her around, although... I didn't feel any sort of shift."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"You may not sense these shifts as I. The lightness of this space bends and adjusts with time. What you describe... it must have been the cause. I trust that the occasion is a welcome one. And I am pleased that you returned, nevertheless."
|-

|"Again I sensed some sort of shifting in your father's residence. You seek to ask something of me about it, do you not? Respond."
|-

|"Oh, I'm glad you asked, it's just... my mother, she's... we're reaching out to the Olympians. Trying to reconnect the family. It's been a while, relatively, since she and Father saw the others, but... in case a gathering occurs, I did wish you to know you're cordially invited, too."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"Cordially invited...? A generous proposal, Son of Hades, though unless your gathering is to occur within my space, please understand it would be difficult for me to bring the full entirety of my presence there. However... I think I can arrange to be with you in some capacity. Thank you."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Master Chaos? The goddess Nyx, she... seems to want to speak with you again. I wonder, would you maybe contact her sometime? She seems convinced it is your move to make if you so choose."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"The goddess Nyx wishes to hear from me...? Now that is unexpected, Son of Hades, and I wonder if, perhaps, this is a jest of yours. Though, your intentions evidently are sincere. Then, I shall make no promises in this, except that... I am considering the possibility."
|-
! colspan="2" |Chaos About Nyx 04
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"After some consideration, and on your recommendation, I attempted lately to make contact with the goddess Nyx again. She is quite distant from me now, of course. If you happen to know... did she receive the message well? Respond."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, Master Chaos, she can be a little difficult to read at times, but... I got the impression she was quite surprised, even excited to have heard from you again. She said that she would think about how to respond. Or, whether to respond."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"I see. Well, she shall find a way, if it is warranted. I always did expect the world from her. There were times when I expected her to shine as bright as day, though she is Night. When she achieved a certain level of ability... she left. And I could not find her."
|-
! colspan="2" |Chaos Post Flashback 01

|"Have you grown trusting yet of the Olympians, for all their generosity? Perhaps you ought to let them know the truth about your journey's goal. They are vain, and think that it is them you seek."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'll never get out of here if not for their help, but... I can't let them know about Mother. She wants to remain hidden from them."
|-

|"Oh, it's just... I sometimes wonder, Master Chaos... if you created all of this, then... who created ''you''? What was this place before you arrived?"
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"All of this simply came to be, and so did I, presumably after a former time had finally reached its end. I hesitate to say it was an act of will. It was more like a sudden shift, as when a conflagration happens from a spark. I arrived at such a time, and all else then arrived, from me."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I do. She's somewhere on the surface. That's why I keep on finding you like this. I'm trying to find her."

|"Oh, Master Chaos... you should know I have located her, already. Though where she is, I cannot stay for long. So I am visiting, as often as I can. It's... not unlike our visits here. Only, somehow, even harder to get to where she is."

|"Oh! I... Master Chaos, I don't know what to expect from there. But, to be direct with you, if I could leave the Underworld forever... I think I would. Though, I would miss you. Many others here."

|"...I would miss you as well. Thank you for telling me."
|-
! colspan="2" |Chaos Post Ending 02
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"Tell me something, Son of Hades. If the one who called herself Persephone is back, then... why do you continue to return? Respond."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Master Chaos, it seems I've developed something of a talent around breaking out of here. Or, there, I mean, the Underworld, so... it's become more of an official role for me, I guess. If escape shouldn't be possible, then someone needs to find the gaps."
|-

|-

|"That's right, Master Chaos. My father personally takes it upon himself to stop me in the event none of his underlings beat him to it. He... can be a handful."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"Well, then. Consider bringing to one of your future interactions the small round catalyst, which I provided you. The one in the shape you call an egg? It shall serve no purpose there at all. Yet if you succeed, then it shall bring us some amusement, shall it not?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"A waking-phrase... and an all-seeing artifact, you must mean Aegis, right? So I'm to say to it, ''I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame'', and it'll wake right up. Though, can you tell me what it means, or who?"

|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"If it is unclear yet, Son of Hades, I shall not be giving more to you in exchange for your repeated offerings. You give them to me knowing it shall serve no purpose and achieve no end. I know that there are some among both mortals and your kind for whom this is quite unacceptable."
|-
! colspan="2" |Chaos Gift 07
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"This is the greatest delicacy of Olympus, Master Chaos. It's for you. I think normally it would be difficult for the Olympians to get it to you here."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"You make an even greater offering to me, knowing it shall produce no material result. You are aware that I am not persuadable? Yours is a squandering of resources and time. Although, of course, we do have each of these in great supply. Now then, respond."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...I just think the act of giving isn't quite the same as an exchange. I know I won't be getting any sort of other talisman or something in return. But, through these offerings, I can express my thanks. That's worth it by itself."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"...I see. So then, the action is akin to theft. For you are getting something in return that I did not intend to give. I still have much to learn from my creations, Son of Hades. So let us say that we have made an even trade. My learning for your worth."
|-

|"If you'll forgive me, Master Chaos, this Ambrosia is intended to be given to those whom I care about, and I can think of few recipients I'd like to have it more. Please."
|-
|'''Chaos'''
|"I shall accept this, as a final offering, O Son of Hades. For I have given it additional consideration, and decided that my previous analysis of your intentions was too narrow, too inaccurate. And, I regret comparing what you have been doing to an act of theft. Respond?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Don't even mention it, please, Master Chaos. All of this is new for me, as well. I try never to overanalyze... my father does enough of that for all of us. I just know, when I encounter the primordial creator, I am going to give thanks. For everything."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, Father! I must say ransacking your domain beats having to toil endlessly in the administrative chamber. Far less painful, really."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Hah! ''Is that your way of asking me for your old job back, boy? You were a scourge upon every administrative duty to which you were assigned."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes, please, Father, give me back my old, wretched job, won't you?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Privileges are ''earned ''not begged for, boy. Unless you plan to reimburse this House for all the income that we lost because of you, then you shall not so much as set foot in the administrative chamber, again."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"How much is the reimbursement fee, anyway?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Whichever exorbitant amount the House Contractor has on record, now leave me be!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hades About Office 01
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"So help me, boy, I cannot fathom why you would have bought back the authority to enter the administrative chamber once again."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I knew you thought I'd never do it under any circumstances, Father. That seemed reason enough. Though, fear not, I've no plans to reapply for a position there."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"That does alleviate a deeply rooted fear of mine, in fact. The scene you caused in your brief time there yet remains a widely talked-about event among the shades who toil for me still."

! colspan="2" |Hades About Shoulder Skulls 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Always wanted to ask you something, Father. Whose skull is that there on your shoulder? If it's not too personal."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"I did not chronicle all Typhon's wretched offspring, boy. No one did. Some of them sit upon our shoulders now, lest we forget that things could easily have turned out rather differently, and much, much worse."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So these are just the remains of the spawn of the most hideous monstrosity of all time, which you and your brothers slew, got it. I guess putting the dead in their place is all part of the job. I can hardly imagine what it was like before you and the Olympians took charge."
|-

|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Be certain that you take appropriate precautions with the Sigil of the Dead that you now bear. Should some misfortune come to it through negligence, it cannot be replaced."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I can't imagine what I'd do without your blessing, Father! But, thank you again. I don't often inherit Fate-appointed honors, and will take good care of it. Though... what if the Olympians catch on? Wouldn't do for everybody knowing that you're aiding me even a little, right?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Correct. It would not do, at all. Fortunately, the power of the Unseen can remain well-hidden as it pleases. What is it your instructor always says?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah, well... I'm to attempt to escape this place by any means necessary, right? I figure if I can call on Olympus for aid, maybe some of my friends can help me in a pinch, as well."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Not what I mean. Some of your ''friends ''have been reluctant to engage against me during our scuffles on the surface. Know that I have authorized them to proceed, if necessary."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, really? You're saying it's OK for your own loyal subjects to side against you up there? You won't take it out on them?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"I consider it an expansion of their responsibilities. Now, go."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hades About Zagreus Promotion 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So tell me, Father. Just how much did it hurt your soul knowing my face is up there on the Featured Houseservant Board, for all in the lounge to see?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Has it occurred to you that I, alone, have final say about whose countenance is shown up there? Although, others who shall not be named did put in a good word for you, repeatedly."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Blood and darkness... all my life I thought that board was a joke. But seeing my face up there... it felt good. Thanks, Father. Maybe it won't be the last time."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Maybe a little of each? Or maybe you ought not second-guess my every motive and decision, constantly, searching for some sinister agenda that has yet to cross my mind?"

|-

|"Guess what, Father? The lounge is all tidied up. Your House Contractor there is quite efficient once you muster up the necessary funds. You should try it sometime!"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Are you expecting words of thanks because you paid the contractor to fix a bit of devastation that you caused? I fear it shall take rather more than that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What if I replaced every furnishing in this blasted place, would you treat me any better then?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"I suppose, boy, that there's only one way to find out. Though I suggest you save yourself the trouble."

|-

|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Hades About Orpheus Sings Again 02
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It says I'm really the bastard son of Zeus, but also indelibly connected to the god of wine, and how your parents tore me to pieces, giving rise to mortals, but that I'm always going to be stuck here."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"You fill Orpheus' mind with nonsense, he produces nonsense. Nonsense I presume shall spread from this place far and wide, so everyone might know that I have nothing to do with you."

|-
! colspan="2" |Hades About Eurydice 01

|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Pah! ''Orpheus is a talented musician, and a fool. I knew he would never get his beloved wife out of here. There's no escape for her, or anyone, including you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So you tricked him. Or maybe offered him a deal in bad faith. No matter. What's it going to take to waive the separation order between them?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"That's non-negotiable, boy. Waiving a separation order! That's a veritable fortune in dues alone. Off the table. Now, go mind your own affairs, and leave the waiving and the ordering to me."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01
|-

|-
|'''Hades'''
|"I have considered many possibilities, boy. And I trust Orpheus considered many possibilities before he signed away his rights to see his so-called muse when once he invaded my realm!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So you're forcing him to stay here for eternity just because he signed a contract with you?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Contracts with me are binding! Until such time as they dig themselves out of the archives and tear themselves up! And I don't see that happening anytime soon."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01 B
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Father, let's say, hypothetically, that I could pay the dues to waive the separation order between Orpheus and Eurydice. Would you honor the new terms, or spitefully cheat me out of a fair deal?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"I honor the terms of my commitments, boy. The rules we put in place are all that keep this Underworld in any semblance of a shape! But, what you ask is utterly absurd. The costs of processing a separation order are well beyond your means."
|-

|-

|-
|'''Hades'''
|"You come to ''me ''to question how I allocate my resources? Preposterous. I care nothing for that wretched shade. That he is tortured for eternity is but a technicality resulting from his arrogance. The terms of his incarceration are long lost!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So then if I could somehow find those terms, then theoretically, I could grant him a pardon..."
|-

|"If you could somehow do your job, and enact miracles, then yes! You could do anything, then, I suppose. Including waste your time on those of his undeserving ilk."
|-

|"Only you, Father. Good thing I've inherited some of your Fate-given authority, being your son and all. Otherwise some of your most loyal subjects would be bound by exploitive terms for eternity."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Terms that ''they ''chose, themselves! Terms to the benefit of this House. What if Achilles were to leave his post for the green pastures of Elysium, what then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You could find a replacement? But it's a pointless question anyway, because he's here! He isn't leaving. He might even do better at his job, now that he has increased ability to step away from it."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Perhaps you ought to have me bound next to Prometheus, and have the dreaded Eagle peck my liver for eternity?"

|-

|"Admit it, Father. Theseus was the only hero you were able to recruit to stand against me. All the while he gets to boast about being the champion. What, was Heracles too busy for the task?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Speak not to me of Heracles. You know these heroes by their deeds, not by their character. Heracles is fortunate he's in my brother's favor. Else he would be in Tartarus where he belongs. The mortal concept of what constitutes a hero is absurd."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I didn't often stop to give it much thought. I just knew I needed to find her... and then as soon as I did, I knew I needed her in my life. In other words, doing you any favors was never a priority, Father. Just ended up that way, I guess."

|"''Erm'', Father... I know we can't exactly change the past, but we can try to move forward. Look, I know I'm not even supposed to have this stuff, but everyone likes it, won't you try it, at least? Here, take it, either way."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Hrm''. I... can dispose of this properly. Speaking of disposal... I've no further need for this, here, so... rid me of it, why don't you? On your way out."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hades Gift 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"More Nectar for the old disposal service, Father, if you don't mind. Come on, you must have tried the stuff, at least in the days before you were here! Didn't you ever enjoy yourself, at any point?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"I don't require beverages in order to enjoy myself, boy. Unlike so many of your kin upon their mountain. Yet this blasted substance somehow finds its way to my domain. Then, fine! You wish for the customs here to be more akin to Olympus, why not?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hades Gift 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Have another bottle, why don't you, Father? Not like it's going to change anything between us, right? All the Nectar in the Underworld can't change what's already happened. Or change yourself."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Hrm''. You're probably correct. You must think it is my age that makes me obstinate. Unable to change my nature. But I have always been inflexible. You think I'm proud of it? You call me '''Father' ''like it's an insult. I deserve the title only as a technicality, I know."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You could start being a better father at any point. There's no one stopping you but you."
|-

|"Yes, well... unfortunately, I am a significant impediment. You should be well aware of that. ''You ''were able to stop me. I have thus far been unable to do so..."
|-

|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Enough of this, boy! Even mortals know better. I don't want your Nectar, or Ambrosia, or whichever offerings. You owe me no such thing, and I shall not accept it any longer. In fact, here... you shall take all of it back!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why? It's just Nectar, Father, lighten up. I get that you're surly about everything, but please at least try toward decency with me! If not for me, then for Mother."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"How dare you lecture me? I mean... ''urgh''... look. As you told me yourself... there's no changing what already transpired. And our memories are warnings. When you have lived as long as I have... you come to understand your weaknesses."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What are you getting at? You're just going to give up, stick with what's comfortable for you instead of making any real effort at making peace with your son?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Rngh''. Listen to me. My attempts at making peace are going to be rather subtle for your tastes. I cannot change the past. And there is only so much I can do about the future. I tell you this because... I shall not lie to you again. That much, I swear."

|"Well? What is the latest explanation for your tardiness? Lost track of time admiring the courtyard view? Perhaps you were recuperating from your martial training. Achilles is not prone to holding back."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I... I'm sorry, Father, I just overslept. I must have overslept. How am I even supposed to know exactly when to be here, I mean, every moment every day and night, here, it's all the same!"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"It's ''not ''at all the same! The hue of Ixion's green light takes on an obviously lighter hue when it is time! You're an embarrassment not just to me, here, boy, but to this entire operation. Now get back to work!"
|-

|"Not only were you late, again... but then you also failed to perform even the simplest tasks that I had asked, repeatedly, that you complete. How many chances do you need at this? I am too lenient with you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Too lenient? Instead of lambasting me nonstop, have you considered, maybe, training me some more to do this fascinating work to your satisfaction? You'll forgive me if I didn't memorize every laborious detail the last time you performed your monologue about how all this works."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Excuse me''?! If I am not mistaken, you're deflecting your incompetence toward ''me''? As though the Goddess of Wisdom herself has come to aid you in your time of need! I could replace you here and now with any number of simple shades, hungry to work here!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Then why don't you?! I don't want any of this. I'm not the one who drew the short lot with your brothers and got stuck here forever!! Why am I having to do this senseless parchment-pushing for you?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"Why are you stuck? You're not. You're ''fired''! I was wrong to think you were prepared to take on any responsibility at all. And, don't you ever invoke your uncles here again. Or I'll have you cast into the lowest pits of Tartarus. Now, get out of my administration, and my sight!"

|-
|'''Storyteller'''
|"''The bond between a hound and its master is as hard as adamant. Cerberus, the fearsome monster born of hell, and guardian of its gates, answers firstly to the Prince's father. But it turns out, the Prince may be the next best thing.''"

|"''Hahaha'', no, but seriously, boy. I know why you're here. There has to be a way to make you look the other way. What if I help you with the Satyr problem, would you let me go? Please. I have to find Persephone... my mother. You know what this means to me."

|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, is it really true that Cerberus ripped the lounge up right after I left? He must have gotten in a lot of trouble."

|'''Achilles'''
|"I only wish you could have seen it, lad. The place looked like a vineyard after a typhoon! Your lord father was livid. But he never gets so angry with the dog. Poor Dusa, though, she's picking the place up."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, that? It's nothing. Though I'm glad it's made a difference for the better. Our contractor's been doing all the work, I'm just putting in the orders."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"And the funds. Your father runs the Underworld a certain way. This old House is lavish, I suppose, but he has long since ceased trying to make it livable, at all. So the changes are appreciated."

|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Misc Meeting 03

|'''Achilles'''
|"Your enemy is not the wretched dead, and not your father, lad. It is the Underworld, itself. It has been fashioned to prevent escape. You must have seen, by now, how all the chambers seem to rearrange themselves."

|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Fist Weapon 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I got acquainted with the Twin Fists of Malphon recently, sir. Fills me with a kind of battle-hunger I'd not felt before. To think the empty hand could have as much destructive force as any weapon."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"The empty hand has more destructive force than any weapon, lad. It is the only weapon that can wield all others. And without it, all others are nearly powerless. The Twin Fists are a testament to that. Use them with care. Don't lose your head out there."

|"Between us, lad... I wish it wasn't. Were such a thing available to my enemies during my fighting days, I surely would have come here even sooner. But I trust you have the training to use it well. May it serve you as it served the fire goddess Hestia... she hasn't needed it in a while."

|"Oh, that? Just another job from the House Contractor near as I'm concerned, sir. Not like anything on the list was getting done while it was stuck in the archives, besides!"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, that's the spirit, I suppose. If there's one thing I know, it's that the Three Fates always get their way; but if you wish to help them go about it, then perhaps they'll pay you back in kind."
|-

|"I think I see that look again, if I am not mistaken in it, lad. What's on your mind? If you would like to share, I'm listening."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Oh'', it's just... sometimes, I find my thoughts, they wander between those I care about, it's... not just one. You mortals, typically you had a single suitor, did you not...?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"So we often told each other, yes. But... you're not like us mortals, or us shades. Nor are most of the others here. You gods... I cannot think of even one who had a single mate. Although, your father... maybe he is one."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, you're saying Father, he was never with somebody else besides... my mother?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, I of course don't know so very much about him, lad. But that's the way of it, from what I've learned. You needn't follow in his footsteps, though; I think you know that well enough by now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Being Close With Megaera 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Meant to tell you. Recently, I noticed Megaera, and... I believe I saw the faintest smile play across her lips. That anything to do with you, perhaps? Not asking for specifics, mind."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You really think that has to do with me...? I mean, I hope you're right, and I suppose it's possible, it's just... how can you tell?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Perhaps with time, I've grown keen to more than just the weaknesses of my enemies on the battlefield. Especially since I don't have those anymore. I'm happy for you, lad. The two of you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Being Close With Thanatos 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I have to tell you something, lad. When Thanatos returned to seek you out, I was very concerned. Not just for you, either. But you've since patched things up...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think so. I hope so. It was complicated for a while there, but... I think things are clearer for us, now. Not just in the moment, but in retrospect. ''Ugh'', I'm not making any sense."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, on the contrary. I think I know exactly what you mean. I don't know Thanatos particularly well. Wasn't he who brought me here, you see. And he was always very busy, like your father. But, he always struck me as a decent sort."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Fury Sisters 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I ran into Meg's sisters out there. We didn't really hit it off. Meg said they're not permitted in the House. Not that I'm complaining, but... what's that about?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"They have not earned the right, lad. Nor expressed any desire to exist here with the rest of us. Your father has assigned them to specific roles that suit their dispositions. They're... not as sensible as Megaera, in my experience."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's what I was afraid of. Although, fear is for the weak."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Thanatos 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You saw that Thanatos is back, didn't you, lad? He's been over there brooding, when he's around, at least."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I saw, Achilles. I think he's angry with me because of my decision to leave the House. Not that it's any of his business."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, don't say that. It isn't everyday or night when one discovers that his closest friend has had it with his temperamental father, and decided to leave home. I think he's struggling with what to make of it. Be gentle with him, will you?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Zagreus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Achilles, I... uncovered a late passage in the Codex, with regard to Thanatos and me. It says, ''you ''say, you think that I'm the god of ''blood''? I'm not the god of anything, I think..."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, nonsense, lad! If you're a god, then you're the god of ''something'', I'm sure. It's just an observation, and I genuinely hope it's no offense. But, see... your father, and your mother, and your bloodstones, and your disposition..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Skelly 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I've been meaning to ask you about the odd skeleton usually standing around in the courtyard. Old acquaintance of yours? A hireling, perhaps?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"That one, Skelly, was it? We only met when all this business of escape began. If I have a connection to him, I am unaware. Does he claim to know me? Perhaps I slew him when we were alive."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know that that's it. So neither of us has any idea where he's from or how he got there, huh. Can you think of any leads? Nyx doesn't seem to know him, either."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Perhaps the gods of Olympus sent him to your aid? Their methods can be odd. And, there are many who support you. Regardless, he does not appear to be your father's spy, if that is your concern."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Skelly 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Remember that Skelly character out in the courtyard, sir? Turns out he's been working with Charon all this time. Working for him more like! I had so much help in this, from all of you."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Charon! Of course. He has a stake in all that goes on in the Underworld. And he probably thinks highly of you. This Skelly character, though... he must have been somebody if Charon's confided in him."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He won't tell me. He was either a venerable sea captain, or a petty thief. Maybe both?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Nyx 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"In my recent audience with Nyx, lad, she let on that you have mentioned Chaos as of late. Is it true you've met her parent, yourself?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have. Chaos is... not like anyone I've ever met. At first I was a little worried, meeting this vast primordial entity apparently responsible for all creation, but... they seem all right. Chaos and Nyx haven't been talking for a while, though. You don't know what happened there, do you?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I know a little bit, I think. Nyx, she and Chaos, they just... slowly drifted apart. No animosity, not anymore, at least. It happens between parents and children. And once such ties are severed, they cannot always be restored. Especially among primordial gods as old as time, I suppose."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Nyx 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wanted to ask you more about Nyx and Chaos, sir. So they just drifted apart, I mean... why not just keep in touch? I don't understand. How hard is it just to say hello from time to time?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"It can be harder than you know. For someone like Nyx... she was responsible for no small part of creation, herself. As her relationship with Chaos grew more strained, she gave birth to Strife, Misery, Doom... sons and daughters you don't hear about too much."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, really? I've never heard Hypnos or Thanatos mention any of them, let alone Nyx. They sound like a handful. Where are they, what happened?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I don't know, lad. On the surface, I suppose? My point is, Nyx had her own problems to contend with. Dealing with her brood, governing the Underworld all on her own before your father arrived. Her relationship with Chaos suffered for it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Lad, I heard from Nyx! She said that she was able recently to reestablish contact with Chaos, thanks to you? You're just full of surprises, reforging old bonds between primordial gods like it was nothing."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, just took a bit of tampering with the Sigil in the admin chamber. Whole bunch of Darkness, too. But I could tell that Nyx and Chaos, they... seemed to really miss each other, to the extent they are able to miss anybody."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I think they're plenty capable of missing their loved ones, lad. The amount of time that either of us have existed... it's nothing compared to either of them. Imagine, being apart from someone you care about, for that long..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Theseus Extreme Measures 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir? You happen to know whether Father authorized the transfer of a Macedonian Tau-Lambda chariot to Elysium in recent memory? I ran into the former hero Theseus, all joyriding about in one of those."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I know the chariot you mean. It's not just any Macedonian. It's modified, apparently by Daedalus, himself. No earthly weapons can do what it does. Though, please don't tell me Theseus put on that mask...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you mean the golden matching mask? I saw him wearing it, all right. Looked like a proper fool, I thought. What of it, though?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Hahah'', well! I think that Daedalus would certainly agree. Heard that he fashioned that mask and outfit as a little joke. For someone deeply prideful, and well unaware. It must have suited Theseus quite well, then, yes?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Weapon Enchantments 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, wanted to ask you more about the weapons I've been using. They can change shape! So, they've molded themselves to suit me, and remember their past wielders, something like that?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Something like that. They seem alive, don't they? Taking everything in. I think they long predate even your father's time. Some have seen many different owners. Chances are, you shall not be the last."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"As you may know, lad, I've a connection to the weapons that you use, having once wielded one of them myself. Of course not knowing its significance back then, but I digress. Sometimes, it... well, it keeps in touch. And I've a vision from it to impart."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you mean a vision from Varatha the Eternal Spear? That's... out of the ordinary, and also a bit concerning. So, what did you see?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well... I saw a great, bearded warrior. Bigger than me, pitch-black hair. Bearing an aspect of Varatha unlike any with which I'm familiar. Then he was gone. But, what still lingered were these words: ''I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix''."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix''... I don't understand. What's that supposed to mean?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"There's one more thing. This was not my first such vision. Long ago... I saw one of Varatha's other bearers. It was ''you''. Your Infernal Arms... they must be weapons of the Fates' design. They know already who shall brandish them. Now they ask a favor. Seek Varatha. Speak the words. Go."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles...! Something awakened in Varatha when I spoke the words. It revealed to me a form I'd never seen. Wielded by the warrior called Guan Yu. Handsomely dressed! And just as you described. That's no Greek name, is it..."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"No, I don't think so, lad. I don't know who this Guan Yu is, or where he's from. Or even ''when ''he's from. But the Fates must have a plan for him, and you. Anyway... I think my part in this is ended. Varatha's served you well, no? I trusted it in life; I trust it now. Fear is for the weak."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Arthur Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir! I've uncovered the hidden aspect for Stygius! Nyx gave me the words this time, and a vision of a noble leader among mortals. An entire armored legion of them! Arthur was his name. ''Will be ''his name, I guess."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"A future leader among men, wielding that blade? The mysteries of the Infernal Arms run deep, don't they. Although it seems that you and Stygius formed quite a bond."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Rama Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Heart-Seeker. Lady Artemis herself told me the words, and... it seems Coronacht belonged to, maybe ''will ''belong to somebody called Rama. Peerless with the bow. Even among gods..."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Many lay claim to peerlessness with bows in my experience, there, lad, although... I'm not to judge a vision from an ancient weapon such as that. I hope this Rama shall use his weapon wisely when the time comes; same as you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Beowulf Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Shield of Chaos... thanks to Chaos, themself. Apparently someday it'll protect an armored warrior known as Beowulf from all sorts of dangers... even a dragon! Mortals don't stand much of a chance against those, do they?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Depends upon the dragon, I suppose. I've heard they differ all across the world. Though, that's a fascinating find, there, lad. This Beowulf... sounds like he'll find a way to make good use of all that protective gear. Always preferred mobility, myself, but then, to each his own."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Gilgamesh Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"The Bull of Minos led me to another hidden aspect, Achilles! A beastly form of the Twin Fists, belonging to an ancient god-king known as Gilgamesh. You ever hear that name? He had a half-beast friend, apparently. Like how Asterius is friend to Theseus."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Gilgamesh, you said...? That name isn't familiar to me, but... with these hidden aspects, there's bound to be a connection to the future, or the past. Say, why is the Bull of Minos aiding you? I thought he was one of your rivals barring passage from Elysium."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, he is. He's loyal through and through to Theseus, and never holds back when we fight. But he seems to be the respect-for-his-opponent type. Unlike his companion."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Lucifer Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I discovered the hidden aspect of the Adamant Rail, after Lord Zeus himself told me the waking-phrase. It's from a winged fellow by the name of Lucifer... apparently had a bit of a falling out with his lord father. Wonder how that worked out for him."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Huh''! Perhaps it's from a time even before the Olympians rebelled against the Titans. But I've never heard of any Lucifer, with or without wings. Suggests to me, perhaps that falling out of his did not work out so well."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Legendary Aspects 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, something I've been wondering... now that I've discovered all the hidden aspects of my weapons... as far as I know, anyway... I can't see any pattern there, at all. Guan Yu, Gilgamesh, Rama, and so on... any idea why them?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"To know for certain, I suppose you'd have to ask the Fates, themselves... and get an answer from them, too. I ask myself how come you found an aspect of mine, among them all. What made me so special, do you suppose?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You were a great warrior! Famous, in your time! It's no surprise to me at all the Fates chose you to have a stint with one of their world-altering weapons."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, that's just it! I was quite famous, yes. Infamous, perhaps, but no matter. Perhaps it's just that these weapons demand to make themselves known, above all. To leave a lasting impression in the hands of their wielders."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You think the Infernal Arms just want to be ''popular''? Have exciting stories told about them and whatnot?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Achilles Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I've had the opportunity to use your aspect of Varatha, sir. So, you once wielded it yourself? It... fills me with a hunger for battle even more so than usual. A bit of your fighting spirit, perhaps."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Be very wary of that spirit, lad. It was what brought me here before my time. Although that spear indeed once served me well. A parting gift from my old master Chiron. He cautioned me as I am cautioning you. Though, may you be a better listener."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Chiron Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I meant to ask, did you know that Coronacht the Heart-Seeker once belonged to the centaur, Chiron? Because one of its aspects is his own. He didn't have it back when you trained with him, did he...?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Master Chiron, truly...? Ah, of course. He granted me a spear, I think you know. If he possessed one such weapon, why not more? I remember his bow shined like the sun. It was splendid, and never missed its mark... though I attributed that to Chiron's extraordinary skill."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Mirror 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I have to thank you for the mirror back there, lad. Lets me get a better look at things out in the great hall every now and then."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Of course, sir, don't mention it. You're really stuck having to guard this corridor most of the time, huh?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh certainly, it's an important corridor! Think of it, if just any shade could pass through either of those doors back there. Your father's barely keeping it together, as it is."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Warrior Statue 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Quite a statue you commissioned over there. I suppose I can think of worse subjects than mighty Heracles for me to have to stand about and stare at."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"They say he was the strongest demigod who ever lived. Though, I bet you could take him, sir. Big guy like that, you'd be too quick, I'm sure. You ever meet him?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Only in passing. He once died a mortal's death... worse than mine. Had a brief stint down here, but... he's favored by Olympus. Got a special arrangement of some sort, I heard. Haven't seen him since."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Office Backstory 01

|"Achilles, looks like I could buy back my right to go in the administrative chamber, there. I never want to go in there again, but... can you think of any reason whatsoever that I should?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Hah'', well. Perhaps we all want what we cannot have. Other than that, I suppose certain documents or records in there could be of some benefit under the circumstances, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Legendary 01

|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Vs Hades 01

|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I... sometimes I fear that Father, if he learns that you've been aiding me, that he will... not be generous with you."

|"Don't worry about me, lad. Your father's still getting caught up with work that I created for him in my mortal days. Besides... there's nothing he can take from me. We have a mutual arrangement, he and I."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Vs Hades 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I'm concerned that Father's growing angrier with you. He thinks you've taken sides against him in all this. I don't want anything to happen."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"He's right, lad. I have taken sides. But, as for you not wanting anything to happen... while I know what you meant, I don't want you to say such things again. Do you understand? You're doing this because something here ''needs ''to happen. Hold back your fear."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Vs Aphrodite 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wanted to say, the Lady Aphrodite asked that I relay a message to you, sir. She said that she admires you. Mentioned a certain war."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Admires me, does she? Sometimes, lad, I think that Aphrodite is the mightiest of all the gods. Her power is what spurs us all to action. Whether to love, or war. Or sometimes both the two. I'm grateful for the message."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Vs Artemis 01

|"Hey, Achilles! I heard from Lady Artemis out there. It seems you have a bit of a fan in her. She wanted me to tell you you're the best! She's not mistaken, by the way."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"The goddess of the hunt herself said that? That's very flattering to hear. Good thing she doesn't know I'm all washed up, by now. Her memory is of my glory days."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Daedalus 01

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I've never met him, no. Your father keeps him fully occupied with building out his Underworld, and renovating constantly. No wonder some of his old crafting-tools are strewn about. I take it you've been able to make use of them?"
|-

|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, it's just... I met the goddess Demeter out there. The blessings that she offered, they... just drained the heat and life from everything. I thought she saw to fruits and grains and vegetables and such? Not that I'm complaining."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"All gods and goddesses are to be feared. Demeter, she has the power to give life, or take it. Seems she's more interested in the latter, though. She's the eldest on Olympus, and your father seems to harbor a particular dislike for her. I don't know why. Be careful."

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Nyx cut her off, lad. I'm sorry. I know you cared about her. I was as surprised as you when I found out. I knew that Nyx had her concerns about Dusa's propensity to overwork herself, but... this wasn't the step I was expecting."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Propensity to overwork herself... you really think that's what this was about? I can't shake the feeling it's my fault. Nyx didn't want her talking to me, as though she's beneath me or something! ''Ugh'', what am I going to do."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Look... I don't have all the information on this one, and neither do you from the sound of things. Nyx loves you and respects you. I trust she would want to know how this affects you."

|"I did, Achilles. It's crawling with great warriors still looking for a fight. It's not exactly what I was expecting."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Your father's marshalled the most willing ones to deal with you. Doubtless there's much at stake in it for them, if but the pride of having done the task. Although I think that pride will always be their weakness."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, it's just... I've never slain a living creature, sir. Until my recent journey to the Temple up above. I know they're just Satyrs and vermin, but... it's not the same as sending wretches to the depths."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Look. All mortal life is fragile; it simply is a struggle to survive. Sooner or later it fails to succeed, and then, it ends up here. And we have room enough for everyone, even the Satyrs and the vermin of the world."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Now that you mention it, I have to say I'm glad we can accommodate all former-living things. And at least mortals get to rest assured knowing what happens once they die! Must really ease the mind."

|"Well, at least I know who will be waiting for me the next time I climb all the way to the Temple of Styx and manage my way out."

|"So, you can tell me in due time if you decide to, lad. But I do have a question, same as you did, going into this. Why did she leave? Why did she leave ''you'', in particular?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's that she didn't even know I was alive. Sounds as though Nyx revived me sometime after I was born, but by that point... Mother had already left, and... they let her be. For reasons I am trying to find out."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Ah, that's... quite a bit to take in, there. And it explains more than a bit, I think. Look, I'm not one to speculate too much. I trust you'll find the answers that you seek as you proceed."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, I failed, sir. No thanks to Father! ''Urgh'', what am I going to do?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Just take it easy, now. You got there once, there isn't any question in my mind that you can do it once again. Your father's acting as though nothing's changed, besides. So, don't lose hope. You're capable of this."
|-

|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, tell me something, sir. Any rumors swirling about the House regarding the outcome of a certain interaction I had with my father recently? Involving a great deal of violence? Because I'd like for everyone to know: I won."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I wouldn't know of what you mean, there, lad. For there are certain subjects so forbidden here right now that not even rumors can take hold. But, just between us for the time: Congratulations. Truly."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you, sir. I didn't know whether I had it in me. As for the other bit, I'll keep it quiet, then, for now. I probably shouldn't be tying my sense of self-worth to praise from friends, acquaintances, and strangers, anyway."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's so, indeed, sir. Especially for now, at least, I'm going to keep on fighting to the surface. Helps me to vent a bit, and, like Hypnos says, it makes the Underworld a better place! Though indirectly, I suppose."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, then, I look forward to working with you in a more formal capacity. And, it is my sincerest hope that you, your mother, and your father learn to get on better with each other, now."

|-

|"Think nothing of it, lad. It was a risk I was willing to take, and for his part, your father looked the other way on that one. Though I did not expect you'd get free rein to go there as you please."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"So, lad, tell me, then. How went the family feast, was everything all right?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, I confess I was perhaps a little nervous for practically the entire thing, but... all in all, I had a good time, and I'm very, very glad it all turned out the way it did. How about yourself?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I quite enjoyed it, too. Last time I was invited to a feast, I was still busy warring on the surface, that's how long it's been. I must say, your mother is quite good with words! Had everybody chatting, laughing..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She really pulled it off! But... for all her confidence, I don't think she knew she had it in her. Because if she did... if she reached out to Olympus sooner... a lot of things could have been different."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Don't dwell on that. I spoke a bit with Nyx. Your mother had her reasons. No one gets to act on perfect information, right? All we have is what we think we know, and what our conscience tells us. Your mother got to where all this was possible... all thanks to you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"All thanks to me, sir? I had ample help along the way. For instance, I could not have done it without ''you''. Would have been using an old chair leg as a weapon, I suppose."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"And what a fearsome chair leg it would be! In any case... you heading out there, soon? Olympus should be more than happy to assist in your security review. If that's what we're calling it now."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah, I should go. I'll see you not too long from now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Post Epilogue 02
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I'm so impressed with what you've managed to accomplish, lad. When I was closer to your age... or, the age you appear to be... all I wanted was glory. To be remembered forever. Look where that got me! I'm glad you know better than I did."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So in pursuing glory... you think you lost it? Forgive me, here, but I just disagree. I settled a family squabble. You single-handedly turned an entire war!"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"A foolish war. Glory comes to those driven to excel in worthwhile pursuits. A happy side effect, not a goal unto itself. Though, you don't need for me to tell you that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"If not for all your training and advice, I wouldn't have come this far. You prepared me for this. Wasn't that a worthwhile pursuit? Must mean you got some glory after all, then, right?"
|-

|'''Achilles'''
|"You're getting somewhere with that Codex, lad. I'm pleased to see it. My duties to the House have meant that, lately, I can't travel quite as much as once I did."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'll try to travel for the both of us, Achilles. I've seen so little other than these walls."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Codex Progress 02
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, look at you, lad, with that Codex brimming with our history! I knew I could rely on you to fill it out. Back when I was alive, why, no one would have ever believed what goes on down here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mortals must have had their stories, though. About what happens to them once they die, and once they end up in this place."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"They have their stories, definitely so. They fear your father, understandably. They also fear your dog. But most of them know precious little else. Even their fears, I think, are born of ignorance. As most fears tend to be."
|-

|"Achilles, sir... within the Codex, you'd written something, about someone with whom you shared your life... when you were flesh and blood?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...''Ah''. That is a private matter for me, lad. From a time I had convinced myself the Codex would be for my own eyes, alone. My past is not really worth mentioning. And, I am presently on duty, so... begging your pardon, please."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Codex Progress 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Achilles sir, there's something I've been wondering, about your Codex. The words are yours, and yet it's through my actions that I'm able to absorb them. Is that how mortal scriptures always work?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Ah''. You have to understand, lad, I've been here in your father's realm for quite some time. My documented learnings became bound to me, much like this spear, you see? You can undo those bindings over time. Thus my knowledge can be yours. Whatever it amounts to."

|-

|-

|"Then, surely he must be in the Underworld, somewhere... have you not tried to seek him out? Or asked my father?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Hah, haha. ''I tried, lad, I have tried. On both accounts. What you propose is not that simple, it turns out. You've seen what it is like out there... it's difficult to find one's way. But I shall tell you what. If you see Patroclus among the countless shades, you tell him I said hi."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I understand. What can I do about this, sir? There must be something. But, you have to let me know what's going on."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Simply put, he is the reason that I'm here. Patroclus lost his life before I did. Because of me. I shortly followed, in a rage. When I arrived here, I received a hero's welcome. Your father himself ushered me to Elysium. But that's not what I wanted."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You wanted to see Patroclus. But, he's in Elysium, while you... oh, no."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I signed a pact, lad. Felt that the terms were good enough. He could live there, while I'd live here, at least for now. Such deals are most uncommon, and their confidentiality must be upheld. But, let's speak no more of this for now, all right? Some other time."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Patroclus 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You have to tell me more about this pact you signed, Achilles. You and Patroclus... so, you're doomed to never be together, then?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You must safeguard the details of it, lad. Although it's not as bad as you make out. I ensured Patroclus is provided for. We wouldn't have been together anyway. Initially he wasn't sent into Elysium, you see."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"There has to be a way for me to make this right. Not just for him, for you."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You've other, pressing matters to attend to, lad. And Patroclus and I have ample time to wait this out. I know you mean well, but... do not discuss this matter with your father, now. I fear that it could make things worse. Do you understand?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Patroclus 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"The... fallen warrior in Elysium we spoke of. He seems like a good man, though... was he always the despondent sort?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"No, lad. I was that sort, I think, but he was not. He was... one of the only men I knew who did not look upon me as a threat. He saw something in me I never knew was there. And in turn, with him, I felt... how to describe it? Calm. Whole."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Hah''! I'm restless all the time. I can only imagine."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"He had this wry humor about him. Like he was wise beyond his years. A quality I trust shall see him through his struggles now. Although... I hoped residing in Elysium would mean he wouldn't have to struggle any longer."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I know that it's a painful subject, sir, but can you tell me... what exactly happened, in the war that claimed Patroclus and yourself? He brought it up. Said you refused to fight."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Until he died. I did refuse to fight, until he died, but at that point... ''ungh'', look, lad, if we're going to discuss these matters, best we do so in the lounge, not here."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...The fool of a king I served... I'd never take up arms, for him. But, Patroclus, he always had a different way of looking at things. As I refused to fight, he rose to the occasion. Took up my armor, led my brothers into battle, in my guise. Fought nobly... but then, he... well."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And after you found out... you sought vengeance for him. Took vengeance."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"That I did. They got me, finally, of course. But, not before I broke them, first. The war soon ended, after that. It is an awful contradiction, that to quickly end war, one need only extinguish many lives at once. I had not realized it at the time."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Did you... allow yourself to die? So that you could see Patroclus again, here?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...I don't know. Maybe. I only know that I was filled with rage. Rage that subsided, soon after I arrived here. I felt... empty. I never saw Patroclus again. But, I learned my brothers honored my last request, as my ashes were laid to rest with his. ''<Sigh> ''Anyway...! Appreciate the drink."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Suppose I'd best be getting back to standing quietly about. Though, that war, lad? Don't ask me about it again. All right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Patroclus 05
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"How is he, anyway, if you've encountered him of late during your journeys, lad? The fallen warrior you've run into in Elysium, that is."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He's doing relatively well, I think. There's a lot you've told me... that he didn't know. About what led up to his present circumstances, and your own."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You told him, then. Without requesting my consent to tell him, first! What, exactly, did you say to him?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I... I'm sorry, I... just told him about your ashes being intermingled, that whole thing? And about the pact. You told me once to send him your love and regards! This brought him no joy, only questions! You told me not to speak to Father, not to him!"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''<Sigh>''...You're right, I... should have specified. Or shouldn't have. Because what you said, probably is for the best. I didn't mean to lose my temper with you, lad, it's just... look, thank you for looking out for him. For both of us. Just, please be careful."

|"Say, I was wondering, Achilles. Any news of Orpheus of late? I've not seen him around here in some time. He still paying his dues?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"That I believe he is, lad. Your father, he was none too pleased with him last time I saw him here. I tried my best to simmer down the situation, but... you know how it goes. I hope your father cuts his sentence short."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I hope so, too. If you do see him, tell him I said hi."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Good to see old Orpheus is back with us. He hasn't changed a bit. Was he always like this?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I'm guessing not. Never knew him when we were alive, but since we met he's always been the melancholy sort. The few times I heard him sing, though...? It was beautiful. I'm not surprised your father's kept him here."
|-

|"Hey Achilles, look this really isn't much, but... here."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"This really is for me? You beat me to it, then, as I had meant to give you this when next we spoke. Please, take it."
|-

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"No, this is for me? You really shouldn't have. You're spoiling me rotten...!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I just happen to think you deserve better than you've got down here, Achilles."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 03
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"What, for me...? I can't accept something like this, lad, you know that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Come on, Achilles, live a little... such as you're able. I won't tell if you won't tell."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 04 A
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Ah'', now this is something, lad! I'd hate to think that you've returned to bring me this just for my sake. Though I'm grateful, really."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You've always been there for me, Achilles. Even when Father pushed me away. This is nothing. I don't think I can ever repay you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 05 A
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Lad, all this generosity, I... don't want you to get the wrong idea. I am alone, yes, but my heart belongs to another. Ever since I was alive. I hope you understand."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I... somehow knew that was the case, Achilles. I wanted you to have this, anyway, just... don't drown your sorrows, as they seem to make you stronger."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Thank you, then, and do not worry about me. I am long since past my sorrow, and the rage I felt when first my heart was broken. Now it's but another scar. They say it's our scars that give us character."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 05 B
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Lad, all this generosity, I... I'm just an old killer, yet you treat me like I'm the one who's royalty around here. That's about the last thing I would have expected when first I set foot in this House."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You were a great hero, Achilles, and guess what? You still are! And always will be if you ask me. You deserve so much better than just this. I wish there was more that I could do."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Thank you, then, and do not worry about me. I'm fortunate to be here, and besides... a teacher couldn't have asked for a better pupil."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 06 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I was wondering if you'd split this with me at the lounge. A small excuse for both ourselves to take a break?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Are you most certain you have time for me now, lad...? Though, how could I decline. I'll see you there."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...I was a fool, you see. The gods promised me eternal glory beyond death. I could have stayed out of the war. Stayed home with Patroclus. I threw everything away. And sent so very many to this place."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What's done is done, sir. In my mind you're the greatest warrior who ever lived. So is it glory you still seek, or is it Patroclus?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"It isn't glory anymore, lad. I'm sure of that. Patroclus, however, I... fear he's gone to me, forever. Although his shade might yet reside within this realm, we left on terms I'd not forgive if I were him. Though... I had better get back to my post now, I think."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...I hope I didn't cast a greater pall over this place back there. I'm very thankful that we had this chance to get caught up. Now you had best be off! Take care out there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 07 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, next time you're in Elysium, I thought this might be something you'd enjoy. That you might share."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Ambrosia... well I am honored, lad, truly. Although it's I who ought to be bestowing thoughtful gifts upon you, for what you've done for me, not the other way around. And, I happen to have one here, on Pat's and my behalf."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 08 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's hard to think of anybody more deserving of this than you, sir. So when next you are off duty, or whenever the occasion warrants, please, enjoy, all right?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I suppose this must be what it's like to be a god, lad. Being shown affection such as this. And getting offerings! Are you quite sure?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, I'm absolutely positive. I would never have been remotely prepared for everything I've had to face, if not for all your guidance. And, I don't just mean the violent stuff."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Come now, lad. Admittedly I was quite good at it, but I was nothing other than a killer. I would be wary of all my advice, if I were you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"See, that's why you give such good advice, right there!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 09 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Here, sir! To you, and to Patroclus. May the remainder of eternity more than make up for everything it took for you to come this far."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, thank you, lad. Prince. Zagreus. You really oughtn't have. In fact, I shall accept this from you once again, but not a bottle more."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Really? I mean... I meant no offense, of course, it's just... I thought you enjoyed this stuff, no?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"We do enjoy it, quite a bit, in fact. But in Elysium... it's something to be earned more than accepted, and, well... perhaps in being there, a bit of our old pride is coming back."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, good. You have much to be proud of, Achilles. You're a great warrior. A great instructor. A great friend."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...If, indeed, I've something to be proud of, lad... it's that someone such as you can say a thing like that to me, and mean it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 04
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"My word. How very kind of you to think of me with that there, lad."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Least I can do for all your guidance, sir."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Gift 07
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I'm going to be the envy of the House with this, I thank you, lad. I hope you wouldn't mind if I shared some of it around?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's yours, Achilles! Though not only do I hope you'll share it, why, I practically insist."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx First Meeting
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Do not despair, child. Such setbacks are inevitable, and may be overcome with effort, and with time. You made contact with the goddess Athena. She shall be true to her word."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I believe it, Nyx. I'm grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The risk is not to me. I expected the Olympians would involve themselves in this, eventually. Reveal to them no more than they already know. Are we understood?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx First Meeting B
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"It pleases me to speak with you at last, child. So the goddess Athena was true to her word. You and she were wise to use discretion in your task."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I believe it, Nyx. I'm grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out."
|-

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I trust that the Mirror in your bedchamber has proved satisfactory, dear child...?"
|-

|"Better than I could have possibly imagined, Nyx. You mentioned there was something more that it could do, once I had grown accustomed. I think I'm ready for that now."

|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, this may be an odd question, but... do you know what the Fates may have in store for me? They are your daughters, right?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The Three Fates are my daughters, yes, my child. However, I am no more privy to their workings than the naive mortals living up above. Not even the Olympians can know the weavings of the Fates."
|-

|"I won't forget you, Nyx. I swear it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx Backstory 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Somehow, I always knew. You know... that you were not my birthmother. I mean, look at Hypnos and Thanatos. There's no way that I could have been related to ''them'', everybody knew, and yet... when I finally learned for certain, it was still a shock."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I always knew, in turn, that you would learn the truth of it, eventually. And I was fearful of what would occur after that time arrived. I'm grateful it has come and gone. Though, tell me. I still find I call you child. Is your preference that I cease to use such terms, from this point on?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, Nyx, please, it's... quite all right. You may not have given birth to me, but you still cared for me. I never doubt that. Likewise, are you sure it's all right that I continue to address you by name?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx Backstory 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, you must know something about why Father broke off ties with the Olympians, don't you?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"That is a question only your father can answer, child. I cannot tell you more than you already know."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Hades 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have to ask you something, Nyx. What is this debt you owe my father, anyway? Forgive my eavesdropping, it's just, I heard the two of you discussing things, and... it came up."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"...I was here long before your father. The responsibility to govern fell to me. Yet, I could not manage on my own. I shape the darkness; ensure the integrity of the domain. I am less prone to census-taking and administering rules. I receded from such responsibilities."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It was too much, even for you. So... when father arrived... you welcomed him? He helped?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I was quite skeptical of him, at first. I thought his presence merely a cruel trick of Fate. But... he worked diligently, from the start. Soon there was order where once there was none. I fashioned this House for him, and I maintain it still. We remain in partnership. In interdependency."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He has never taken advantage of you? Of your generosity?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"No, child. He has not. He can be short with me, as you have seen. But that is the extent of it. We have found ways to reconcile disagreements. Though, your relationship with him... it is more complicated than my own, I fear..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Hades 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, all you've done to help me, with the Olympians, the Mirror, the House Contractor, I... I worry that if Father were to know, that he would turn his wrath upon you. I don't want anything to happen."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You need not fear for me, my child. For I am not some underling your father has authority to punish if it pleases him. I am the Night; and it is by my grace that this House stands. Your father knows this. Thus, he and I have certain common goals. We are obligated to cooperate."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Then... if there's really nothing he can do, why go along with his deception? About my birthmother, I mean?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Please... that is something I am not at liberty to say. When you meet your birthmother eventually... you shall understand."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Hades 02 B

|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Athena 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I heard lately from the goddess Athena, Nyx. She seems to admire you. I thought Olympians didn't like our kind?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"They typically do not. But, you are family, child. And I, why... I believed Athena wise enough to understand why someone such as I would seek her, in particular. She has, in turn, made others in her family aware."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Athena 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Athena sends you her kindest regards, Nyx. Sounds like you have maintained some correspondence since all this began?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"We have, thank you, my child. Goddess Athena is reputed to be wise, and so she was the one I felt was the most likely to listen to reason, understand my view, and ultimately have a willingness to help. It is most fortunate that I was not mistaken about her."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But... you told her you're my mother. If she's supposedly so wise... isn't that quite a risk? If she finds out you've been misleading her..."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"She ''is ''wise, child. It is precisely for that reason I expected she would understand."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Ares 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Nyx, at first I thought I maybe should ignore this, but I wanted to give you greetings from Lord Ares, who seems rather interested in you."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"''Ah'', yes, the god of war. Among all the Olympians, he often struck me as much more accepting of our kind, born of the Underworld."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're not... wait, you're not interested in him, I mean, he's... murderous... polite, though, I don't know."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I take an interest in whomever I take interest in, my child. I thank you for the message."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Ares 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Nyx, ''erm'', Lord Ares wanted you to know, and I believe I quote, that '''I am often thinking of her here'''. Take that for what it's worth?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I shall, thank you, my child. If the god of war is thus preoccupied with me, well then, perhaps he shall be slower to send droves of mortals to our doorstep here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Ares 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Help me, Nyx. Or rather, help yourself. Lord Ares seeks for me to put the two of you in contact. I mean... I don't know why I'm getting so defensive, here, now that I think on it."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Do not concern yourself with my ability to navigate my interpersonal relationships, my child. It pleases me Lord Ares told you this. Those of Olympus rarely say such things, to any of us here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Ares 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, did you really start a ''correspondence ''with Lord Ares, as he put it to me recently? Is everything all right with you and him?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"His interest in the Underworld is genuine, and he does not regard me as beneath him, even if the technicality exists. The Olympians and the chthonic gods... we have much left to learn of one another's kind."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What of Father? He's forbidden any contact whatsoever!"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You have repeatedly received such contact, all despite your father's wishes, child."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Ares 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're going to meet Ares, sometime, Nyx? Or maybe you already have?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"What is your concern, exactly, child? Speak plain with me, or else take not my time."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, I... it's just, Ares, he's... I don't know, he just doesn't seem your type! And isn't he a little young for you?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You do not understand the basis of our friendship, child. Lord Ares may not meet the moral standard of the mortals who hate him, or Olympians who shun him, but to me? He is cordial and eager to learn. I am quite capable of forming my own views on him."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Ares 06
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Nyx, I... Ares sends you his regards again. Wanted to let you know."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Thank you, my child. We may seldom have occasion to encounter one another, he and I, but it is good to have another friend upon Olympus. Even if goddess Athena and he are not on the best of terms."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Boons 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"The Olympians can't really see me, can they, Nyx? I mean, not very well. I get that they can sense details here and there, but... they don't know the full extent of what's going on. Are we really so far beyond their influence?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You are enshrouded from them, child. For your own benefit, and theirs. They know as much as necessary to assist. And I trust they shall, for as long as you require. They are bound to one another as family. And they know that you require aid. Do not be too prideful to accept."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Orpheus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I was pleased to see an order pending approval for the release of Orpheus with the House Contractor, Nyx. If Father wants him to start singing again, locking him in Tartarus doesn't seem like the most efficient way to go about it. Besides, I think he's suffered enough."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Your father found a certain peace from song, my child. Perhaps with this reprieve, our Orpheus shall reconsider and resume his craft."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're worried Father doesn't have enough live music to enjoy while brooding over his gloomy court?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Your father's temperament is easier to navigate when he is in relatively better spirits. And my opinion is that punishing the court musician does not further your father's goal with him."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Orpheus 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Do you enjoy Orpheus' singing, Nyx? He seems a bit concerned that you might not."
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Skelly 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't suppose the name ''Skelly ''happens to mean anything to you, does it, Nyx?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"It means nothing to me at all, my child. Though, why do you invoke such names within this House? Who is this Skelly, and what do you presume is the connection that exists between us?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Oh'', I... well, essentially, he is an animated skeleton who shows up just outside my bedchambers, and lets me practice with my weapons on him. I sort of figured that ''you ''put him up to it. So it wasn't you?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Achilles moves throughout these chambers under my own shroud, if you must know. And thus you have in your possession the Infernal Arms. But, I have not exerted further influence than that. Is this skeleton to be trusted, then?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx Run Not Cleared 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I finally made it to the surface, Nyx! Confronted Father, there, out in the cold. I couldn't make it past him, but... I was so close!"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Do not despair, as I told you before. With effort and with time, most any setback can be overcome. Even your father. You have come closer to your goal. Achieve it!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx Run Not Cleared 02
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Your father is not here, and you are back. Then, it can only mean one thing. Are you all right, my child?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes, I think so, Nyx. Returning here by Father's hand does put a special sting into it, though. So, any invaluable tips on how to vanquish him? Some hidden weaknesses only you know about, something like that?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You know his weaknesses better than anyone. Better even than he. It pains me to know that the conflict between you could not be settled in some other way. But if this is how it has to be... destroy him for me, next you fight up there. However long it takes. Would you do that?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Pact 01
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You have been served a Pact of Punishment, now, child. I thought to talk your father out of it, at first, but... it may serve to let you grow your power, even more."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Something about setbacks building character, I guess? I didn't take you for someone to look on the bright side of things, Nyx."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"It is a point of fact. If you can overcome the conditions of the Pact, your influence throughout this realm shall surely grow. Though, do not overextend, of course."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Flowers 01
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I thank you for the lovely flowers, child. They make my corner of the House hospitable. Such simple comforts never were for me, and yet... now that I am surrounded by them, I have found that I enjoy their presence, more than I would have admitted in the past."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm glad you like them, Nyx. Though if you don't, just give the word, and I will have them removed. Probably incinerated for good measure! Now that you mention it, though, how come you are always in this corner in particular?"
|-

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"How very forward of you, child. I accept your compliment. Although, I am the Night, as you observe. The night conceals all. I know nothing of the loneliness which you describe. This entire realm... it is a part of me. And many of its subjects sprang from me, alone."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx Darkness Progress 04
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Even among those born longest ago within the deepest reaches of the Underworld... I have seldom encountered anyone so united with the Darkness of this domain as you are, child."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"United with the Darkness? I've just... been picking it up here and there. Although, for quite a while, since you mention it! I'm not sure that I feel any different, though."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Surely that is not so. Think back on when you started all of this. You now know so much more. Are capable of so much more."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx Mirror Progress Complete 01

|'''Nyx'''
|"You have revealed every facet of the Mirror of Night, child. The full extent of its power. I was aware this was possible, yet... you achieved it sooner than expected."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know where I'd be without it. Probably still in Tartarus trying to get past Meg. I only wish I could get even stronger."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The Mirror has little to do with your power, let alone your capability. You may deactivate its effects and see for yourself. It merely gave you greater opportunity to learn. And you shall continue to do so."

|"Nyx... I have to ask you something. Are you certain that my search isn't in vain? My mother, what if... what if she's gone?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Your mother yet lives. There can be no other explanation. For, if she did not, she would be with us, here.... She was a good woman. Stately, kind. I wished to raise you as I thought she would have."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, sometimes I get the impression the Olympians look down on those of us born of the Underworld. Is that my imagination, or, what do you make of it?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The gods of Mount Olympus tend to think themselves above us, child. Or so your father often likes to say. He alone was relegated to this realm, and grew resentful of his relatives on high."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"They all still think I'm headed to join them on Olympus. That's why they're helping me."
|-
|'''Nyx'''

|-

|"Nyx... the Olympians have been immensely helpful, but... did they really have to get mixed up in all this? I could have gone off on my own."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"And you would not have gone far, child. Your father is too proud to accept assistance in personal matters. Do not cede the advantage that you have."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But I'm misleading them. Taking advantage of their good graces trying to find Mother. What if they find out?"

|"Nyx, can you... tell me more about my birthmother? Anything at all. What was she like, when you first met? What did you think of her?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Your birthmother left a strong impression on us, child. It was apparent she was from a far-off place, and yet... she brought with her a lightness I had not experienced before. My first impression soon subsided, and I grew to care for her. You possess many of her finer qualities."

|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I did, I... she was there. She was... where you said she'd be. And, more than I imagined, but... I had so little time with her. I can't survive up there, for very long. Why didn't you tell me I'd just die, no matter what?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Oh, my child... I say this seldomly, but... I did not know. Or... I did not wish to believe... that the surface would have such an effect on you. But it seems you share your father's fate, after all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"My father's fate? But he is smugly waiting for me every single time I make it there, and seems quite healthy by then, all in all! Though... maybe the farther we get from this realm... the worse we get. Because he cast his lot... inheriting the Underworld?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"So I now presume. You are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine. Tell me something... if you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time... would you still make the journey to her, there?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...Yes. Yes, I would. I had so many questions left for her!"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She's doing well, I think. It's nice to visit her. Her residence is beautiful. A little home nestled amid the cold. All of these plants, in bloom! It's difficult even to describe. And very bright, as well."
|-

|"Nyx, my mother was quite concerned to learn Olympus has been aiding me. Did you... haven't you... put her in danger by involving them? Was there no other way?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"No. There was not. She has been in danger, all along. I concealed her, yes. Even from me. But, it is not enough. I do not think that you could have found her without the Olympians. And, if I did not reveal your existence to them... if they discovered who you are... it would be worse."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Ugh'', what a mess. How are we going to fix this?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The Olympians maintain belief that you are trying to reach them. I trust we can sustain this understanding for a long, long time. Perhaps not forever, but... long enough to discover a solution. Perhaps with your birthmother's help."
|-

|"Child, quickly now, before you go. I know how all of this must look. Know that I was true to her. Persephone. And, that I think fondly on the time she spent with us."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Of course, Nyx, though... why did she really leave the Underworld, do you think? Besides because of me. So what if she thought I died at birth?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"She did not feel that she belonged. It was a very difficult adjustment she was forced to make. And... she feared that she would inevitably end up caught between Olympus and this realm. That she might start a war."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"A war... wars have been fought for less, I understand. And, Father must have been a real burden, too."

|-

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Your father was different with Persephone, to some extent. He has always been as you know him, yet... her lightness... it affected even him, I think. And he knows... that he was better with her, than without."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sounds like a lot of pressure on Mother to fix all his failings... but, it sounds as though she cared for him, as well. And you, and Cerberus. She said she misses you."

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"This realm remains enshrouded and obscure by my design and by your father's will, my child. Tell me, what would be the benefit of the attention you would seek?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, I... I don't know, it's just, for all the famous gods and monsters and the like, it seems to me that someone such as you, who does so much, why... you should be at least as known as any one of them!"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Obscurity is not a weakness, child. Are we understood? Seek to be valuable, not to be known. If you are valuable, then fame or notoriety can be a consequence. Should they become a burden... I can help."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You offer something called the ''Fated List of Minor Prophecies ''to me, chances are I'm going to pick it up. Though, you make it sound like there's more I should know about it. Should I be concerned?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''

|"You have fulfilled already many prophecies envisioned by my daughters, child. Although perhaps inevitable, I find it impressive, nonetheless."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you, Nyx. Though, they're just ''minor ''prophecies, right? The kind that won't necessarily come to pass unless spelled out and coupled with a decent reward to make it worth my while. Not even the Fates are above greasing the wheels of progress, then?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The Fates have perfect knowledge of exactly what is necessary for the future they have woven to someday come to pass. We each are instrumental to their ultimate design. Some more than others, it would seem, of course."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Quest Log 03
|-

|"I sense all of the minor prophecies described within the Fated List have been fulfilled...? I do not understand how that is possible."
|-

|"Well, it certainly took some doing, and several of those really were rather difficult, and took some time, but... what's so special about getting through them all? It's a list, right?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The Fates are always at their weaving. To have caught up with their designs... well, I should think that they shall have to learn to weave a little faster, perhaps."

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Now that you have regained your access privileges to the administrative chamber, child, yes; that is a level of authority you hypothetically possess, again."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But how can I possibly find anything in there? The place is wall-to-wall pacts and parchments. I've no idea where to look."
|-

|"Never thought that the administrative chamber would have been so invaluable, Nyx. Though, I have you to thank for all of it."

|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Demeter 01

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"...Listen to me, child. What you know, or do not know, is for your protection. Your protection, and your birthmother's, as well. Your suspicion and your curiosity are warranted. But I can do no more about them, now, except to caution you. Are we understood?"

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Lord Hermes is a point of contact, yes. Among Olympians he works the closest with our operations here, and aids with shepherding the souls of the departed to our gates. Accept his help; for he is faithful to our cause."

|"No. They are required elsewhere. It is for the best. Some of my children are not on speaking terms with one another, or with me. As a mother... one has her victories, and her defeats."

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"He has offered you aid, repeatedly. At first I saw it for a brazen act of bribery, but... try as I might, there was no deeper underpinning to his actions that I could detect. That is to say... the records you seek may be found in section sigma-phi-alpha, lower gamma folder."
|-

|-

|"I waived the punishment-sentence for Sisyphus the knave-king, Nyx, except... he chose to stay! He chose to stay, in Tartarus, I think in part because he likes getting to speak with me, from time to time! Also his boulder friend."

|"There can be no escape. Your father wishes that this reputation spread. So that the mortals and the shades never attempt what you were able to achieve."

|"A memorable night it was, indeed, Nyx! For most of us, at least. Dionysus, he won't remember any of it, I don't think. But, it was really good to see everyone having a good time. Getting along as though they didn't hold a grudge! So, then, we're clear, I think?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That means a lot to me, Nyx. Though I never could have done any of this without your help. Even after I lashed out at you after I learned the truth about Mother, you never stopped caring for me... and you put yourself directly in harm's way, defying Father's will. Why do all that, for me?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I am eternally committed to this House. Long before your father came to rule, I was already here. When he arrived... I needed to do everything I could to keep order, and establish with Lord Hades an agreeable relationship. But, there is one more reason, besides that..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"To get on better terms with the Olympians. They always used to frown on the Underworld, but... now that they know us, they seem much more willing to get involved and help with things."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"A reasonable guess, and not without some truth to it, but no, my child. My reason for helping you is simpler than that. It is because I love you. You may not be born of me, but I raised you like one of my own. And I have cared for you as I am capable."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Nyx? You don't suppose Charon would hold it against me if... we had a little fight? To the death, I mean."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"None of Charon's brothers ever dared fight with him whilst growing up. Why would you fathom such a ruinous idea, child?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It... kind of already happened. And, I can confirm he's rather strong. Something I can do to make it up to him?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Probably not. For it is unnecessary. Likely he appreciates having an adversary, in his own way. Few would so much as dare."

|"You must have vanquished Megaera, my child, for she has been sulking in the lounge for quite some time. You are safe here from her whip, but not her words."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'd better talk to her. Thank you for the heads-up, Nyx. See you later, I'm sure."

! colspan="2" |Nyx About Chaos 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, do you know anything about a softly-spoken gentlebeing under the guise of Chaos? They approached me recently, and offered me a Boon, of sorts."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Primordial Chaos... indeed, I know them well. They must have taken interest in your quest. I would advise that you beware their offerings, though know that Chaos, whilst a trickster, is not a deceiver."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Chaos 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Can you tell me something more of Chaos, Nyx? I... have a lot of questions."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"My place is not to speak too openly of Chaos, child. It is their own prerogative to tell you of themselves. I can say they are the eldest force within this world. Before them, there was nothing."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Chaos 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Chaos seems to have taken somewhat of a liking to me, Nyx. They mentioned you."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"They mentioned me, did they... I thought, perhaps, that they had long forgotten. You should know they are my mother and my father, child. We have not spoken since the dawn of time."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Chaos 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, I hate to be a bother, but I wanted to ask you about Chaos once again. Won't you at least try to reach out to them?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"It is for Chaos to reach out to me if they wish to reacquaint themselves with me. Child, it would please me if we spoke no more of this for now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Chaos 05
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Child, I... know not exactly what you did, but... I detected faintly an attempt by Chaos to reach out to me. A message, merely at the edges of my consciousness, yet I felt certain it was there. But I could not discern it, otherwise. What does Chaos want from me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I... think Chaos wishes to reestablish contact with you, Nyx. The two of you drifted apart from one another, so, I think I can imagine. I lost touch with Thanatos awhile! But that was nothing in comparison to this. Isn't there someway you can reconnect?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Now that the House is strong, and this realm orderly, I do not know. But I shall think upon it, child. Leave me, please."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Chaos 06
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I know what must be done, regarding Chaos and myself, my child. It is not often that I ask for your assistance, but I need for you to do something for me, if you would hear me out."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Of course, Nyx. Anything. What can I do?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"In the administrative chamber, you perhaps recall the Eldest Sigil there. Through it we have access directly to the darkest reaches of the realm. But not to Chaos, anymore. Not currently. Though, this is solvable, I think."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, the Sigil? But I'm not authorized to use it. It's never worked for me, and I have even less authority around here now."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"That you were stripped of your authority is what makes this possible at all. It shall require a significant expenditure of Darkness. Then... the bridge to Chaos may be restored. So that I might travel again to visit them. Will you bring Darkness to the Sigil for me, please? When possible."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'll do everything I can. Hey maybe you can put in a request with the House Contractor for me? Make it official, right?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, you're back! So, how did things with Chaos go? Please tell me it went well?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"It did. It did go well, my child, I... appreciated having had a chance to reconnect with my great ancestor. Thanks to your generosity, to both of us. We had to make up for a great deal of lost time."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So what happens now? You're back on speaking terms, then... does it mean Chaos will stop by for a visit soon, something like that?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Chaos is comfortable in their realm. I may, however, visit every now and then. Keep them apprised of what unfolds up here. Beyond that... Chaos knows better than to exert too much influence upon this realm. Beyond having already formulated it, and everything."

|'''Zagreus'''
|"How are you and Chaos getting on, lately, Nyx? Sounds like they expected an awful lot from you before. That you should shine as bright as day, something like that? I can't imagine."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"To shine was never quite my strongest suit. During the dawn of creation, there was much to do. This place... all that you see around you... it was more my leaning. Chaos understands that better, now. As for me, the work helped me to know which limits I have."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What limits are those? You seem capable of anything. Probably even shining bright."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Come, child. We each have our limits."

|'''Nyx'''
|"The Fury Megaera is under orders to prevent your passage out of Tartarus, my child. Conflict between the two of you is unavoidable. It brings me pain to have to see you fight."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Don't say that, Nyx. Besides! Conflict between Megaera and me has always put the spark in our relationship. We're going to be fine."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Meg 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, you've known Megaera practically forever. Well, before my time at least, so could you... tell me more about what she was like, back then?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"''Ah-hahah''. I am pleased to see the two of you on better terms of late. Megaera always was as she appears. Dutiful and quite particular. Thoughtful and dependable. Respectful."
|-

|'''Nyx'''
|"It pleases me that you and Megaera have come to deeply understand each other, child. I must admit to you, it was my hope that you and she were capable of this result."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're pleased we're together, Nyx? I thought you'd be concerned that such relationships distract from work responsibilities and such. Although, I'm grateful to have your approval."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I have no fear that Megaera shall be distracted, child. Besides; such matters are more likely to inspire, and to spur greater accomplishment. Although, the greater sense of contentment tends to be a sufficient end unto itself."

|"You're happy Meg and I are friends now, Nyx? I appreciate it, certainly, though... I worry it might get in the way of Meg's ability to do her job."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I have no such fear for either one of you. You both are dedicated to your tasks. I trust your friendship can withstand your confrontations every now and then. For that is why the friendship blossomed, is it not?"
|-

|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx... I ran into Thanatos out there. He aided me, although I think he's rather upset. That I took off like this."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Thanatos is worried for you, child. I hope you understand whatever anger you may sense from him is not the feeling at the source. Please forgive his rudeness."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You and my son... it pleases me to see the two of you have grown so close of late. Thanatos has always led a solitary life. He never would complain of it, and yet... I know he yearned for closeness, in his way."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you, Nyx. I think we each have harbored feelings for each other for some time. We've finally been true about them."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Then, in this you each achieved what you desired. I ask that you take care of my dear son. I often fear that he shall work himself too hard."

|"It's difficult to find a friend down here. Though, I have always had a trusted one in Thanatos, and he in me. I think we have a better understanding of that now."

|"What is it, child? I sense that your concern is of a different nature than it usually is. Yet, it is veiled to me, somehow."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, it's just.... Please don't take this the wrong way, Nyx, but I was worried you were being rather harsh to Dusa. You asked her not to speak to me, at all?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I asked she mind her own responsibilities. I fear she forgets herself, in this House. Though you have an informal air... you are the Prince! The only son of the Lord Hades, Fate-appointed master of this realm. You shall have the company of gods. Not severed gorgon heads."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Pff''! If I'm so important, shouldn't ''I ''be the one to choose whom I get to interact with around here?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You do not fully know your place, my child. The gorgon-head most certainly does not know hers. Please focus on your task at hand, and leave her be."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Dusa 02
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"You are consorting with the severed gorgon head, my child. Despite my wishes that you maintain respectful distances between yourselves."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She's my friend, Nyx. Look... I love you very much, you know I do, except... you cannot choose my friends for me! I can't allow that. I know you don't trust her. Don't you trust me?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"...I do. Then, very well. But understand that your relationship with her does not preclude the need for her continual improvement with respect to her responsibilities."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Dusa 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What happened with Dusa, Nyx? You really fired her because she talked to me? She was my friend!"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"She was removed for insubordination, and repeated overextension and lack of proper judgment, child. Your affinity for her is the reason her removal was as amicable as it was."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Insubordination, and repeated lack of what? She worked harder than anyone here to keep the House neat and orderly! I'd thought you would have valued that!"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Her eagerness to please was to a fault. Perhaps your Olympian relatives require sacrifices, child, but this House requires efficiency, and nothing more."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Efficiency''... you know who you sound like right now, don't you, Nyx? I can't believe this."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"If you are bent on undermining my authority, go do so someplace else."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Dusa 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx... I'm sorry that I raised my voice with you before, it's just... I cared about Dusa, and I know just how much she cared about working here, with you, and all of us... isn't there some way you would reconsider letting her go?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I appreciate that you have calmed yourself, my child. As for the gorgon head, this House needs steady-tempered vigilance, not unthinking devotion. Despite repeated feedback, she refused to approach any aspect of her duties with restraint."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, you're saying you fired Dusa for ''working too hard''? Did you give her any warning?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"She did not understand how to work properly. Despite all that she did, she ultimately was a burden to this House. There was no warning necessary on my part."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Please give her another chance, Nyx. She can learn, she just needs to know what she did wrong. She gave this work everything. She just pushed too hard. Shouldn't something like that be forgivable?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"...It seems you have more patience than I, child. And, I did not realize you cared. But do not ask again for me to rescind my decision. Are we understood?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Dusa 05

|"You really asked Dusa to come back. Thank you, Nyx! I'm very grateful. And Megaera. Probably everybody here! I'm sure she won't let you down."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I know you care for her, child. And I admit I retain several concerns. Not only about the appropriateness of her conduct, but of her reckless inexperience. I do, however, see the possibility that she can work through these issues. Perhaps with your support."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Dusa Relationship 01
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"At first, I was deeply concerned that you were spending so much time with Dusa, child. It seemed unbecoming for the both of you, and threatened to disrupt our custodian's routine. Except... it pleases me to say that, in this case, I was mistaken about you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you for saying so, Nyx. Though, you mean you were mistaken about me, or about Dusa?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I was mistaken about both of you. That you would influence her in a harmful way, yet here, in point of fact, she has performed her duties with increasing skill. That she would fail to perform her role, or to learn well from her mistakes. Please do continue to look out for her."

|"Wait, you mean the Fates? And Stygius? I'm honored that they would have taken any notice of me. What is it that they want for me to know?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"They wish for me to impart to you these words, so that your blade, in turn, may hear them uttered from your lips: ''I see your kingly pardon from a prison of stone. ''Repeat them, and remember."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''I see your kingly pardon from a prison of stone''... this must be for one of the weapon's hidden forms. Please tell your daughters I am very grateful, Nyx."
|-

|"I shall, child. Although, I'm certain they already know. Though, whether they are aiding you or this is simply what must come to pass, I cannot say."
|-

|-

|"Nyx, the words you told me... when I spoke them to Stygius, the blade revealed to me the form of a great leader among men, taking counsel with his loyal retinue about a circular table. But if his reign is inevitable, why would the Fates need me?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"That I cannot say, child. It is peculiar having daughters who know every outcome that shall come to pass. It puts a strain on our relationship, and... I have learned never to ask they tell me more than they are willing to impart."

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I sensed this outcome, and it pleases me. Though, you never would have simply discovered such a thing. They each are unique artifacts that must be given willingly if they are to retain their shape, and power."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have to say, and I do mean this as a compliment: It's hard for me to imagine Night Incarnate herself fashioning these little keepsakes to be given between friends."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Do not mistake them for their unassuming look. Within them is the strength of an unbreaking bond between two souls conjoined."
|-
! colspan="2" |Nyx About Legendary 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, did you really give Dusa quite possibly the sole surviving epsilon edition Chthonic Companion in the entire Underworld? She's very grateful for it, so much so that she entrusted Fidi to my care. They grow in power that way, right?"
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"The severed gorgon head is not without redeeming attributes, my child. Though, I expected this companion would soon find its way to you, the way the two of you have grown attached. Thus, in one action, both of you have found encouragement."

|-

|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"By the way, I meant to tell you, child. The Ambrosia that you gave me? Rather than hold onto it indefinitely, I decided recently to sample it. Your father's claims about its flavor are quite false. I have never tasted anything like it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So glad you liked it, Nyx! And, good timing, too, because... I have for you another bottle, here. They say each one is different in its own respect! And besides, the pleasures of Olympus should be shared. Please, take it, won't you?"

|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx, along with giving you this bottle of Ambrosia here, there's something I have meant to say to you. The Three Fates have been very kind to me. Because, in denying me my birthmother... they gave me you. Without your steady presence here, I... can't imagine what it would be like."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"''Oh''. Then, the Three Fates are whimsical, indeed. When you were born, and I was filled with fear for what it meant for you to be alive, to be responsible for you... I must admit I did not guess that, one evening, you would provide for me both such a gift, and such a sentiment."

|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"What's this, it's kind of hard to read the hand-writing, it says, no way... ''To Hypnos, my biggest fan. Stay vigilant. Asterius. ''There's... even a little picture of a bull. You... I... wow... ''wow''!"

|-

|"Ah, neat! ''Huh'', thanks!! It's not so bad that you keep coming back like this, is it? At least for me it isn't!"

|"I have a secret, Hypnos. I've died on purpose every single time, just to see you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Gift 07
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hypnos, wanted to say you have really helped the thought of my coming back here time after time, painful death by death, not be inherently abhorrent. Your greetings really help! So I wanted you to have this."
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"But, but, but, wait, this, it's ''Ambrosia''! You are not supposed to have this here! We could both get in a lot of trouble, and I mean a ''lot'', if they catch us in the middle of this totally forbidden exchange!"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"One more forbidden exchange, Hypnos. Sometimes when I'm out there and about to die, I catch myself thinking... well, at least Hypnos will share one of his deep insights about why it is I utterly failed. So here! For all your generous advice."
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Aww, I... feel like I am going to cry, I mean, all my advice is free! You really didn't have to do this. But I sure am glad you did! Even if it is highly illegal! I... I... I...!"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Turns out there's quite a lot of dead to fight down in the Underworld. Though I probably got farther than I would have, thanks to you."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Always happy to oblige. Especially when it causes me to risk my station. To risk everything I've worked for."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Home First Meeting Alt
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What are you doing back here, Zagreus? I risked everything by helping you out there. So that was all for nothing, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Far from it, Than. I got where I needed to go, and if not for your help, maybe I wouldn't have. As for why I'm back... as Father would say, I have some business to attend to, here."

|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Be on your way, Zagreus. I have an audience with Lord Hades in a moment. An inquiry into my recent absences."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What are you worried about, Than? You've never given him a reason not to trust you."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Recently, I'm not so sure. Whatever you're doing, it had better be worth it."
|-

|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I still cannot entirely believe you really think there's any way you're getting out of here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why? You've been out. It's thanks to you the mortals end up down here maybe half the time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"That's different, that's my job. I can't stay there, and frankly I can barely stand it. Do you have any idea how bright it gets, up there?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No. But I look forward to finding out for myself."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"''Tsch'', well. We'll see what the Fates have to say about that. Maybe the shade of Daedalus can make you some protective eyewear or something."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Home Run Progress 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, the world outside... didn't you say that it would make you sick, being out there for very long at all? I understand now what you meant by that. Beautiful place and all, but... it's good to be back."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"See what I mean, now, Zag? Nice place to visit on occasion, sure. But I definitely wouldn't want to live there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Backstory 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I met her, you know. Persephone, I mean. You look more like your father, but... you have her eyes. One of them, anyway."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You never spoke of her to me. You must have known... you kept the truth from me, the same as Nyx?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It's not like that. I didn't know any more than you. Besides, Lord Hades ordered all of us to never speak of her again. I thought it just a bad relationship. I didn't realize she left her son."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Something tells me Father wouldn't let her take me even if she wanted."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Maybe so. But even still, she did abandon you. Your family's here, if you ask me. But I can understand that... you need answers."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Than. Come join me in the lounge for old time's sake. The coast is clear. The work can wait."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You're really asking me to join you for a drink...? I mean... you know what, sure. The work can wait."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...I somehow knew, you know. I always knew you weren't going to stay. You were... so restless here. You just needed a reason to leave! And I hoped you wouldn't find one this quickly. ''Eugh''. What am I saying? You have no idea."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, I know exactly what you're saying, Than. I'm sorry that I'm putting you through all of this, it's just... it's something that I have to do. But, I'm glad we know the truth about me, now. Maybe we can move on from there."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"''Tsk''... I've always lacked your optimism, Zag. Anyway... the work has waited long enough, I need to get back to it. Thanks for the drink."

|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Death 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, I've meant to ask... is it really the case that many mortals have a crippling fear of death?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It is, I'm quite feared, up there. Most of them cannot distinguish between me, and, say, Lord Ares, or your father, even. We fill them with despair. No helping it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why not? I mean, isn't it kind of a big problem that they have such negative associations, here? Can't we... I don't know, do something to educate them all?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"We've all the time to educate them, here. Their ignorance of death is solved almost as soon as they experience their first. Though I suppose they might be better off knowing before the fact."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Death 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than? I had another question about death. So... why is it mortals grieve so much about the thing, I mean... it definitely hurts there for a little while, but... it's not that bad."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"They see it as their one and only chance. Imagine if, after you perished, that was it. Back to the infinite Chaos. Everything about you. Returned to how it was before you were even there."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But that's absurd. One life? Though... ''eugh''. That's horrible, even to think about."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I know, right? Some of them know that isn't how it is, and try to tell their kind about what it is we do here, but... it's slow going, getting the information out. Either way! I get to be the bearer of good news."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Death 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Than? Something's been troubling me still, with what you said, about how mortals look at death. If most of them believe their life is all they have... how do they live? I mean, I can't even imagine what that's like. I'd be a lot more careful, at the very least!"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"They live with all their hearts, or at least try. I think there's something to it, truthfully. Though, some of them, they fall apart. They get here without me. On their own, gripped with despair. If only they knew what your father always says about all this."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you mean that '''there is no escape'''? From what? The mortals are up there, not here. Not while they're technically alive in their sense, anyway."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I mean, you can't escape your problems, Zagreus. You can run from your family, but you can't run from everything. You have no choice but to confront it, and work through it, sooner or later, one way or another. You, and all of us."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...I'm starting to notice that, yes. Though, to a mortal who has yet to die... don't they think of death as some sort of release? You come to end their misery, something like that?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I can release them from their decaying bodies. Sometimes, the Fates demand I bring them in sooner. That's about as much as I can do. Some of them get it early on, how to live. It's quite impressive, really, that they learn so quick."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Shifting 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, just how far are you able to shift, anyway, Than? I never could go more than a blade's length in front of me, while you're out there skipping across the entire world probably."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Most of it, yes. Don't beat yourself up, though, Zagreus. It's a practiced skill but I've apparently been able to do it since birth. Mother Nyx says I was a real handful."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Balcony 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, what is it you're always staring at out there, anyway, Than? I don't see anything."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"The River Styx is right in front of you, and you don't see anything, Zag? I can watch it endlessly. Studying the competition, you might say. Most mortals expect to get here by river, with Charon. Not with me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So you're locked in ruthless battle with a river, searching it for any signs of weakness, that sort of thing? That sounds stressful."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I find it rather soothing as a matter of fact. A break from having to deal constantly with mortal souls. Speaking of which... I have to pick somebody up right now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nemesis Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, my blade, the one I'm borrowing from Father anyway, it... revealed to me an older aspect of itself, of Nemesis. Nyx never mentions her. Have you two ever met?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"In case you haven't noticed, most of us who sprang from Nyx, we're not exactly close. Nemesis is fully occupied meting out justice on the surface. Our paths are not designed to cross. And based on everything I know, that's fine with me."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Eris Aspect 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"How's that Rail of Adamant been working out for you lately? Always figured the direct approach was more your style. Though, I happened to have a look at your permanent record lately, and turns out you're doing a lot of work with that thing."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why, Thanatos, you're learning to pry in others' business! The Rail's been working out just fine, thanks. Though, now that you mention it, how well do you know Eris, one of Nyx's daughters, right? Seems she wielded the Rail before me."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"The mortals call her Strife. She and her children... it's thanks partly to their dedicated efforts I'm so busy all the time. Though, it is best we didn't speak of her, I think."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Surface 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, I ought have asked by now, but... what's it like? Up there I mean, outside. You never talk about it, I... almost forget that's where you go, for work."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What can I say? It's... different. I never stay up there for very long, don't think I could, starts making me feel ill. Too many sensations all at once. And when the chariot of Helios is in the sky, it gets so bright that I can barely see."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That sounds awful. If it's that bad, why would all the Olympians chat it up so much?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"There's no accounting for their taste, I guess. But, I'm discounting certain aspects that are not so bad. You know what? I'll not spoil the surprise. I have a feeling you're going to see for yourself soon enough."
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What's going on with Charon, by the way, if you can tell me, Than? He's... never been particularly talkative, but he really seems to know the inner workings of this place."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I correspond with Charon all the time, but even I don't know the full extent of his responsibilities. He's an independent contractor of sorts, been here forever. Your father gives him plenty of space to work."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He must be compensated pretty well for having done this for so long. Tending the influx of new souls and all of that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I doubt he's in it for the compensation, Zagreus. There is no Underworld without Charon. I think he knows that, and your father knows it, too."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon 02 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, were you ever close with Charon, Than? Seems like no matter how much I try, I can't quite get through to him."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Wouldn't be surprised if you were closer to him than I am. Not all of Nyx's sons and daughters keep in steady touch. Though at least we're not always at each others' throats, like the other side of your family."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, you're not going to believe this, but... Charon's been helping me. All on his own, apparently! I was so sure that Nyx or someone put him up to it. That Skelly character I mentioned, Charon hired him!"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What are you talking about, Zagreus? Just because Charon's selling you things doesn't mean he's helping you. Wait, are you sure?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sure! His helper, Skelly, he's a lot more talkative, and finally let on. Although, he couldn't tell me how come Charon did a thing like this, I mean... we weren't ever close..."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"''Hmm''. All I can think of is... Charon's very dedicated to this House. Like some of us. Maybe he thought... he could help settle things, between you and your father. One way or another."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon Fight 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Than, now hypothetically, if I were to have vanquished Charon in single combat after having, I don't know, say, helped myself to one of his wares at no charge, how long would you say he'd hold it over me?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Everything is an exchange with Charon, Zag. If there was something you refused to pay for, then I'm going to assume that's why you're back here, now. The debt is paid in obols, or in blood. Or their closest counterparts, I guess."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Skelly 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, level with me on this. You didn't happen to hire a shifty character called Skelly to assist me here and there, did you?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Who, what? No. Why would you even ask?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Persephone 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Do you remember anything else about my mother, Than? Just, anything. You weren't close, I guess?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"We weren't. She kept to herself as I recall, and I would do the same. Unlike my present company, I do not ask too many questions. It was quite clear to me she wasn't from this place."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Father isn't from this place, either. How was she any different?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Sometimes I have to be reminded that Lord Hades wasn't born here, like the rest of us. But Persephone, she... she had a radiance about her, I suppose. Reminded me of the outside, but... I don't mean that in a negative respect."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Sisyphus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, you don't hold a grudge against old Sisyphus, do you? He seems rather apprehensive about you. I understand you met not on the best of terms."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He is a brazen one, I have to give him that. I hadn't realized that you were close. Despite some questionable choices on your part, I don't think you're the poorest judge of character, and so... maybe I have him wrong."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I only have a faint impression of the man he used to be, although it seems he's changed a lot, since then. Thank you for understanding, anyway."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I heard you stayed the knave-king's sentence. I should be angry with you. Sisyphus must be the only mortal ''ever ''to have humiliated me. But Mother Nyx, she... must have backed you, didn't she..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"We did what needed to be done. As much as Father likes making examples out of wretched shades, an eternal sentence felt a little excessive in this case. Besides... Sisyphus isn't leaving, anyway. Seems to have found his niche."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Oh? Well, he's an odd one through and through, I guess. As long as I don't have to deal with him again."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Achilles 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You and Achilles ever get to talk much, Than?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I have my orders, he has his. What do you think? Even back when he was still alive, there was no real chance I was going to be the one to take him here, given his line of work."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Because he was a warrior. When mortals die a violent death, they're no longer your case, are they?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"No. I tend to those in less of a hurry to come here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Your trainer's been absent from his post, more so than usual. You voided his pact with Lord Hades, didn't you? I don't know how you did it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know he's more than my trainer, Than. As for how I did it, turns out being the first and only son of Hades has its privileges. Now Achilles gets to be with someone he loves. Who loves him back."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Love is common among mortals. Is theirs really so special as to be worth the trouble? Not just on your part, but theirs?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Megaera 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You've seen a lot of Megaera lately, haven't you, Zag?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's not like that, Than. She's there to slow me down. Get in my way."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"If you insist. Although I think it's much more complicated than you say."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah... her sisters are back. They're... hard to deal with. I don't think Meg is on good terms with either one."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"That's not what I meant. But fine, you've told me all I need to know, for now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Megaera 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You and Meg go back a long way, don't you? I forget sometimes you two are pretty close."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Our responsibilities must have us cross paths often, yes. But I didn't really get to know her until after the whole humiliating affair with Sisyphus."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, right. He got stuck in Tartarus after that, under Meg's personal supervision. So you bonded over your shared disdain for Sisyphus?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"We each had to blow off some steam, yes. That was some of the hardest I ever worked, back then, and her, too, I think. When you go through something like that with someone, it brings you closer, I suppose."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, there's something that I meant to tell you. Ask you, rather. You're close with Megaera, so, what I mean is... you know about ''us'', right?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Yes, of course. Why do you ask?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, it's just... I figured since you deal with mortals all the time, I know that some of them, they choose a single suitor. It's a valid custom, if it's yours...!"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"The mortals have their customs, yes, indeed. Quite a variety, in point of fact. However, none as yet have stuck with me, I think. So don't concern yourself with things like that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're saying you're not angry with me? Or Meg, for that matter?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Not any more than usual. Tell her that I said hello when next you meet."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Being Close With Dusa 01

|"Than, you don't take issue with me being close with Dusa, do you? She brings such warmth to this place... I really appreciate having her here."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You don't need to ask me such things, Zagreus. They're your feelings."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Ares 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, what's your relationship with Ares on Olympus? I know he deals in death himself, but... his approach seems rather different from your own."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I do not care for his approach at all. But he has been professionally courteous with me. More than I can say for most of your Olympian relatives, I suppose."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You mean the rest of the Olympians don't treat you well?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Discounting Hermes, I should say, the rest of them have nothing much to do with me at all. I can imagine why, I know it's complicated with your father here. But as for Ares... I think he's all right."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Ares 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than? I thought you ought to know that Ares, he... I think he's taken quite an interest in Nyx. Keeps asking me to talk to her on his behalf."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Finally. It's about time Olympus took notice of Mother and all her accomplishments."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Finally? You don't think Ares has untoward intentions or anything like that?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He'd be a hollow fool if he did. Why do you think they fear us on Olympus, Zagreus? Because of Hypnos? I don't think Mother Nyx requires your concern. Though, by all means, talk to her about it, if you like."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Chaos 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Mother Nyx told me you restored the Eldest Sigil, Zagreus. I couldn't believe that was your doing. What you did... it meant a lot to her."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It was my pleasure. Say, did Nyx ever let on to you of her relationship with Chaos, at any point?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"No, not everyone is quite as sharing as you are, Zag. Nor as inclined to pry. But still... in this case, sounds like it worked out. So, thank you. If she hasn't said as much."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I can tell when Mother Nyx is upset, Zagreus. And I know better than to ask her, so I'm going to ask you. What happened?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Probably because Nyx took issue with me chatting with Dusa from time to time. Is that really so unbecoming of me? Not even Father seems to care."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Well, Mother cares! And I, for one, know better than to question it. None of us would be here were it not for her. If she has a request for you, you honor it."

|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sorry I raised my voice with you last time, Than. I know Nyx puts so much into this place, and has nurtured so many of us here."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It's not me you should be apologizing to, Zag. Although, with Mother Nyx, sometimes it's best to leave her be. As for Dusa... I didn't mean to suggest you should abandon your friend."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx let her go, Than. Dusa, I mean, she's gone. What do I do?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"If I were you, I would start getting over it as soon as possible. But, I don't see you doing that. Just remember... maybe this isn't about you. Dusa's job may have been far too much for her. Mother Nyx is strict, but she is fair."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Then she should give Dusa another chance. Has Meg heard? She'll be furious."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Megaera will be no such thing. Some of us don't default to questioning every decision from our superiors."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 04
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I saw that Dusa's back. You must have worked your ways on Mother Nyx. Don't know how you do it. Can't remember the last time I saw her budge on anything."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx genuinely cares about this House and all of us. She had to come around on something like this. Dusa's one of the hardest workers here. Even if she has room to improve."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Incessant hard work can lead to trouble, Zagreus. I think maybe that's why Mother was concerned. We all know how your father can get. She doesn't need someone like Dusa taking after him."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Hypnos 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, you know, Hypnos, he adores you. Besides just driving you to madness, now and then."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I'm rather used to the relationship, thanks, Zagreus. Seems like you got to know him pretty well."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, dying repeatedly can end up bringing people closer, I suppose."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I don't know what's worse, dying repeatedly or Hypnos. Although, I guess I'm grateful for your patience with him, Zag."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Hypnos 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Got to tell you something, Than. You can be pretty mean to Hypnos! And that's coming from someone who's mean to Hypnos a lot. Believe me, I completely understand, but... still."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He's utterly incompetent, Zag. He wouldn't even be here if Mother Nyx wasn't trying to whip him into some sort of shape."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah, but... pretty much none of this would be here, were it not for Nyx, right? Anyway my point is not that you should go easy on him, but... there must be some way not to get as frustrated. You'll both be better off."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I know, it's just...! You're right. I catch myself feeling particularly horrid after talking to him. He can be very frustrating, and self-absorbed... though, I know he means well. Probably."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Hypnos 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I can hardly believe it. Hypnos finally came out on top, huh? Even Father seemed pleased with him. That's more than I get."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I can hardly believe it either, Zagreus. But then again, he's one of Mother Nyx's offspring, so we shouldn't be so surprised. Though, I have to thank you for talking to me about him a while back..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, that? I noticed you two getting along better recently. So what's your secret?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He loves lists. Doesn't do well with subtlety, so much, but spell things out for him, and he will get right on it. Long as he's awake, at least. He's still working on that part."

|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I saw you voided the old pact between Orpheus and your father. So now he gets to see his wife from time to time?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He does, and I did, Than. I think we can stand to see a little less of him if it means he can be happier for the remainder of eternity."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You really need to learn to stop meddling in others' affairs. Did either of them even ask your help? I can't imagine Orpheus did, and I'm guessing his wife's feelings were complicated, too, from what I know of the circumstances of their final meeting."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What? Orpheus is my mate, Than. And I came to know his muse, Eurydice, as well. They still had feelings for each other, but with no way to communicate."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"So you decided to step in. ''Tsch''. I think my instincts on the subject are just not the same as yours. I know your intentions were in the right place, but... you know what, forget it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Quest Log 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I saw the Fated List of Minor Prophecies was requisitioned through the House Contractor, Zagreus. Didn't take you for an agent of the Fates."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Turns out I'm full of surprises, Thanatos. Though, the Three Fates are your sisters, aren't they? Surprised you didn't requisition the List yourself."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Guess it just wasn't meant to be. Though, I don't know them at all. Keep only to themselves, somewhere. Sometimes I wonder whether everything really is preordained, or whether they're making all this up as they go."
|-

|"You took Lord Hades down... you really did. I've never seen him quite like this before. I could scarce believe it when he came up through the Pool of Styx, himself..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Seemed only fair in the grand scheme of things. He slew his own parents at some point, right? I think the Fates enjoy this sort of thing."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Come on, Zag, take some credit where it's due. Though... you'll forgive me if I keep my distance for a little while, as I think you have some issues to resolve. You watch yourself."
|-

|-
|'''Thanatos'''

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I am. I figured it's the only way I could continue interrupting you while you try to do your job. You work too hard, Than, live a little, right?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"''Heh''. Well then, I'll see what I can do about that. You'll have to show me what you mean by '''live a little''', though."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Persephone Meeting 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Have to tell you something, Than. My birthmother... she didn't abandon me. Or at least... she didn't think she did."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"She didn't ''think ''she did? What are you talking about, Zag? She left when you were born. Was never seen or spoken of again, until all this with you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, it turns out... she never knew I was alive, at all. Complications when I was born. She had been struggling already here, and it was all too much, I guess. By the time Nyx brought me back... my mother was long gone."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"''What''? But, Mother Nyx, and your father, they... could have sent for her, let her know... they must have known where she went!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx knew. But, Father must have convinced her that my mother... that it would be for the best if she never found out. About me. So she could live in peace. Away from all of this. And away from Olympus."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"That's... a lot to take in."
|-

|"...Answer me something, Zagreus. What am I to you, exactly, as of late? Because, sometimes, with you, I..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sometimes at a loss myself, Thanatos. Though one thing I know is it's always really good running into you out there, it's... well, exciting. Sparring with you and all that! And then, I know it means that I might get to see you here."
|-

|"Well, here I am. But you didn't answer my question. Though, you know something? Forget I asked. I've got to go."
|-

|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You know I don't have time to list all your infuriating habits, Zagreus. Though... if any of them were outside my usual tolerance threshold, I promise to let you know, all right?"
|-

|"So then, we're good. Because I think we're good, but I just wanted to make sure."
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Relationship 03
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...It just struck me how much you've changed, Zag. I still remember when you kept trying to singe Cerberus' tail with your feet. Haven't seen you do that in a while."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, I definitely learned my lesson there. But, thanks, I guess. You've opened up a lot, yourself, by the way. Talking to you lately, it's a world apart from the first time. You looked like you were going to slice my head off."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It sure must have taken a lot of courage for you to come right up and tell me you thought I looked better before I cut my hair. I still ask myself how come I didn't keep ignoring you after that. Or slice your head off."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, the option is always available, I guess. Hey, you ever think of growing it out again?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"No. It kept getting in my way. Sliced it right off and never looked back. So... plenty of personal growth all around, then?"
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you for asking, Than. I don't know how much more I can say right now, given everything. I'm still figuring it out myself. I'm thankful you've been there to help me get to see her from time to time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Well, if there's something more that I can do to support you in this, let me know, all right? Sounds like you're making progress, at least."
|-

|"So, between us... all your attempting to break out of here, over and over... you're now authorized to keep that up? Exposing weaknesses in Underworld security, huh."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Something like that. I guess I've gotten pretty decent about escaping from a place that's known for being inescapable. Lets me keep in touch with the other side of the family. Work with you from time to time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I have to say I never thought I'd hear you talking about looking forward to working, Zag. You feeling all right? Spending too much time on the surface, maybe?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh I'm feeling fine. I never thought I was much good at anything, but... if my fated purpose is to be a master of frustrating Father's efforts to make everything strictly perfect, I think I'm OK with that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Well, then, I'll be looking forward to working with you in a more official capacity. Even if we're still supposed to keep it all under wraps, for sake of appearances. See you out there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Post Ending 02
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Have to tell you, Zag. It's different, with your mother around here. Don't mean to be so obvious, but... it's something about your father, I suppose."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think they have a lot of work ahead of them. As long as they're trying... he's trying... I think I'm good with that, for now. Though, I am glad she's here."

|"It has. The last time, what was it you said? That there must be some resolution to the ''matter'', as you called it, with my son? Well it is settled, now. Isn't it, boy?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I mean, you're still trying just as hard as ever to prevent me from escaping past the threshold of your realm, so, I don't know if I'd exactly call the matter ''settled''. But... it does feel different, now."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"And so you see... I would continue in our mutual good graces, if you please. This House can only function if the upper management is in accord. What do you say?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I say, you honor me, my lord. I appreciate you telling me, yourself. And I concur that, for the good of all the Underworld, it is imperative that each of us continue to perform at our full strength."
|-

|"Then, as you were. Dismissed."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It isn't much, Than, but I got you something."

|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 02
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What, really...? Come on, what is this, Zagreus. You think handing this to me makes up for everything you've put us through?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's just something I found out there that I thought you might like, Than. Don't think anything of it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 03
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Why bother with such empty gestures, Zag. You've said you're getting out of here; best focus on that and leave me be."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's not an empty gesture, Than. Besides, if I wasn't trying to stay focused, I'd be drinking it myself."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 04
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You shouldn't be doing this, Zag. You picked sides, and things are not the same. A momentary stab at thoughtfulness can't fix something like that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"We've been through a lot, Than, and I think we'll be going through a lot more yet. Consider it a token of our kinship."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 04 B
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Don't know what you're expecting, giving this to me. If there's a catch here, I don't want to know."

|"We've been through a lot, Than, and I think we'll be going through a lot more yet. Consider it a token of our kinship."
|-

|"What is it with the generosity lately...? Look I'll just stash this with the rest if you really don't have a better thing to do with it than dump it off on me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, that's an idea. One of these days or nights, we'll have enough of this stuff to throw a feast to make all of Olympus jealous."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 06
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You can't be serious. You're serious...? ''Eh'', you know what, fine. I'll take this and we'll go about our business. Though I don't see why you bother."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why I bother? Why, how else can I show you how I feel except by handing you these bottles from time to time?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 07 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Than. For all the times you've bailed me out, and just, all the times you've been around for me... I thought I'd get you this. The real thing."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Ambrosia...! Zagreus, where did you even... don't you think this is a bit excessive?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You say that like it's a bad thing. Little bit of excess from time to time never hurt anyone I'm sure."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"''Oh'', you would be surprised. Though if you're going to embarrass me, you know what, I am going to reciprocate. ''Behold''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 08
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"For you, Thanatos. The Olympians might be accustomed to this stuff but I think we should have our share of it down here. At least you should."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You know... the Olympians do have good taste in certain things. The last bottle you gave me... it was... better than expected. Though, I almost decided not to try it at all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But try it you did! And now, you'll get to try this one for comparison's sake. Each one's supposed to be different you know."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Different, huh. Well, then, I guess I'll have to see what you mean by that. Thank you, Zag. You didn't have to do this."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 09
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I hope you're ready for some more of the real thing, there, Than, because I got you some, and I won't be taking '''Tsch, what is this, Zag' ''for an answer."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Ugh, what is this? Come on, already, Zagreus, are you just messing with me, now? How did you even manage to get more of this, much less decide to hand it off to me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"In order: no, I'm not; by ransacking my father's realm repeatedly; and it's because I like you, Thanatos. In case you still have some misgivings about that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You ''like ''me, Zagreus...? I never thought, I... don't know why that sounds so strange, coming from you. Given everything that's happened as of late."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah. Look, if you don't feel the same way about me at this point, I would rather know. Cease all these coy gift exchanges, and all that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I never said anything like that! You know what, there's... a bunch of mortals I have to go fetch. Good-bye."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 10
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, I wanted to apologize for the last time I approached you with a bottle of the real thing, and give the whole exchange another shot. Would that be all right?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"''Hmph''! You're asking my consent to give me yet another lavish gift? Sure! Permission granted. Though, what makes you think that your approach this time is going to be any more successful than the last?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know that it will. I never really know exactly where I stand with you. But I know how I feel. And I'd rather be up front with you, even if it means risking our relationship, such as it is."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Our relationship? It wasn't long ago you were prepared to throw it all away while making for the surface, if you don't recall. But now you're saying that you care for me, and... what, exactly, Zagreus?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes, that's what I'm saying, Than. I should not have left the way I did, without letting you know. But when you found me, I... think that's when... that's when I knew. Or started to realize, you know?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I... yes. I know, I think, because... when I heard you took off, the anger that I felt, it was... it wasn't something I expected. So... ''ungh''. What do we do now?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Maybe we ought to take our time? Unlike the real thing there, that's a commodity we have in good supply. Just know that, if you feel the way I do... you know where to find me. And if not... I'm grateful, anyway."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...I see. Well, then. The best that I can say for now is that... I'm grateful, too, for this. Take care of yourself, Zag."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 07
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I have to hand it to you, Zag, you're really putting in the work to get me to forgive you after all you've done. I'm honestly surprised."

|"I left when it was necessary, Than. I thought of you and hoped you'd understand. I have to do this."

|"...Than. Home is never going to be the same for me. There's no use trying to pretend. I have to go."

|"That's fair as an assessment, I would say. But then again, it's never been an easy time for me. I know I have to do my job. But I don't have to keep on helping you, like this."

|-

|"I'm sorry, Dusa, I... put a lot on you, and... maybe I shouldn't have, since I'm the Prince and everything, as you point out, and... sometimes, I forget myself. I'd never pressure you, it's just... I thought you had these feelings for me, too."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, ''hahaha'', look, there's nothing to apologize for, not at all. In fact... all this is a relief. I've learned a lot from you, too, and I cherish our friendship for what it is. Do you... do you think that we could still be friends? Or, is it better that you didn't see me anymore...?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Don't say ''that''! Though, I was going to ask you the same thing. I'd really like it if you'd be my friend! Though, my career comes first, so... I don't want you doing any special favors, promise me? I need to see how far I can get on my own."

|-

|"Oh, you got to try it, after all? What did you think, all it's cracked up to be?"
|-

|-

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, Prince, Zagreus, don't worry about that! Even I didn't know what I was going through. When I first started working here, I was just ''so ''impressed with you, I mean... you were the only one who would stand up to your father! I thought about you all the time!"

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, you can ask me anything! But, ''um'', somebody else romantically, not really, no? It's not really my thing? It doesn't mean I don't have feelings for you, though! You know that, right? I wouldn't drop what I'm doing and throw myself at danger for just anyone, you know!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I definitely know. There's seven kinds of love, or so, isn't that right? It isn't something that's taught extensively down here, though, so... there's still a lot for me to learn, I guess."
|-

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"No, ''um'', not exactly, Prince! It's what it sounds like, ''hrrrsssss''!! Just, scary hissing, really, takes some practice not to sound like that with a forked tongue! I really wanted to fit in. Hey, how about you? Always wondered how come you have a surface accent. Weren't you born here?"

|"Hey, ''no, no no'', it's not like that, it's just... a feeling that I've had from glimpses of the interactions that I've seen between you two. I haven't always got along with Nyx, but I know she cares deeply about this House and everyone in it. Including you."

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Ah'', Prince, no, it isn't you, it's definitely me! There's all these things she said I need to work on, calmness, not making so many lists, putting things into perspective, not working myself too hard, not taking blame for things that aren't my fault...!"
|-

Suddenly, I had all this time to myself, and... what I realized was, I was... so, so tired. I think I really needed the break."
|-

|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I love this work too much to get burned out, Prince. But that's me. I know there's more to being alive or being dead than just your work, but... my work happens to be important to me. And besides... if I don't push myself from time to time, how can I ever know my limits, right?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But if you go too far beyond your limits, things can get bad. Believe me. I mean, you almost lost the job you care so much about."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It should be more than sometimes that you feel that way, as far as I'm concerned. I just... I've never met anybody like you before. My father always told me not to smile quite as much, but... you're like me."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"What, because I smile, ''haha''? Smiling's just a little something that I like to do to deal with the day! Though, oh, ''that's ''what you meant, I... oh, I see. I, look, this is kind of a lot, I, I had better go...! I'll cherish the Ambrosia, though, OK?!"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, look, if I listened to everything I was told, my life would be a lot different and a lot worse off, I think! So... who cares what anybody says? I enjoy your company."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"And I enjoy yours, too! Wasn't long ago that I was just a lonely gorgon head, all by myself in the big Underworld, looking for steady work. And then, I heard about the opening here, in your father's House? Well I got it! It seemed too good to be real. And then, there was you..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I remember when we first met. You were carrying three bowls for Cerberus and bumped right into me. It all went flying, but you cleaned up half of it before it hit the ground. Then flew away before I got your name. I thought I'd never see you again."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I was ''so ''embarrassed! Worse... I thought I was done for, here. But, I got another chance! That was your doing, wasn't it? You've been looking out for me, all this time! That's so sweet of you, I... I don't know how to thank you, I... I, I better put this Ambrosia away, for safe keeping, OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Dusa Gift 10
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Dusa, I was thinking that this batch of Ambrosia ought to hold the lounge over for quite a while! Keep things livelier for everyone. And, please take a bottle for yourself, won't you? As a token of my affection."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Oh''! Y-you said your ''affection'', huh, I... wow! I... really like you, also, Zagreus. I liked you from the start! You were so different from your father, and Miss Nyx, I could just tell, but... wait, what am I saying, I am such a dummy! You're just being friendly with me, right...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I would be more than that, if it pleased you. You're very wonderful, and... you light up this House. But I would never risk our friendship, so, if this is where we draw the boundary, please, just let me know."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"''Um''... wait, wait. Wait, wait. Did you just say I'm... ''wonderful''?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I did, indeed. And I am glad to get it off my chest, if you must know! Though... what about you? How do you feel?"
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"I, ''wow'', I, I never thought you'd... have those kinds of feelings, for somebody like me. It's really nice to hear! It makes me feel complete. But, ''um'', Zagreus, I don't know if I can be what you need, I mean? Wait. You weren't, you weren't just being nice to me for all this time, because...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''What''? No, no, Dusa, of course not, I... ''ungh'', why is it so damn difficult to share one's feelings with somebody else? I don't want to ruin what we have. If only you could see what's in my heart."
|-
|'''Dusa'''
|"Oh, ''hahaha'', I was just checking, don't feel bad, OK? You don't seem capable of hiding what's in your heart. And I mean that in the best possible way. I'm so happy, it's just... all this is a lot, and, I'm on duty right now, but... see you soon...?"

|"Oh, hello Zagreus. I was just wondering if you had ever heard of any other court musicians who had lost the will to sing? Your father's asked me to explain myself and honestly it has been rather difficult."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, you found her? What happened?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Well, this was back when I was still alive, you understand. Your father, why, he doesn't care for anyone to leave this realm, and, basically now I'm stuck here as well! Not seen her since, and, I'm not much for travel anymore."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's... I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for letting me know. I hope you get to see her again someday."

|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"''Oh'', that was kind of him, my friend! When I first ventured deep into this realm, whilst searching for the soul of my lost muse... after I failed utterly, it was Lord Hermes who whisked her away. It happened so fast. He did an ''excellent ''job!"

|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"''Oh'', why, I learned from many different sources, Zagreus. That is before all of my inspiration started coming from a single source. I credit my accomplishments to her, and to Apollo, and the gods. And to considerable time spent practicing!"

|"Our renowned court musician ought to have the finest means available, I think. I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus. Though, tell me something, how can it play your music when you're not even here?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Who can explain the secret art of Daedalus, my friend? Know only that, whenever it produces music for your listening enjoyment, that the sound you hear is coming from my soul!"

|'''Orpheus'''
|"So, I am quite confused, I must admit, my friend. The Queen Persephone, she is your mother, then? How is it that she came to reside, here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, ''erm''... it all started when my father saw her on Olympus, and... they fell madly in love. He swept her off her feet, and brought her here. The Olympians, they got pretty worried when they saw she was gone. But now it's OK! Everything's out in the open."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"But, surely the Queen's mother on Olympus, the great goddess Demeter... surely she would quite like it if she saw her daughter still, from time to time?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, that! Thing is, Mother ate some... pomegranate seeds when she was here. And we have rules about that stuff, you know! It means she cannot leave this place for very long at all. I'm sure Demeter will understand. And unfreeze everything when her daughter's around."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Ah, yes, pomegranate seeds, of course, of course! Though, there is one more subject I don't understand, which is... how ''you ''fit into all of this. Were you not trying to escape from here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Forget about me, Orpheus! This isn't about me, it's about Mother. What's important is she's here, where she belongs."
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Orpheus? I take it you know all about the time I burned my father's hands to a crisp the moment I was born? He grasped me by the feet, and they caught fire! And that's why he still wears those fancy rings: to cover up the hideous scar tissue."
|-

|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"But, Zagreus, that is a striking revelation, the connection you describe. I see it! I can see it now! To think the god of wine and you are intricately linked, it isn't obvious, is it?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, there's more to it! A bit grim, really, as I'm a little older than I look. You see, the Titans, they once tore me limb from limb, but then my heart was saved, and that's where Dionysus comes from! That is the connection between us, you understand me, mate?"
|-

|"Orpheus, sorry to interrupt, it's just... I couldn't help but notice that new ballad that you're playing, there."

|"Technically, one ought consider it a hymn, my friend! In honor of your numerous travails, prior to your current set of circumstances, which must pale in comparison to all the rigors you've endured to date!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', the thing is... none of the information in your hymn is accurate. It's nonsense. I was just kidding with you, mate! I tried to make that clear. You get so lively when I tell you my tall tales, you know? You're not angry with me, are you...?"

|"Say, Orpheus, Eurydice told me your songs, some of them came from her? She seems quite brilliant. You choose your muses well!"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I owe my everything to my Eurydice. She authored many of my songs, indeed; and she inspired many, many more. Whilst living, we collaborated frequently, you see."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But weren't you the famous one? I don't understand why she doesn't share your renown."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"It is but one of life's injustices, I fear. I always sang her praises every chance I had. And she asserted herself splendidly. Yet even still, our listeners believed our songs, they came from me... what else could I have done?"

|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Why, I don't know, my friend. Once people set their minds to certain things... it can be difficult to show them other possibilities exist. What's to be done?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know... tell them they're wrong? Politely, perhaps not? Or... tell them what's right. Get the word out about what's right? Can't we do that?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Get the word out...? But I am court musician of this House. My songs no longer reach too many ears. Although... I do suppose all of these shades about... they are my audience, as well. I shall make certain that they know whose songs I sing."

|"You sound despondent again, mate. You must wish you were there right now. I'm sorry you had to come all the way back."
|-

|"I never thought I'd see the Queen again. I still can't quite believe she's back... and staying? Is that really your doing?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's her doing, not mine. So you know her? Because... you could have told me. About her. Who she was to me."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Don't know her all that well. But I do know Nyx, and I've been bound to secrecy as part of my oath to this House. I flay oathbreakers and liars, Zagreus. Wouldn't do for me to be no better than them, now, would it?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, I suppose not. So what does this mean for Nyx, now that she's back? Or for you, for that matter?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"The Queen always gave Nyx her space. Your father, though... I don't know what it'll be like for him, if she decides to stick around this time."

|"So the Olympians are backing you officially now? Doing their part to help the family business, finally. Lord Hades probably never thought he'd see the day. Night? You know what I mean."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Seems only fair they should help in some capacity. They all work together on the surface, and, let's face it, they're responsible for a good number of shades pouring into this realm. Least they can do is help shore up the whole '''there is no escape' ''reputation we've got."
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Relationship 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Well, Zag? You like things nice and complicated, don't you. Apparently so do I."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"If you're asking if I have any regrets about what happened between us, the answer is no. Being with you... any complications there are worth it."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You don't need to tell me. Two rules, if you want to keep this up. First... we set the personal aside when we're out there. I better not hear a soul say I'm going soft on you. And second... keep up this slightly more mature thing you've had going for you recently."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wasn't planning on sliding back into the insensitive nonsense of youth, so I don't think the second thing will be a problem. But the first... can we really just keep killing each other out there like nothing happened?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Relationship 01 B
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"''Tsk''... Come off it, Zag. Are you really going to act all uncomfortable every time you see me now? More than usual I mean."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, it's just... I felt terrible, turning you away. It's just... I've been so confused lately, and... I trust you. You're someone I can talk to. I guess I'm... afraid to lose that."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Don't be an idiot, and you won't. We've been through a lot together. Grown, maybe. This particular relationship... it can't die so easily, I think."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Relationship 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I feel like everybody knows about us, Meg. Even Aphrodite, herself, seemed to know we were involved. It's not like I've been going around boasting. You wanted to keep things quiet, didn't you?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Zagreus. Are you happy with how things are between us now? Or do you have a problem with it?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, I could do without the kill-or-be-killed stuff if we're being honest, that part is still a little weird, but otherwise... yes, I mean... I'm happy. You're ''you''."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Then, that's enough. Let them say what they want. What does it matter? We're gods. The things they say about us... even other gods... you pay too much attention to it, it'll drive you out of your mind."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But... I know how important your career is to you. This won't create a problem?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"We've already crossed that bridge, I think. Stop worrying."
|-

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"...Shut up."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Zagreus Promotion 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Never in my wildest fantasies did I imagine you'd ever end up on the Featured Houseservant Board, Zagreus. I still can't entirely believe it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Whoa'', back up! Can you elaborate a bit about these wildest fantasies, Meg?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I'm serious. You should be proud. Not arrogantly proud to a fatal fault or anything, but a little bit is all right in a case like this."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Repeated Losses 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Got to tell you something, Zagreus. I'm not getting any more used to losing to you like this. I mean... you don't even stop to rub it in. You know how humiliating that is?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, you're saying you would feel ''less ''ashamed about the outcomes of our fights if I were to gloat ''more ''about beating you? How does that make any sense?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You know what doesn't make any sense? That you keep beating me. I must be getting sloppy if I'm that predictable... too bad none of the other wretches I have to deal with put up much of a fight."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Sisters 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You and your sisters really don't get along well, do you."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Alecto and Tisiphone and I each have a different outlook, I would say. We've learned mostly to stay out of one another's way."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That doesn't sound like a healthy basis for a relationship between siblings."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Are you lecturing me about healthy relationships with family, Zagreus? Your family, your father's family, is the most broken and corrupted in the history of the entire concept."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...Fair point. I... didn't mean to sound like I had any meaningful advice, there, Meg. We're stuck with our bloodlines and our relatives, aren't we."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Your family cut their Titan parents into pieces and then scattered them in Tartarus. Remember that when next you tell me about family."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Sisters 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, while it was brutal squaring off against the three of you, I have to say, Meg... I was happy you were with your sisters. Nothing like a common cause for bringing bitter rivals together, right?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You have your Pact of Punishment to thank for our reunion, there. We have to answer to its terms. But my sisters and I, we got on better than I had expected, I will give you that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So you've patched things up, then? Going to start spending more quality time together and all that?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"''Hm'', let's not get carried away. A work assignment forcing our cooperation is not exactly a big step in the quality of our relationship."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Alecto 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Alecto's really something else. She must have been a real handful, huh?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"My youngest sister takes a lot of pleasure from her work. I've learned something of that from her. But that's as far as we relate, I think."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She could learn a thing or two from you, I'm sure. About having a little common decency, perhaps."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"She won't be learning anything from me. The contempt you get from her is unconditional. I learned not to take it personally."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Tisiphone 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', so, about Tisiphone, is... ''uh''... everything all right with her? Talk of murder, all the time, and all."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Tisiphone is charged with punishing the worst that mortals have to offer. More than charged. Her work is everything to her."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No time for family or recreation, then, I take it? Pity what happens to those overly obsessed with work."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I get what you're insinuating, Zagreus. I'm nothing like her. Not even close. And don't you dare compare the two of us again."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Tisiphone 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"So you've been trying to give Tisiphone speech lessons between fights to the death. Are you bored, or just naive?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Come on, if her vocabulary consists of two different although admittedly almost identical words, there's got to be room for growth, there. Besides, I feel like... maybe she's lonely, or something. Has anyone ever tried to teach her anything?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Maybe, just maybe, you're projecting your own insecurities onto her a little bit? Tis can take care of herself. Always has. Talking's not her strong suit like it's yours. But if you, in all your wisdom, think you've got something to teach her, you go right ahead."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You've tried already, haven't you? She's pretty dead-set on the murder thing, then?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Thanatos 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You and Thanatos don't work together much anymore, do you, Meg?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"No. Though he still brings me my assignments every now and then."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oathbreakers, traitors, and the like? Sending them straight to Tartarus, huh. Must be quite an experience going from living and breathing, to... being dead, to being whisked off by Thanatos, straight to you and your whip."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"If that's not the experience mortals are looking for, they need only keep their oaths and not betray the ones they're closest to. It's not that hard."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Hypnos 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're not too broken up about how things ended between you and Hypnos, are you, Meg?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I'm still in a state of shock. I'll have to pick up the pieces somehow, and figure out how to get on with my existence."
|-

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You got that court musician to pipe up again. I know ''you ''can't shut up, but didn't know it was contagious."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, it was all Orpheus, not me. Can't sing like that without a lot of motivation, inner turmoil, who knows what else. Why, don't you like it? This lounge seems better with a little song."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"This lounge is fine. And the singing... not used to it yet."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Not seen the court musician sulking over there quite as much lately. Your doing, I hear?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You'll just have to sulk for the both of you, I guess, then, Meg. But if you must know, on my authority I have released Orpheus from the terms of his old, rather unfair agreement with Father, so he can see his wife at least from time to time."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"And Lord Hades is OK with you just picking out old binding contracts and nullifying them? You're exploiting your status."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm doing no such thing. Father wanted me involved in all this business with his pacts, and presiding over the dead, then fine. But I'll do it my way."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What do you think of all the lounge decor, there, Meg? Looking a little better these days, wouldn't you say?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You know, it isn't bad. Though I have heard the strangest thing, that you're responsible, for all of this? I couldn't understand why you would even bother, honestly."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, it's a popular locale for off-duty Underworld officers to take a load off between shifts, and so I figure... least I can do is pitch in and make the place a little better than I left it, right?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"How very selfless of you, Zagreus. Soon doubtless it'll be your portrait hanging on that wall back there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 02
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"The prism-sphere in the corner is maybe a little much. But the fireplace... the bat-cage... the aquarium... this lounge is practically comfortable. Lord Hades would strongly disapprove."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Good thing he never sets foot in here, then, huh? Wait, you don't miss when things were all sad and dreary in here, do you?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I'm still getting used to it. But, no."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Battie's doing great, Meg. Reminds me of you every time I think of her. Helps keep me company throughout my little jaunts outside. So you've a thing for bats, then?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"That's good. And yes, the bats around here, they and I have always shared an understanding, you could say. I usually care for the pups myself. But Battie? She seemed more your style."

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I can't imagine why. Nyx has her under strict orders, yet you keep on stopping by for your little chats. You think she doesn't notice?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What does she care? I talk to everybody around here at least a bit."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Who, you mean Dusa? Like I had anything to do with that. It's Nyx you should be cross with, not me!"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I don't think so. Nyx warned you. ''Ungh'', you know I can't go to her myself about this, so ''fix it''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You saw Dusa's back, right, Meg? She's getting another chance. Nyx reconsidered!"
|-
|'''Megaera'''

|-

|"You don't sound all that pleased..."
|-

|"I'm so proud of Dusa lately, Meg! Chief Custodian of the House, was it? That's quite an honor coming from Nyx."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I thought all the added responsibility would stress Dusa out worse than usual. But she's taking it in stride."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're always looking out for her. Thanks for that."
|-

|"Not doing it for you. Though... thanks for looking out for her, yourself."
|-

|-

|"I did not appreciate you sending Dusa after me out there, Zag. You leave her out of this! Though... it was good to see her out of this damned House for a change."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"See, I, too, thought she could use the fresh air. Or... however you'd describe the quality of the air on the edge of Tartarus. You know she'd never mean you any harm, right? In her mind... I think she's trying to keep it friendly between us."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Eugh, she said the same thing to me. Look, you know what, fine. If that's the only way to get her to take a break from this place, I guess it's for the best."

|"Hey, Meg, I understand you're under orders to kill me on sight out there, but... do you really have to go so hard on Sisyphus?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"That wretched shade isn't who you think he is. Do you have any idea of the magnitude of his crimes from when he led a mortal life?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He cheated death. Tricked Thanatos and maybe Father, too."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Before that, he did worse. He was an awful man. I think that is the real reason that your father punished him."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What if he's changed? Or... is that impossible. No coming back from certain crimes."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"No coming back from certain crimes, indeed. Though you may have more mercy in your heart to spare than I in mine."

|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"A proposition, Zagreus? Let's hear it, then. While I'm in a charitable mood."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's about Sisyphus. If I can get my father to alleviate his sentence, would you just... ease off of him, a little bit? You and your sisters. I think he's suffered quite enough under your whips."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"I don't know what you see in him, I swear. But you don't need to ask such things of me. If you can overturn his sentence with Lord Hades, I'd like nothing better than to never see that miserable shade again."

|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Hey, Prince Z. Must look like I'm slacking off with the old boulder, here, but... I was just getting back on my feet. The Fury Sisters don't often leave me be. Where'd they go, anyway? And... what are you doing here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, you know, just out on a little stroll is all. Do me a favor, though, you see the Fury Sisters, let them know I was headed down the way I came from, will you...?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh I'll let them know, all right, I hear you loud and clear, Your Highness. I'll just go about my business now, and you take care."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 02 A
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"You know, Prince Z., I'd not expected to run into you again, not after all this time. Something amiss down in the House, or what? Not had much company of late, is all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, something's just about always amiss back home, sir. Figured it couldn't hurt to check up on things in Tartarus a bit more frequently."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well I am grateful for it, I and the old boulder there, in turn. I'm used to going lengthy stretches on my own, but having visitors from time to time would do me well!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 02
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"If I may be so bold, Your Highness, I was wondering... what brings you back around this way again? Same story as last time?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Look, I have to level with you, Sisyphus. I'm leaving the House. I've had quite enough. You understand, I'm sure. I'm going to the surface."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"''Whew'', that is quite an undertaking, Prince. If it wasn't you yourself proposing it, I'd like to call it madness, truth be told. Though you're just mad enough to pull it off! Well hey, I hope you make it. Good fortune out there!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 03
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Hey Prince how goes the old escape plan, any luck?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know it's been all right, all things considered. Dying now and then, and it's been hard, but hey, what can you do."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Ah, well, keep your chin up. Me, why I quit trying to get out of here a while back, but, if I was a fire-stepping youngster like yourself, perhaps I would have stuck to it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 04
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Hey, Your Highness, anything the matter, or just passing through? Happy that we get to chat like this of late, of course."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, don't take this the wrong way, but... why are you helping me? My father's stuck you here for an eternity of torment and even still, you greet me with a smile, time after time."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"''Hah''! Come now, Prince Z., that's just the way I am! Besides, you're not your father, thank the gods! You always seemed a decent lad to me, and if you're saying you want out of here, why, I suppose I can relate, is all."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting About Fury 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"You know, Prince, it's been good not having to see those Fury Sisters quite as much lately. The main one, what's her name, she's on your case now, isn't she."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You mean Megaera. She's on my case all right. Under strict orders not to let me out of Tartarus. I guess that means you've got yourself a break! About damn time they gave one to you, sir."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, quick question, Sisyphus, you seen the other Fury Sisters lately?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Not seen the other Fury Sisters in some time now that you mention it! Just Megaera, the kindly one, and she is quite a handful on her own. I'll keep an eye out for the other two!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 06
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, how can you stand it, being here like this? You always seem in such good spirits, though."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"You push old Bouldy here sufficient times, and you might get a different outlook on things, too. With the Furies all preoccupied and with my running into you from time to time, I'm positively doing great lately. I like to take what pleasures I can get!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 07
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Look here, Bouldy, Prince Z. himself has come to visit us!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Does Bouldy really keep you company? Personally I would resent a giant boulder that keeps tumbling back down a hill after I push it all the way up there."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh, Bouldy's not so bad, I mean, he's a good listener, a good shoulder to lean on, doesn't wield a whip... I rightly can't complain! Good having company down here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus About Bouldy 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know I was just thinking, sir... sometimes I am a little envious of you and Bouldy there. You seem to have things pretty figured out. I still grow frustrated with myself quite often and don't always know whom to turn to."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh, ''hah''! Well, I just think you're in a tough spot lately, Prince. But you'll get through! As for old Bouldy, why, by all means do not hesitate to lay your troubles on him if you like! Dumped all of mine on him a while back."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So I can just... walk up and talk to him, and chat? That's all it takes?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"That's truly all it takes to make a friend sometimes, indeed, Highness. Now, here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus About Bouldy 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have to thank you, Sisyphus, not just for all the help you've given me time after time, but for encouraging me to have a chat with Bouldy there. I daresay I feel a little more at peace of late, and maybe it's thanks to him."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"He's a good one, all right, isn't he? Though if you've come to such an understanding with old Bouldy there, why, it must mean you've done some growing on your own as well, I think."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus About Alecto 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You ever meet Alecto, Sisyphus? The Fury Megaera's nastier sister. We recently became acquainted, she and I."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Ah, fortunately I've not seen too much of her, myself, Prince Z. And based on everything that I have seen and heard, I'd like to keep it that way for a while! I hope she doesn't cause you too much trouble there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, have you had run-ins with Tisiphone the Fury here before? She isn't much for conversation, I don't think."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Tisiphone. Why, yes, I have, in fact, Prince Z. She's visited on multiple occasions, truth be told. So she is back, is she?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She is. Although, I think she's back to deal with me. I'll have to keep her plenty busy just in case."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Appreciate it, Prince. Of all the Fury Sisters, she's the one I would least care to see. But if she does stop by, you know, that's how it goes."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting 08
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Look, Prince, I don't hold grudges, you know that. Push this boulder long as I have, you move past the petty stuff. So, just want you to know, in case you make it out this time, it's been a real pleasure."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Feeling's mutual, sir. Someday you'll have to tell me all about how you tricked Father. I might learn a thing or two."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Backstory 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Say, tell me something, Prince, if you don't mind. How come you're so intent on getting out of here? I mean, what happens when you do?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, you ever lose somebody dear to you? There's someone out there whom I need to find. That's... all that I can say right now."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"I get it, Highness, and I didn't mean to pry, it's just... I can't remember what it's like to want something so bad, you know? Whoever's out there, I hope you find them soon."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Backstory 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey sir, I've always wondered, what were you like back when you were alive? Were you always this wise?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Might surprise you, Highness, I've a bit of royalty in me, myself. Not on your level, mind, but I was very much a king. Though I'll be honest, I... I wasn't much of a good man."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Huh''! I thought I sensed the royalty in you! Although, I can't imagine you as anything besides the gentleman I know you for, my friend."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well that is awful kind of you to say. Though, I would like to think my punishment here wasn't without warrant. At least I've had a lot of time to think it through!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Backstory 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Sisyphus, you mind my asking what you did to warrant this particular arrangement you've got here? Pushing a boulder till the end of time and all. Never heard it in your own words."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, it's a bit of a long story, Prince. My time had come, though I just wasn't ready, you might say. Your father thought he had me in his clutches, but then, ''shoom''! I gave him the slip. Your father's henchman, Thanatos, he'll back me up on that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Outsmarted Thanatos, that's amazing... what happened then?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Turns out your father doesn't like us mortals cheating death. Eventually they found me, so, now I'm stuck here with my boulder friend. I push old Bouldy up the hill to the beat of the Furies' whips, then he tumbles down, and then we go again."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So then, you're stuck forever, no reprieve. That's terrible... wish there was something I could do to help."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"You save those sympathies for someone else, Your Highness! I could be Prometheus, spending an eternity having my liver gobbled up, but instead I get to stay in shape, and have these chats with you. Now I'd better get back to it!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Backstory 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, I've meant to ask, where are you getting all this stuff you give to me? You must be pretty well connected around here."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh, well, you know! I have acquaintances amongst the locals here, try to be neighborly with everyone is all. It's not just Bouldy and myself as you can see. Sometimes I come across things that'd be better off in other hands than mine."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Backstory 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have to tell you, Sisyphus. Sometimes I wish I knew more about your past. You must have been a great king."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, ''ah-hah'', the thing is that I wasn't, Highness. And that's not modesty from me, all right? All behind me, now. And I'd appreciate it if we left it at that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I hear you, sir. Though, whatever you did in your mortal days... you've since more than paid for it, I'm sure.... Wait, is that why you're still here, in Tartarus? Because you think you deserve this?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"It's more like... this is where I belong. Where my path has taken me, you know? Here in the Underworld, you can't entirely escape your past... and yet, it's like you get another life to live. With all the wisdom that you picked up along the way."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Backstory 06
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"You know, Prince Z., you really have a look about you that you know exactly where you're going, as of late. I used to think you weren't near as comfortable in your own skin."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, you were right. I was never comfortable performing Father's routine Tartarus inspections. Though those responsibilities of mine didn't last long."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Nor did we have much opportunity to chat back then, but hey! You always struck me as a decent sort. Wasn't accustomed to your father's henchpeople greeting me with a smile."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, I know you tend to be in remarkably good spirits, all things considered, but there must be something I can do to help with your predicament, isn't there?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh, come now, Prince, do Bouldy and I look like we could use your charity? We're planning to stay put within this chamber for a while. It's hardly a predicament, I'd say."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But, what of the Furies and their torments and all that? They might be back and make all this more difficult for you."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Ah, yes, the Fury Sisters, well. I wouldn't mind seeing them more infrequently now that you mention it, but either way! So don't you even worry about me. Now, here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have good news, sir! I located the contract binding you, and bought it out. It's null and void. You're free to go!"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh! Indeed, then, does this mean, Prince, then... the Fury Sisters, they won't come around as often anymore?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Not just that, Sisyphus! You can make your way someplace else, where other decent shades reside! You know, somewhere with fewer chains and torture devices and such?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"You're much too kind to this old soul, Prince Z. The thing is, this is home. For me and Bouldy, it is what it is. Though, knowing that the Furies won't be visiting with quite their former regularity, that is a load off. Heavier than Bouldy, there."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You mean you're really going to stay? Even though you don't have to?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Is that so odd, Highness? Don't see myself lugging old Bouldy out of here, besides! And if I were to leave, why, we would not be having these exchanges now and then. I happen to enjoy them quite a bit! Now, here you go, and thank you, very much."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Must say, Prince Z., the free life sure does have its perks down here! This place really isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Glad to hear it, sir. But you're still here... the same as ever. Is it really all that different from the way it always was?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, it used to be I'd have to start heaving Bouldy there at any point, if the Fury Sisters decided to show up. But now? I just get to relax, chat a bit with the other shades, and give you one of these when you're in the area!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 02
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Ah, there you are, Prince! I was just thinking about how grateful I am that you got me out of that contract with your father. It's been a real weight off my shoulders, truth be told."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You never seemed particularly concerned even before, sir. Must say you're very good at hiding your worries."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"And I could say the same to you! Look, I know you were concerned for my wellbeing. Now you don't have to be. And I'll still be around to help you out. Good feeling, isn't it?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 03
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"You must have seen everything there is to see here in your father's Underworld, haven't you, Prince? I figure that there isn't any place nicer than this!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh! Well, I suppose now that you're free, you could always see for yourself? It's pretty different as soon as you reach Asphodel. Don't you have someplace or somebody you'd like to see?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"I'll take what's coming to me right here, thank you very much. You're the wayfaring sort, but my wayfaring days are over. It's hard to explain, but... this is a much-needed fresh start for me."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus High Relationship 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"I will have you know, Prince, that your visits here have become a very important part of my routine!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And what routine is that, exactly, sir?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Why, the routine of looking forward, of course! I try to appreciate the moment as much as anybody, but you know? It's always nice having something to look forward to. So, see you next time, then?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting Fury Victorious 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"I heard straight from the source the Fury Megaera's been giving you a time, there, hasn't she. Trust me I know the feeling, so, I'm grateful that you're here and that she's not. You give her hell for me next time, won't you?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh I'll get her for the both of us one of these days. Nights? Whenever."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Hey Prince, I heard you showed that Fury Sister the what-for, is that the truth? Might explain why I've been left here to my own devices for a change."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't think she'll be out of commission for very long. She'd best find you minding that boulder, though at least you managed to catch a break for now. Be seeing you, Sisyphus."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 02
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Now you be careful out there, Highness. The kindly Megaera is out for blood. She kept on groaning 'bout the last exchange between the two of you. You must have showed her good!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think I might have gotten lucky."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Hey, Prince Z., I heard the strangest rumor, here's the thing, I'll give it to you straight. I have heard you've been consorting both with Megaera the Fury and with that old stiff, Thanatos, can you believe it?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, I don't know where you heard that, but... it's true. They're... they're just doing their jobs, and I... I know how it looks, but... you're my friend, as well, and I don't want you to forget that."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"I... look, I do appreciate the sentiment, Your Highness, I'm just surprised. I thought we shared a common foe in them, is all. What can I say, I hope that someday I can see them how you see them."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you for understanding, sir. Besides... maybe I can get them to cut you some slack."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Sisyphus, I have to be up front with you. The Fury Megaera and Thanatos... I know you're not exactly on the best of terms with either one of them. But they're both close to me. You won't hold it against me, sir, will you?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Look, Prince, it's not for me to judge you, or your friends. The Fury Sisters, Master Thanatos... we got off on the wrong foot, you could say. My fault, entirely. I'd sooner make sure that our correspondence here doesn't make those relationships more difficult."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Don't even say that, sir. I think Meg and Than know me better than that by now. Well, thanks for understanding, as always."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Certainly, Highness. And who knows? Perhaps as you spend more time together, some of your finer qualities will rub off on those two!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus About Thanatos Relationship 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"How goes it with old Master Thanatos of late, Prince Z.? Is he at least less stern with you than with the poor mortals he's sent to take in here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, Thanatos is doing all right. Much like my father, I think he feels he has some sort of fearsome reputation to uphold. Or maybe he's perpetually stressed over his work. But he's been well lately."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"That's good, I guess! Always appreciated that he ultimately took me in, rather than having to show up here through much more sudden, much more painful means. Didn't stop me from trying to avoid the trip, of course."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Run Progress 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Word is you've caused quite the hubbub in Elysium, Prince Z.! Making the champion up there really work for it, I hear?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You could say that, I guess! Apparently word gets around. That Theseus, though... he doesn't care for me one bit, let me tell you!"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"I bet he'd like you better if you were a regular pushover! Ah, well, he'll learn, I'm sure."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Run Cleared 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Prince, you've been gone for quite a while, why... I heard-tell you made it all the way outside! And I believed it for a while there, yet here you are. What happened, might I ask?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I made it out of here, indeed, sir. I always said that I was leaving, but... turns out there was good reason for me to come back. Not the least of which is visiting my friends from time to time."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, I am certainly delighted to hear that! So long as you achieved what you set out to do. But, what brings you back again this way? More than a social visit I presume."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're right. I'm back because... I'm leaving once again. Something I have to do if I get up there, though I should be back before long either way, I guess."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Going to try and make it out of here again and again, is it? Well they say repetition is the key to mastery, Prince Z. Now here, I'll send you on your way."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Run Cleared 02
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"So, how do you like the surface, hey, Prince Z.? Now that you've finally had a chance to see it for yourself. Not too bad, I hope?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It takes some getting used to, that's for sure. I'm not sure I'll ever grow completely accustomed to it. Do you miss it, sir?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh, you know. I still have almost everything that matters, and the rest? It makes for precious memories I didn't have up there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Post Ending 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"So, all this time, Prince, when you were battling up to the surface, and all that... you were searching for ''her'', weren't you? The Queen?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I was. Although, between us, sir, it's important that you keep that one a secret, please. Did... you happen to meet her, ever?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, just the one time, briefly, when your father decided to put me here. And, you have my word, of course. About the... surface stuff."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Prince Z., my understanding is the Queen herself is back, is that correct? Moreover, I have heard a truly fascinating rumor about her..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That I'm her son...? It's true, sir. And she's back with us for now, indeed. I think we're all still getting used to it, but... it feels good, having her in my life."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"That's wonderful to hear. I'd always heard good things about that one. No wonder such a quality runs in the family."
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Post Epilogue 02
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Just one thing I don't understand, Prince Z., if you'll indulge me for a moment, here. If everything is all right for you at the House, then... why is it you're fighting to the surface, still?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, you know. Wouldn't want Father to get too comfortable thinking this place is foolproof. It has a terrifyingly ominous reputation to uphold! ''There is no escape''."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Sure, that makes sense! Well, from a certain point of view. Escape over and over to prove it can't be done! I like that. Well, let's both of us keep at it, then!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus Post Epilogue 03
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Not working yourself ''too ''hard of late, are you, Prince Z.? Remembering to take some breaks from time to time, and all?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think I'm managing, thanks, sir. Though, back when you pushed Bouldy rather than talked to him... I suppose you didn't have much of a choice, did you?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, it was work, you know? Even your Father has to work. Of course, I've since retired! But it seems you and he like to keep yourselves occupied. Whatever makes you feel content."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey sir, certainly it's been most welcome having something from you with me at all times. Though has it always held this power? And... how did you remove it to begin with?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Bit of an odd story, that. Involved a well-timed accident with the old boulder there. Though, I'd best not get into it so that you're not accomplice to that little crime. Surely you understand?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Sisyphus About Keepsake 02
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanks, sir. It's been of help through my repeated treks across this realm, all thanks to you. You sure you don't want it back?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"''Hahahahah''! Absolutely not, though truly I appreciate the sentiment. I'd rather have a look at the old boulder there than a symbol of the time I first got stuck here, when I wasn't doing quite as well."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You heard correctly, Sisyphus! Orpheus is reunited with his muse, at last. Or at least, he gets to visit on the regular, when he isn't busy at my father's house. So you've heard of them, have you?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Oh, I've more than heard of them! I'm sure you know how Orpheus once ventured all the way down here, after Eurydice passed on. I'll never forget his song! Even the Fury Sisters gave me a break, they were so captivated by it, then. ''Ah'', good times. For me, at least!"

|-

|"He is, sir, and I'm grateful once again to have adopted him. You sure you don't want him back, though? Always seems like you could use a friend."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"All due respect, Highness, but I've the best friend anyone can ask for to my right just there. And as for little Shady, he was more inclined than I to see the farthest reaches of the Underworld. Safe travels to you both!"

|"Sisyphus, sir? Have you any idea how Shady works? I'm able to just whisk both you and Bouldy out of here, and to my aid? It must be awfully disorienting."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, Prince, I told you that we'd be with you in spirit, didn't I? It's not just Shady's power, I suppose, nor is it Bouldy's or my hidden strength. It's testament to our companionship, is all. You gods are capable of anything!"

|-

|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Why, Prince, is this...? It is...! I've not so much as seen a bottle of it, much less sampled it, thank you so much! Although, with all respect, I cannot rightfully accept such a fine gift. Unless..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Unless...? Oh no, you're not making me take something in return, you know this was a gift not an exchange, sir, right? Wait, what is that?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"This, Highness, is a little friend of mine kept tucked away in Bouldy's care. Wherever you'll be going next, he'll make a worthy traveling companion. And when he's with you, Bouldy and I... we'll be with you in spirit, too."

|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"All this, for someone such as me. You know I'm down here for a reason, don't you, Prince? Not just because your father and good Thanatos don't care for me. Yet, from the very first, you showed me decency I'd not experienced since I was a king. Perhaps not even then."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Whoever it was you used to be, sir, I believe you've changed. And I'm proud to say that you're my friend. And Bouldy there as well. It's odd for me to say, but I am glad you're here. I think I've learned a lot from you, about all this."
|-

|"Oh, you know, it's going. That I've been able to make it this far means I am getting somewhere, I suppose. No thanks to all your brethren in Elysium."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"No use trying to reason with my brethren here. Many of the shades whom you've encountered, why, I watched them throw away their lives when they were men. Yet still they seek to prove to one another and themselves that they are great warriors."

|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"He's just as obstinate as ever, isn't he? Always refused to budge. He ever tell you of the war in which we fought? ''I ''fought, I should say. He could have ended it. But he refused to take up arms."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles hasn't been particularly forthcoming about his mortal days, no. So he wouldn't fight? I've heard that mortals sometimes frown on that, but... why should he have fought if he didn't believe in the cause?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"He ''shared ''our cause! So what if it was not completely his? If not for his stubbornness, I... well... I would have come here just a bit later, I think."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He blames himself for what happened to you, you know. I figured he failed to defend you or something, not that... he didn't fight at all. Although, he said something about how, once you died, he shortly followed in a rage..."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"I wouldn't know a thing about that, stranger, for you see... I was already dead. Getting my place here in the afterlife all sorted out. Took quite some time, getting accustomed to all this."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Achilles 05
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"A question, if you don't mind, stranger? Because, I've had one nagging at me since we last discussed the subject. What, exactly, happened to Achilles, can you say? After I died, that is. I've heard the rumors, but... I don't trust any of this boastful lot."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, from what I gathered, sir... after you fell, he was overcome with grief. And anger. He joined the war, just like you urged. And, single-handedly, he almost ended it."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"So then, he threw away his life. Soon enough after I lost mine. Yet, despite vanquishing an army on his own, he wound up in the lowest pits of Tartarus? Instead of here, among the great?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You should know, sir. You were buried together. Your ashes, that is. It was his final request. As for how he came to be at my father's house, that's something I think he can best explain. And I will do everything I can to make sure that he has the opportunity."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"...Our ashes, you say. Together? ''Tsk. ''The fool. We could have lived! Not been reduced to meal for the worms. But... I appreciate the information, stranger. Now... please, go."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Achilles 06
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"...Forgive me, stranger. For, in retrospect, I was too terse after you told me what became of my Achilles. Tales of his climactic battle, I had heard. The stuff about... his ashes, and my own... that was all new."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No need to even ask forgiveness, sir. Achilles is one of my closest friends, but.. he doesn't care to talk about himself. About those times. It must be very painful. For the both of you."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Oh, we've all seen our share of pain, by now. But... knowing that he cared for me, in the end... ''after ''the end... it dulls the feeling of it, for a bit. As do these conversations, I guess."

|"I've meant to ask you something, stranger. Would you mind doing me a favor, please? If it happens to come up along your path. Suppose I ought to tell it to you first, prior to asking a response."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, of course, sir, what is it? What's on your mind?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"If I know my Achilles, then he's being rather guarded, when it comes to this predicament we're in. How can somebody be so brash yet hate to take unnecessary risks? Just let him know I said to risk it all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Risk it all? Risk ''what ''all? He wants what's best for you. He wouldn't want anything to happen."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"It's already long since happened. I daresay that, right now, provided what you've said is true, then... it appears we've more to gain than lose. Isn't fear for the weak?"

|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"He really can't. Though I keep telling him, it's true. Nothing's accomplished without risk, isn't that so? But, we of course have you to thank, stranger. Our troubles needn't have been your concern."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nonsense, sir. You're my friend. And Achilles... I don't know where I would even be, if not for you."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Well, no need to get emotional, is there? We myrmidons, we're not the sentimental type. Achilles is simply on break, is all. From a demanding job. You've a demanding job as well, so here! My customary gift."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus With Achilles 02
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Well if it isn't the ward of Achilles, come to visit us. I don't know how I can ever repay you, stranger. I'm quite sure that it isn't possible."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I reached more or less the same conclusion, Pat."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"How about you just keep offering me those premium goods you have no interest in when I pass through, and we can call it even, sir?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"That I had plans to do, regardless, though... if you should think of something else at any point, please do let either of us know."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus With Achilles 03
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Good, there you are, stranger. Settle something for us quickly, hm? Would Achilles not make for the perfect Champion of Elysium? For I think almost anybody would be better than the current one."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I think I'd rather maintain watch over a nearly empty hall than battle all the shades around here, Pat."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I, too, would vastly prefer having to contend with Theseus rather than yourself, Achilles. Although, that's not to say I disagree that almost anybody would be better in the role than him."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"It seems, then, I am overruled. But I know Champion material when I see it, and I see it now."
|-

|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Achilles is returned to work for now... but, waiting for him, knowing he'll return... rather than waiting for the sake of it, for nothing... such a different feeling, stranger. I'd forgotten it entirely, I think."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm happy for the both of you. So, is everything all right, then? The circumstances under which you were separated in life... it's unimaginable, really. How does one move on from a thing like that?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Anger fades, I guess, stranger. Even the famous anger of Achilles. Anger burns hot, then burns out. What's left is a dull ache, but... underneath it, there was something else. It felt as though... well, I was still alive. That feeling... it's worth holding onto."
|-

|-

|"Don't mind at all, Patroclus, sir. Coming from you I consider it a term of endearment."
|-

|"You have my thanks for that..."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think so, sir. I'll still be passing through, and visiting the surface every opportunity I get. But it seems my place really is here. Besides, it means getting to see you every now and then, like this."
|-

|"That sounds agreeable to me. Then, you take care."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus Post Epilogue 01

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's a long story, at this point, indeed. But yes. The Queen... my mother... she's returned. And, it's been really good, having her back."
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Keepsake 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"This spearpoint that you gave me, sir. It's been quite useful, though I have to ask you... is there any particular significance to it? Most spearpoints aren't imbued with power such as this."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Oh, that. Just something I'd been meaning to get rid of, but... it can be difficult, discarding trifles from the past. Knowing it's provided you some benefit is welcome news."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Keepsake 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Did you once wield a spear yourself, sir? In your fighting days?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Did I once wield a spear? You could say that I did. I had my moments with it, anyway. Even once slew a demigod! He's probably somewhere about. Quite awkward, running into those you killed. But in Elysium it's all taken in stride."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About War 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Whatever happened with that war you mentioned, sir? If you don't mind my asking."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Well, truth be told, here, stranger... I do mind. You speak as one who's not experienced a war. Those of us who survived... or, you know what I mean... we do bear some responsibility to history. But, all the same, it's not a time and place to which I would return. I trust you'll understand."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Young Achilles 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I always wondered, sir. What was Achilles like...? During his youth, I mean. If you can say."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"''Hah''. How to describe what somebody was like? Everyone who saw him on the battlefield agreed he was magnificent, stranger. His allies and his enemies alike. But, there was more to him, I think. A certain outlook. A sense of justice. I knew him before he was a warrior. Only reason I suppose I liked him."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Theseus 01
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"I heard you've vanquished Theseus however many times of late. Or... someone matching your description has, stranger. Almost had to laugh when I heard that. Though, I suspect he hasn't learnt a thing."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you know him? Though, yes, he does seem rather set in his ways. Convinced himself that I'm some sort of demon from the lowest depths. Which... well, it's partly true, I guess."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"You're quite notorious, around these parts. The tales of your father's monstrous son, kept under lock and key within his House. Fear and ignorance make for great stories, no?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Theseus 02
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Couldn't help but hear the rattling of battle chariots of late. Raucous laughter and the like. You've really riled up the locals this time, stranger."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Must be Theseus and his fancy Macedonian. So he's been joyriding about in that thing? Showing it off?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Your arrivals are becoming a bit of an event, I'd say. And, yes, the Champion and his bull friend are likely at the center of it. You'll have to forgive me that I've no intent on attending your contests, but... well, here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Theseus 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, for such a loudmouth obnoxious braggart, Theseus does seem to have formed a strong kinship with the Bull of Minos, hasn't he. Are they truly as inseparable as they seem? I feel bad for the Bull."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Sometimes it's our differences that make us drawn to one another, no? And, at other times, there's no accounting for taste. I often don't know which is which, and they can have each other, far as I'm concerned."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Minotaur 01
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Even the Bull of Minos couldn't stop you, huh. That's one whose way I would stay out of if I could, but... well, you'd not be here if you couldn't handle yourself, I guess."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You heard I battled with Asterius, here, sir? I thought you kept more to your own devices. Weren't much for conversation with the other shades."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Oh, you're correct in that assessment, stranger. But, as you've seen, I've no ability to stop others from coming and going as they please. So I do tend to hear a thing or two from passersby."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Heroes 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You must have met so many great heroes in your day, having fought alongside Achilles... do you still keep in touch with any of them, here?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Great heroes... haven't you seen, by now, what they are like, stranger? Not all entirely what they're cracked up to be. But, there were good ones, yes. Suppose they're mostly keeping to themselves. Like I am here. Perhaps we'll run into each other, down the line."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Gods 01
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Never quite considered... you're related to the gods upon Olympus, aren't you, stranger...? I should be far more careful around you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What do you mean by that, sir? Though, yes, my father being who he is, it means I have a lot of uncles, cousins, and the like, up on the surface, there."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Well... you would be wise to watch yourself, with some of them, I think. Don't get on anyone's bad side, if you can help it. Which, when I yet lived, none of us could."
|-

|"I have been, sir. Or, I should say, I am."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Ah, that's good. Cling to the feeling, then. And if you lose it... reach for it. Search for it, no matter what, all right? Because, without it... well, there isn't much of a comparison, I think."

|"Not sure that I have been, sir. I understand it's one of those things where, you'll know it when it happens."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Perhaps you shall, someday or night down here. The feeling comes with pain, and plenty of it, but... the pain is worth it, in my limited experience. And once you find that feeling, cling to it. As tightly as you can. If you don't mind my saying."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You sure you don't need any of this stuff, sir? I really appreciate it, but... I don't want to take it for granted."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Oh, come, this is Elysium. Taking such things for granted is the point. We gloried shades receive our stipend of the finest goods, so we can battle till we've had our fill. But I've already had my fill, I think."
|-
! colspan="2" |Patroclus About Fishing 01
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"You've ample time for fishing, have you, stranger? And here I thought you'd more important business to attend to, though it's not for me to judge, I guess."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'll have you know some of us take matters of fishing very seriously, sir! Besides... helps take my mind off having to fight your Elysian brethren nonstop."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Oh I'd not take your mind off this fight if it's one that you hope to win, stranger. I once took my mind off a fight, and, well... I wound up here."

|"Oh, I'm a little rusty. But he's not. Still very much in tiptop shape, except more able to control his temper, I should think."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Don't sell yourself so short! Though, I thought you laid down your spear forever. Why choose to fight again?"
|-

|"You'd give the precious gift of Ambrosia to someone like me, stranger? A gloried thing like that. Why bother...? I should be just another shade to you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, you're not. You're someone I look forward to seeing here in Elysium, which is more than I can say for just about anybody else around here, so... please, enjoy it. Perhaps with Achilles."
|-

|'''Patroclus'''
|"You're thanking ''me'', stranger? I've been here for some time, I think, and yet... some of your customs I'll admit remain quite strange to me. You've done more for me than I've any right to expect, from anyone."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's just a bottle of Ambrosia, sir, it's really no big deal. OK, fine, it's rather difficult to come by, but still!"

|"''Erm''... yes, I do believe I can. Look, I didn't mean to upset you."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Yeah, well, neither did he! But you know what? Actions beat intentions, hon. Now, here, how about a treat and you can be on your way."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Orpheus 02
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"What is it, hon? Oh no, don't tell me you've come all the way from Tartarus to ask me more about your good-for-nothing court musician friend."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Certainly not! I'm merely here for your wonderful singing, cooking, or conversational ability. Though, since you mentioned it, you... seem to have a lot to say to him. Is there anything I can do?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"So let me see if I understand. Orpheus blew it with me like an idiot, but now I'm supposed to be reaching out to ''him''? Sorry, hon, but that's not happening. The two of us are finished. And, you know what? I think we're finished here, too. If you'll excuse me!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Orpheus 03
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Hey there, hon! So what do you think, pretty good tune, right? Don't know how come everybody doesn't sing. Lightens the mood, passes the time. What's not to like?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's a beautiful song. Even though you're angry with him... Orpheus, I mean... you're always singing, still?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Oh it's not Orpheus' song, you kidding me? This one's all mine. He always did like going on about how I'm his muse, well, that's 'cause I wrote half his songs for him! Bet he didn't mention that, did he."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, not exactly in those words, but... Orpheus can be a little hard to parse."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"He can be a little hard to tolerate. A quality I hope isn't going to rub off on any of his mates. I should get back to practicing, see you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Orpheus 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Look, Eurydice, I promise not to bother you with this each time, but... you should know your husband's shattered by what happened with the two of you. He's genuinely sorry, and he loves you very deeply, still, I'm sure of it."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"''Tsk''... and what am I supposed to do with that, Your Royal Majesty...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I... I don't know yet. Though, you know what? You shouldn't take my word for it. You should take his."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Don't think I will be running into him anytime soon from what I understand. But you're the Hades kid! You want to pull some strings on our behalf, go right ahead, I guess. But I won't hold my breath. Even if I could."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Progress With Orpheus 01
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"So, ''uh'', how's Orpheus been doing lately, anyway? Still keeping his hair in those neat little curls? I guess his tan must have faded by now."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Curls? ''Erm'', not exactly, no. But he's doing all right! For him. He's started singing again, lately, which was a big step. He never used to, before. Would go on about how he'd lost his muse."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"And now he knows I'm out there, still, huh. That's... well, thank you for the update, hon. Music's his gift. Good to know he's not thrown everything away."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Progress With Orpheus 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Eurydice, can I ask you for a favor here? Not that you owe me anything, but, would you hear me out?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Yeah, sure, hon, what is it? Though you had better not be asking for my recipes. Closely guarded family secret! I'd say I'd take them to my grave, but... yeah."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's not your recipes, though they are wonderful. It's your song. I'm sure it'd be a hit around the House! And, I know someone who really needs to hear it. Don't suppose you've got a parchment-copy I could have?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Your Royal Majesty, you want my ''song''? You are aware it's called '''Good Riddance''', right? ''Tsk'', but sure, why not. If music's going to be playing in your House, it might as well be great. And let me give you something to go with it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Progress With Orpheus Song Reaction 01
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"...What'd he say, hon? I mean about the song. Bet he loved it, didn't he! But, I don't know for sure. And I've been wondering, kind of a lot, I guess."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No need to wonder any longer. He sings it beautifully, around the House sometimes. It... has a sadder sound to it than when you sing, but... you've inspired him again. As you've done many times before, from what I know."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Huh. So it's a hit, is what you're saying, then. I had a feeling about that one. Sometimes you put some words together and right then and there, you know that you've got something special."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Progress With Orpheus 03
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"What happens now, hon...? What I mean is... now you got me thinking about Orpheus again, so... what am I supposed to do with that?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Even if you can't be together right now, I hope it feels better knowing how much he cares for you. And I will try to pull some strings, like you said. I can't make promises where my father's concerned, but... I'll do everything I can."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Well, what can I tell you? Thanks, Your Royal Majesty. That means a lot. No pressure, though. I've been all right without him all this time, and I will be all right, no matter what. If only he could say the same."
|-

|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Hey, listen here a moment, Hades kid. Look, I... Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. For bringing Orphy back to me again, and everything."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Eurydice, you're more than welcome, really. You've helped me through the flames of hell, time after time. Least I could do is coax old Orpheus out of his private pit of despair so you and he could set things right between the two of you."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Well, you're a real sweetheart, hon. You'll still be seeing Orphy all the time around your House, but now, I get to see him, too. Nice having something to look forward to, you know? Bet someone out there feels that about you."
|-

|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Hey! What's the matter, Your Royal Majesty? You're looking kind of down. Normally you're all smiles, for whatever reason!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, I... well, looking back, all this stuff between you and Orpheus, I realized... well, I hope I wasn't too pushy about the whole thing. It wasn't any of my business to pry into your personal life. I should have asked."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Oh, that? ''Pff'', come on, don't even worry about it. If you were being too pushy, you better believe I would have put you back in your place, royalty or not. But hey, can't ever be too careful when it comes to people's past and feelings and stuff, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Got to tell you, hon. Orpheus sure is different since last he and I met. You know, back when he was still living and breathing and all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think the experience of trying to rescue you, failing, dying, becoming court musician, refusing to sing, then being locked in solitary confinement, then finding out about you probably did a number on him. Why, is everything all right? You seemed to be getting along last I saw."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Oh, we're getting along great! Better than ever. He used to be a bit more of a hotshot, but now it's like, he's a little more... what's the word... sensitive? Now I can always tell exactly what's on his mind."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 04
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Hey, Your Royal Majesty! I must say you've accomplished some truly amazing feats, according to Orphy at least! But don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, no, he's been boasting of my fabricated exploits to you? I've tried to tell him I was only joking with him but now he just thinks I'm being modest."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"That modesty won't get you anywhere with me, either, hon, Your Greatness. I'm honored to merely be in the presence of one with so many wild exploits to sing or speak of!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey did Orpheus really use to have curls, and... something called a tan? I've only ever seen him looking... well, how he does now."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"He did! And a tan is like... well, when you stay out in the hot sun up there long enough, your skin kind of starts to bake a little bit. But nicer than that sounds! Got to say, though, the years have been kind to Orphy, don't you think?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Say, tell me something, there, Your Royal Majesty. You know a lot of shades. You wouldn't happen to know an Orpheus, would you? Spindly little thing, whiny voice? Heard he's officially serving in your court. Making music!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Of course I know Orpheus, we're mates! Wait, why do you ask?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"You're mates, huh. Just as long as you don't count on him for anything. Hasn't even mentioned me, has he. Well if he ever does, you tell him I am doing great! I'm great."
|-

|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"What's the latest, hon, anything been happening down in your fancy House lately?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, you mentioned Orpheus... my father had him locked up for a little while for refusing to sing. Being court musician and all. But he's out now, and doing OK! I think."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Not following instructions, huh. Sounds like Orpheus, all right. Well, if that's the most exciting thing you've got going on, then I haven't missed much being out here."
|-

|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Hey, what's up, hon? Say, you must know a lot of big shots, don't you? Other gods and all that?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I know a few. As a matter of fact, I heard recently from Hermes, wanted you to know he felt sorry for how things ended up. That something to do with when Orpheus went in here after you?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Oh, that's sweet of him! Nice enough guy, for an Olympian. Yeah, he was the one who dropped me off here in the first place. No hard feelings here, he was just doing his job. It was Orpheus who messed everything up."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Nymphs 01
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Sure don't see a lot of other nymphs around here, huh! We don't die too easy, most of us. Makes me feel all special!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I've never met another nymph, now that you mention it. Heard of a few! The goddess Artemis, sounds like she spends more time with nymphs than the other Olympians."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"That's what I heard! Though it's not like we all hang out, I mean, you've got the dryads, and the naiads, and the nereids, and the oceanids... pretty much every type of terrain up top, there's a kind of nymph who loves it! Maybe we need a name for Underworld nymphs, too."
|-

|"Eurydice, did you by any chance ever meet a ''Persephone ''during the whole thing when Orpheus came down to try to get you?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Oh, her? Yeah, she was with Hades Senior, why? Wait. ''Whoa''. Are you...? I thought..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's complicated. And, please keep it quiet. I was just wondering... what was she like? If you recall."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Didn't get much of an impression, but I can tell you this: She had good taste in music! Orpheus and I, think we won her over with our little duet. Haven't seen or heard from her lately, though. Look, I hope everything's OK."

|-

|"Hey, everybody's saying Persephone... she's back? That sounds like a bit of good news, there, isn't that right, hon?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, she is back, and yes, it is good news, thank you. She and I have a lot of making up for lost time left to do, though I think we're off to a pretty decent start."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Well, that's a relief. And, you're still here! So I guess you've got more official business to take care of, which means I've still got somebody to taste-test for me every now and then!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Post Epilogue 02
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Orphy tells me the Queen, she's been settling in just fine down at your House! Must be different having a lady like that around. How's Hades Senior taking it, if I may ask?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, he's taking it... about as well as he's taken anything ever, now that you mention it. Still very much himself, mind you, but still... it's been a welcome change."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Glad to hear it! Orphy always liked singing for an audience more than I did, and it sounds like she's a good one."
|-

|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"You ever play any music, or sing or anything yourself, Hades kid? It's good for you, you know!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I play a bit of the lyre, as a matter of fact! Orpheus himself gave me some pointers on it. Never really tried singing, though. I can't even imagine it, really."

|"''Erm'', yes, but... wait. How else are you supposed to eat those things?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know what, yes, I do, Eurydice. Things have moved so fast for me lately I barely stopped to think about it, though. It helps not having to go through everything alone... just knowing I'll see them again soon."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Know what you mean. And hey, that's great! Long as you can still be yourself. I've known too many nymphs, their whole lives revolved around somebody they loved. I bet whoever it is that loves you... it's because of who you are."
|-

|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"How long have I been down here, hon? ''Huh''! I don't have the faintest. You lose your sense of time once you're a shade, or maybe once there's not a sun or moon over your head. But yeah, I found myself a decent spot and fixed it up a bit!"

|"You're just in time, Your Royal Majesty! Got something real good cooking right here that you are going to love. You hungry, yeah?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Am I ever. You're always so generous. And you're always cooking! And singing. Do you have many guests come by? Your place seems... somewhat off the beaten path."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"What, you think I get a lot of guests, here? ''Haha'', no, but I like cooking anyway! It's like singing, in a way. Keep getting better the more you try, turns out a bit different each time."
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Misc Meeting 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Eurydice, how can you cook so much with all the searing heat around these parts? Has it been magma-flooded like this all the time?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"The searing heat? ''Haha'', I am dead, Your Royal Majesty! Searing's just a cooking technique to me. Don't need to sleep, either! I can just keep cooking up a storm. It's not so bad!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice Misc Meeting 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, I've never met a nymph before. You're closer to the gods than mortals, right?"
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Yeah, gods that can ''die''! How is that fair? Was just a stupid snake bite in my case, can you imagine something more embarrassing? You're just minding your business, and then ''snap''! You're dead, and on your way down here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I... know the feeling better than you might expect."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Well, I was going to end up here sooner or later. Might as well while I'm still looking good. Though, I guess you do kind of get to lock in whatever age when you register. Bet everybody dying of old age pushed that one through."
|-

|"It's... look, the truth is, I am trying to get out of here. I've hit some stumbling blocks along the way, but, I think I will make it there, eventually."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Oh really! Say no more, I know how that is. Hope the Fates will look the other way for you. Getting out of here, huh. Not thought of that myself in I don't know how long..."
|-

|'''Eurydice'''
|"Of all the lava rocks in Asphodel, the Hades kid found this one once again, wouldn't you know! You got a map or something to this place, or what?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Don't know that a map would help me much since things keep shifting out here every single time. Though it is an interesting coincidence how I keep running into you."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Coincidence? Come on, hon, you're a god. Someone out there is sending you my way. Maybe it's just the Fates. Ah well! I sure don't mind a little company. And I have lots to eat!"

|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Oh, not just any plants, hon! Trees! Big gnarled oaks and things. Some of them live hundreds of years! Way up there as mortals go. You take good care of it like that, maybe it'll grow to be something special for you, too!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Eurydice About Acorn 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, this is sort of a weird question, but... this Evergreen Acorn, it's not... related to you, is it? Since, you know, you're... partly oak, aren't you?"
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, wait, you're onto something... I think you must have sensed Orpheus' Distant Memory! He gave it to me as a keepsake of our friendship. Though, something like this... I feel like it should belong to you."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think your culinary practice would be every bit as extraordinary, though I'm pleased to have done small service to you in this great pursuit."
|-
|'''Eurydice'''
|"Well, we both know you've done a lot more for me than that. I wasn't expecting to make any new friends here anytime soon, so all the more reason it's been a real treat to get to know you. If I may say? You're a hell of a guy, Your Royal Majesty."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...In short, I beat him, finally, though he did everything he could to prevent our meeting here like this. But there's something he wanted me to tell you, in the end. He said to tell you Cerberus is doing very well."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Ah''. He told you that, did he. That's good. That's good! Though, tell me something, Zagreus. How... is it that you found me? To have journeyed all this way, I scarce believe it.... Zagreus?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Ugh''... Oh, it's... guess I'm just a little tired, that's all. Not accustomed to the weather, as I think you call it."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"No... no, that isn't it, it's that... you cannot stay here. You can't stay here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Really, you're... ''heh''... kicking me out? Why?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"The Fates are cruel, Zagreus. You're bound to that place... same as your father. So they would have us say good-bye, for now. My heart soars, knowing you live. Then it breaks, that our time together was so brief."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No... I can... come back... I can come back, now that I found you, he... maybe he'll just let me come back."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"You tell him I demand it. And I demand he also tell me how come he, or for that matter Nyx, never sent notice that you lived! Olympus is all rife with schemers, but I was so naive to think that they were different."
|-

|"I'll tell him... I'll tell him, I... feel awful. I... I have to go."

|"The Styx shall take you, then. Oh, Zagreus. Farewell, my son. Won't you come back to me? When you are able, please. Come back. I shall be waiting here. However long it takes."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 02
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I begged the Fates that you'd return to me. Perhaps I ought to be more careful how I speak of them. Tell me, how was your journey? What happened?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Father didn't make it any easier for me. Nor would he tell me why he never sent for you, after you left. So, I don't know, what's going on, still, but... I wanted to see you, again."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I wanted to see you, too. Come, speak quickly with me, that our time together here may be as full as possible, all right?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I just... I need to know what happened, between you and Father. Why are you here, and not with us?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I couldn't live with myself anymore, down there. After I left Olympus, a long story in itself, I came to be with your father, in the Underworld. It was a shock, to say the least. The others in your father's house were welcoming enough, but... I never felt that I belonged."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I know the feeling, I think. But you stayed. Long enough to have me. Those whom I've spoken to about you, it's as you said, they have fond memories of you. And then, you even had a child. Did Father... did he mistreat you?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"No, no. Your father could be very difficult. Though, he was gentle, with me. Soon enough, we got on fine, better than fine, at times, but... when I was with child... why, I struggled terribly. Because... a child born of surface-dwellers could not live, down there."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Could not live down there, according to whom, exactly? The Fates?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"According to them, yes. According to your father, and to Nyx. Even having heard... I took my chances, anyway. But when you emerged stillborn... it was too much. I fled. I fled, and came to reside here. Above the notice of the Underworld. Beneath the notice of Olympus."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Urgh''... but... why would Father lie to you? If he never wanted you... or never wanted me... surely he had the means."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I don't know. I'm wondering the same. But, oh, look at you, Zagreus! We're running out of time. It's happening again! Stay with me, please?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...I'm trying... but I can't... stay that much longer... I don't think."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, my dear son! Then please... ask Hades what you asked of me! Why he would lie? Tell him I must know, the same as you. And you farewell. Until we meet again!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, I... discovered how come Father led you to believe that I could not survive past birth. He didn't lie to you, exactly. So he says."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Wait, slow down, Zagreus, what do you mean? He told me you would not survive your birth, yet here you are. How wasn't that a lie?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Because... he thought it was the truth. The Fates appointed him dominion over the entire Underworld. But he would never have an heir, so he was led to understand. He never expected me to be born, much less survive."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"He never expected you to survive? Then, forgive my asking, but... why did you? ''How ''did you? The Fates are not known for making mistakes when it comes to such things."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx saved my life. Or gave me life, I guess. Then raised me in your absence. The Fates are her daughters, right? Maybe she persuaded them to go easier on me. She cannot say more. In any case, apparently it took her quite a while to revive me, and... by then, you were gone."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Nyx... of course she was involved. I only managed to escape because of her. Then, she restored my stillborn son to life, and nurtured him? And, I never would have known, unless that child, fully grown and having learned the truth, defied his father, and then found me here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes. Although, we still don't know how come Father and Nyx never sent for you. Though, ''ungh'', let me ask you something, Mother, if you please. If you had found out... that I was born, and very much alive... would you have come back?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Would I have come back... to see my only child? Had I but known you lived... I would have gladly gone through hell again to see you, Zagreus. Of course I would have."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well then... what if... ''urgh''... what if Father... didn't want you... doing that?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"What if he didn't want me coming back to him? Or seeing you? Oh no, you're fading again, Zagreus. You've pushed yourself too hard! But what is it you meant, by what you said?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 04
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"So good to see you, again, Zagreus. Since last you left, I couldn't help but think the worst, about what happened after I had left... or soon before. You mentioned Nyx... you don't suppose that she and Hades... wanted me out of the way?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I just... don't think that can be. Though, let me ask you. How long did you know Father? And Nyx, for that matter? Did they seem trustworthy?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Yes. I knew them long enough to have decided yes, that they were trustworthy. As much as anyone I've ever met. But I also know never to be trusting to a fault. I have to consider the possibility I was deceived."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Especially since neither of them is being forthcoming with me even now, right? And yet, I have this feeling something else is going on, Mother. The way that Father speaks of you, the way Nyx speaks of you... I think... they care for you."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Ah, hahaha''! Well, they have a funny way of showing it, I think. Your father, so... you have to get through ''him ''each time you visit ''me''?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I do. Mother, what if... what if Father thinks that he's protecting you? Have you... considered that?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Protecting me? Why Zagreus, what do you mean by that? As you can see, I can fend for myself."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well... ''urgh''... you're from Olympus, aren't you? But... the gods, none of them seem to know... you're here... so..."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"What, how would you know something like that? Zagreus? Ah, curse the Fates, you're leaving me again..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 05 A
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Son, I have to ask you, how much do you know about your relatives upon Olympus?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think I know quite a bit by now. I've been in steady contact with Athena, Zeus, and other members of the family ever since I first left Father's House... they've been assisting me in getting here."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"No... Zagreus, what have you done? You've led them ''here''?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, no, they think... they think I'm trying to escape from Father so that I can join them on their mountaintop. At least I ''think ''that's what they think. Most of them, anyway."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"But then... does Hades know of this? That Olympus is involved?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He does. Both he and Nyx. In fact, it's Nyx who put me and Olympus into contact. I could never have broken free of the Underworld if not for their help."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"So Nyx and Hades are against each other, then. And Olympus is helping you... but they don't know I'm here, as far as you're aware?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's right. More or less. Nyx and Father seem to put up with each other. Don't seem to have much of a choice. Though, ever since I learned of you, Nyx has been helping me to find you... while Father's tried to stop me."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"That fool... what was he thinking? What ''is ''he thinking...? Do you suppose... he thinks that he's protecting me from ''them''? Oh, no..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I... ''urgh''... I think maybe he does think so, indeed... because, now having met my relatives upon Olympus, I... can definitely see that they can be a bit... vindictive about things."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Vindictiveness runs in the family, my son. Then, if Olympus is involved, that would explain a lot. I'm here, not there with them, as you can see. But, oh, it seems we'll have to speak some more, when next you return..."
|-

|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 06
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I could not stand it on Olympus, Zagreus. The blustering, the posturing... my overbearing mother... none of it. I would have left the mountain voluntarily, except..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...Except Father absconded with you, didn't he? Dragged you down with him into the Underworld. So if Olympus were to find that out... I shudder to think of the consequences."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"That fool is trying to protect me even now. It wasn't he who absconded with me, my son. And it's more complicated even than that. I was content to leave. Willing to make my life within the Underworld. With your father."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I dare not ask who ''did ''bring you to Father, then. So, essentially, you ran away from home, to live with ''him''? I mean no disrespect, but... did you realize what you were getting yourself into?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"We have a tendency to be impetuous when we are younger, Zagreus. I'd heard all about your father before we met. Admired paintings of him. It was very awkward, at first. But he had a bluntness I fancied. A sense of principle. I much preferred him to his brothers, I can tell you that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So, ''urgh''... then you secretly left Mount Olympus to be with the god of the dead in the Underworld. And Olympus never found out. What do you suppose would happen... if they did?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...I think... there would be war between Olympus and your father, Zagreus, if they found out. Especially now. After all this. And after all this time. They slew their parents once. If the Titans could be wiped from this world, so can we all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So it makes sense... if Father, he agrees with you, and thinks... that leaving you in hiding here, that it's the only way... he can prevent that war..."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I can see how your father, shrewd but also single-minded as he was, might have followed such a line of reasoning as that. Oh, Zagreus... what have I done?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 07
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Zagreus... it's wonderful to see you, but... I need to ask something of you. That you not visit me again, here in this place. Both for your safety, and for mine."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, what? Because of what would happen if the Olympians found out? So, after everything, you're taking ''Father'''s side in all of this?!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I am. Your father is no fool when it comes to matters such as this. Besides... all that has happened... it's my fault. I was selfish! And now both sides of our family threaten to be torn apart."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Your fault? So let's say you never left Olympus! Then it'd be just like you thought, until quite recently, I think. That I'd never existed! Besides, they haven't found out any of this. What makes you so sure they will, all the sudden?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Nyx may be veiling you from them as she veiled me when I fled here myself. But even her own powers aren't infallible. Each time you visit me, you are incurring risk. One small slip, and they shall find me. Discover your deception. Go home, Zagreus. Please."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Go home ''with ''me, Mother! You came here under false pretenses. I haven't fought all this way, over and over again, only to turn back now. I need you in my life! How can you just... turn me away like this?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, Zagreus... I cannot return. After all that happened between Hades and me, and everyone, I just cannot fathom the idea. Besides... the risks we're taking would be even greater if Olympus were to find me there, with him. And you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Then... ''ungh''... you're just... going to stay here? Alone, in the middle of nowhere, in this little garden... forever? After we part ways, just like that?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"My son... I know you've made hard choices and sacrifices to be here with me. And I'm forever grateful to have finally met you. But this is my home, now, yes. While your home is below. Please, if not for your sake, then for mine... do not return. I love you, Zagreus. Good-bye."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 08
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You can't do this to me, Mother. You said Father is no fool, and neither are you. There has to be a way to fix this. Not just with you and Father, but with everyone. There has to be a way!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...You have your father's stubbornness. Listen to me. You're endangering everything you care about by coming here. Don't you understand? Besides..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What? Besides what? Tell me, please."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...The truth is that I like it here, Zagreus. I have done well for myself on my own. And your father, he has his domain to look after. The feelings he once had for me... feelings we shared... they fade, with time. You'll understand, someday."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''No''! I won't be understanding anything of the sort. Father still loves you. I'm sure of it! And, he owes you an apology, damn it! I cannot make amends with you on his behalf. It's something only you can do together."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"What do you mean he still loves me, Zagreus...? How would you know?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Because... ''ungh''... I'm his blasted son, that's how I know! But ''trust me ''isn't ever good enough, I know that, too. I'll prove it to you, Mother! Just you wait and see."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"You're fading, Son... you don't need to prove anything to me. Please don't do anything rash. All of us made our choices. Now we have to live with them. Isn't it enough, to know that I am safe? That I'm content to be alone?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No... ''urgh''... it's not... it's not enough, for me, because... this blasted family... it cannot just keep hiding from its problems! Running from them! We're stuck with one another, we... we have to do everything we can... for one another!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I... oh, my dear boy..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Meeting 09
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...Of everything down in that gloomy House, I miss old Cerberus the most, I think. But, I miss other things as well. The lack of light was gentler on my skin. Not being as cold. And Nyx, and her young sons. It was all very odd, but..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother... in Father's bedchambers... mind you, there's almost nothing there, just neatly sorted rows of all his samey capes... but on his nightstand... is a portrait of ''you''. Wearing a regal crown of red laurels. A Queen. ''His ''Queen."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I was fitted for those garments when I first arrived. They... were not my customary style. So Hades has a portrait of me, still. Why would he put it back on display, now?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, no, he's never let anybody in his bedchambers! I broke in. Don't you see? He didn't put your portrait back on display. It's always been there! Ever since you left. So, Mother, why do you suppose he would do that?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Because he... because he loves me still. Is that what you want me to say?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Have you ever loved him, yourself?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"All I really wanted was to leave Olympus. I didn't exactly abscond. I doubt I had much of a choice, but I went willingly. Perhaps Zeus knew how I felt, and thought he was doing me a favor. As for Hades... I grew to love him, yes. He always gave me my space."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Won't you... ''urgh''... won't you please talk to him? Or visit Cerberus again, or Nyx? As for Olympus... surely all of you... can figure something out...?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...I just don't know, my son. Olympus is behind me. And the Underworld... I cannot imagine I would be very welcome there after all this time."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Returns Home 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, wait, what is all this?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, Zagreus, I almost missed you. Truthfully, I hoped that I could make it a surprise..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Make what a surprise?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"My arrival. I'm going. To your home. To Cerberus. Nyx. Your father."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're... ''really''?! Mother, you, you're serious?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I am. Now if you could just help me pack up my remaining things? Only a few loose odds I'm bringing, just in case. If we hurry, maybe you could join me, rather than return the customary way. Not something a mother ever wants to see."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Join you, but... wait, how are you going to get back? I... hadn't thought that far ahead."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Just so happens I know somebody who can give us a ride."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Doubtless he has pressing matters to attend to. So let's not keep him waiting any longer, Son. Come on, then!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''<Sigh> ''...I'm still alive... but, how?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"You're on the River Styx. No longer in the mortal realm, entirely."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I can't believe that this is happening."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I know. My heart is racing. Nothing like a river journey to remind oneself that there's no turning back."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Seriously. Though, even after all of this... it's like we only just met. I have so many questions for you still."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"We'll have plenty of time for them, I think! For now, best we keep quiet. Pretend we're just a couple of dead souls on their final voyage."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Boat Ride 02

|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Home Meeting 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"How has it been for you so far, Mother? Reacclimating to all this. You said before it was a struggle. Must be very strange, being back. Being in darkness all the time."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"You know, I think it's gone all right so far! Thank you for asking, Son. Everyone has been quite welcoming. The darkness is a pleasant change of pace, and while this dress can be a little difficult to move in... I quite like it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's good to hear. I have to admit I was a little worried you'd be desperate to return to your cottage by now. This place can be a little much."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I'm sure it can. And I do miss my little cottage here and there, but... I think I'm through running away. There may be times when it is necessary, of course. But no matter how far you run, it doesn't make your problems go away. You taught me that, you know."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I did? But... I tried desperately to run away, myself.... Oh."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Home Meeting 02

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Day-to-day, how can you even tell it's day around here, anyway, Mother?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''

|-

|"So, Mother, all the pomegranates around here... those are your doing?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Not a lot of fruit trees take to this environment, my son. Though, there's something about pomegranates! Maybe it's that their seeds so resemble the gemstones your father likes so much. Or that they don't need much water."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...Fruit trees, huh. I grew up around all these poms and never thought much of it. Are there many other types of fruit trees on the surface, then?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Well... I suppose there are a few. But I like pomegranates most of all."

|"On the contrary, Zagreus! It has its own unique charm. As each garden does. I was impressed it wasn't left entirely to rot after my absence."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It was totally off limits to me. Though I guess Father must have taken care to maintain it as best he could."
|-

|-

|-
|'''Persephone'''

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Do I hate him...? Mother, I don't know that I hate anybody, really. The tales of him and the Olympians rending their immortal Titan parents to bits... I can't relate to how they must have felt. But, I resented him, for sure. And... I don't know if I'll ever get over that, entirely."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I understand. I think that when Hades told you he asked no forgiveness, he understood as well, and meant it. Well, for all his failings, I'm thankful that he did not teach you how to hate. For your own sake, if not for his."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, it's been all right, I guess. I think he's set in some of his ways. But at least we have some sort of understanding now. Even if he acts like everything is still the same when I'm out there on the job."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"He says it's so you put forth your fullest effort every time. All this is a big adjustment for him as well. Not that it's any excuse for how he's treated you. Are you... all right, seeing us together?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And... what understanding is that? If you can share."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"That we're all we've got. And that we love each other. Through thick and thin."

|'''Persephone'''
|"Well, your father isn't always the conversationalist, and Nyx... she was the first chthonic god I ever met. I suppose she welcomed having another lady about the House."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone About Nyx 02
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Zagreus... how am I doing? As a mother. Tell me honestly. Nyx has had so much to share about raising you. Foods you hated or enjoyed, your natural abilities, your friendships... she knows everything! Sometimes I wonder how I can ever compete?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, I think you're doing great. And I'm sure you know it's not a competition between you and Nyx. I just get the benefit of having two great mothers rather than one. Or zero."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Thank you, my son. I know I wasn't there for most of the hard part, but... I'm here, now. Though, when I inevitably, inadvertently trample all over your feelings at some point, please tell me, all right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone About Charon 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, one thing I was wondering about was, how did you summon Charon to your surface residence? Especially without, you know, being dead."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Oh'', why... he gave me his calling card after he graciously helped get me out of here the first time. No doubt at Nyx's request, but still. Never thought I'd use it, but... I still kept it. Just in case."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Backstory 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, you'll forgive my asking, but... your mother used to call you by a different name, didn't she?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Ah'', don't remind me. Imagine if I called you ''Zaggie-poo ''from when you were born to this very moment, that's how that name felt to me. I much preferred the name my father gave to me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Your mortal father, right...? So he called you Persephone. What was he like?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"He was kind to me. And funny! Little bringer of destruction, I was to him. I liked that. He was right, I was a terror. But then he passed. I was very little still. My mother never spoke of him again."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Demeter mentioned him a bit to me. She seems... I don't know, but I don't sense that she regrets the relationship or anything. Just sad about the outcome I think."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I suppose I can see that. I thought I might end up like Father... growing old, wasting away. Then the time flew by, and I realized I was closer to Mother's side. Mortals certainly don't have it easy. But their limited days, it means... they live their lives to the fullest, I think."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, just how long has it been snowing on the surface, do you know? Because, it seems to me that Demeter... Grandmother, I should say, she... well, it's been very cold up there each time I've been."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I was afraid of that... I wanted to believe the snow about my cottage, it was native to the climate there, but... seems that Mother took my absence harder than I thought. Oh, what have I done. All those poor people."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's not your fault. You couldn't have known. And we can fix this, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Nyx told me that you helped her reconnect with her parent... after a long, long time. That was very kind of you. She never asks for anything. But we all owe her a lot, don't we?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think so. If not for her... I can't even imagine, really. Did Nyx ever speak to you of Chaos, before I was born?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Not really, no. Nyx is very private when it comes to personal matters. But she has feelings and desires same as anybody. Well, mostly, but the point is... I know this meant a lot to her."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone About Singers Reunion Quest 01
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"So Orpheus was finally able to reunite with Eurydice because of you, my son? ''Ah'', I'm so glad! Your father's arrangement with him was quite severe. Though he did ask for a lot, for a mortal soul to return to the land of the living..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Is it even possible, for Father to return a mortal back to life if he so chose? Just by letting their shade escape, or something?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, I've no idea, probably not? But we were so moved by Orpheus' plea and song, that, well... I think your father took pity on him."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, ''we ''were so moved? You were there when Orpheus came to try and rescue Eurydice?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I was. Your father knew I loved their music. Imagine my surprise to see him as our court musician, here!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"All right. We've matters with Olympus to resolve. They don't know I'm here, most of them, besides Zeus, maybe Athena. They think you're Nyx's son rather than mine, and that your goal is still to join them on their mountaintop."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What a mess. What can we do? The gods of Olympus have all been very good to me, for the most part. I don't feel great about deceiving them. They keep trying to help me escape!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"What can we do? We can make peace with them. And let them know the truth. So much of it as they would tolerate. Diplomacy is not your father's strong suit. But I am going to need you two to do exactly as I say. Do you understand?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes, Mother. So what do you intend to do, and how do I fit in?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"We're going to invite all of them to a little family gathering! Here. And you shall personally deliver them their invitations, Zagreus."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, are you serious? So, we're just going to have a bash with them, and they'll just see you after all this time, and be fine with everything?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"They certainly shall not be fine with everything. But, Hades and I, we'll be prepared to tell them what they need to hear. Don't worry, I shall do the talking."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What are you going to say?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, you know! That we met, fell in love, eloped. Had a child. A child who, once grown, sought desperately to reconnect with his extended family. To the chagrin of his grim lord father..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...Fortunately, our loving and dutiful son at last persuaded his mother and father to reveal their secretive relationship, and make an effort to rejoin their great family."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Your mother won't be happy that you left."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I'll deal with her. Perhaps I'll have to visit her and the rest of them from time to time, if that's what it shall take. But I'll be back. I've no choice! Did you know that if you eat the seeds of an Underworld pomegranate, then you cannot leave for one month out of the year, per seed?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What? No, I never knew that."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Neither do they."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"How soon is this family gathering you have in mind going to take place?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Soon after you invite them all, I hope. Now, go. And trust in me, all right? We have a lot to learn of trust, I think."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 02
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"How goes the doling out of invitations, Zagreus? Have the Olympians been amenable to the idea?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Not just amenable, Mother. Positively intrigued. I can't believe you scrambled the invitations in such a way that, only with the lot of them combined will they get all of the details!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"A bit of collaboration seemed in the spirit of things. We're a great, big family, Zagreus. Past time we started acting like one, no? Now, keep it up. And thank you for your help."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 03

|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Nyx's parent... you've been in contact, then? Look, if you feel it's the right thing to do, I trust your judgment. The spirit of this event is to bring the family together."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanks. I doubt Chaos would be able to attend, though would still appreciate the thought."
|-
! colspan="2" |Olympian Reunion Quest Complete
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's done, Mother! Father. The invitations. Personally sent to everyone with whom I've been in contact. So, what do we do now?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Excellent, Zagreus! Congratulate him, Hades! On a job well done."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"''Grr. ''Persephone, how can you be so certain your request was executed to your satisfaction?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"It's known as trust, Hades. Or faith? They're similar. Try one, sometime! It'll be good for you. As for what we do next... why, we've a great, big feast we must prepare!"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"This House is not a suitable location for such guests! Dionysus, alone, shall bring ruin to this place! Or... ''urgh''... the faith thing that you said."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Yes, good! Now then... we have a lot of work to go around, so why don't we call everyone on staff, and let them in on this, and dole out suitable responsibilities, all right?"
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"All right...."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"All right."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"All right!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...''Whew''! I'd say that went about as well as could have been expected! And the cleanup wasn't all that bad. For the most part."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"We're fortunate Uncle Zeus seemed to catch on right away, and went along with it. But, this whole elaborate tale you spun... I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And Uncle Zeus is glad things didn't turn out worse for ''him''. I get the sense he acts a bit impulsively at times, and deals with the consequences later."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"What can I tell you, Zagreus? We're family. You said it yourself to me before: We're stuck with one another. That any of us like each other in the slightest... it's a wonder and a blessing, I think."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah. I know what you mean. Thanks, Mother. Think I'll be heading out again soon. See you when I get back?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have to say, Mother, that was a clever plan. Convincing Father to finally let somebody have some fun around here."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Haha'', well! I'm glad it worked out for the best. There's just one thing that happened that I ought to tell you about, Son. No secrets between us, and all. This... is quite difficult for me to say."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's about Demeter, isn't it. You two were talking half the night. She wants you to come home with her, doesn't she? You'll always be her little one, something like that?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Indeed... something like that. You're quite perceptive, have I ever told you, Zagreus? But yes, my mother, she was quite conflicted. Didn't know whether to smite me or to hold me, maybe both. And, yes. She asked that I come home... to my responsibilities."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So... you're leaving...? No, Mother, you can't be leaving, you just got here!"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, it's not as bad as that, it's just... if we are to keep the peace down here, then, I must spend some time up there. Every so often! But, I shall always return, in no time at all. I promised Hades, and I promise you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well then... when are you going to go?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Soon, Zagreus. Perhaps by the time you're back."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't suppose... I can come with you, can I?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Tsk'', you know the surface isn't good for you! Besides, you're needed here. But, if you really want to see it for yourself, someday, who knows? Perhaps eventually we'll figure out a way."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm going to miss you, Mother."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Returns From Olympus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Welcome home, Mother! How was your trip, things go all right with you and Demeter? With... Grandmother. Still getting used to thinking of her that way."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"You know, it's funny... I think she was so overwhelmed to see me again that maybe something finally changed in her. I always thought she was utterly unyielding. She asked me if I truly came here by choice, and I put her at ease."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Ah, that's a relief. Grandmother can be rather intense, but... she's been kind to me, and very helpful, too. Do you suppose she'll ease up on the whole eternal winter thing there on the surface, now that she knows you're safe?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I asked. She told me that she would. Warmth shall return to the surface. Some of the time, at least. Likely on a rigid schedule, knowing her. And perhaps not in the vicinity of our domain. She's not the sort to forgive and simply forget."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Mother? Was it always a custom in Father's House to secretly give Nectar to those you care about? I guess it also could have been a thing on Olympus. Look, I wanted you to have this. I'm so glad I found you."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Oh, Zagreus, you're so thoughtful, truly! Your father never permitted Nectar out in the open so I'd practically forgotten its savor. Though, just a moment, I have something for you, too!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 02
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"For me? Are you quite sure? You know, this vintage must have made it all the way up from the surface, to the mountains, then to here. We've both had distant journeys, haven't we?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, I, for one, am certain this vintage here has journeyed to the right place. Please enjoy it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 03
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I must confess I do enjoy having a good bottle of Nectar, every now and then. And you appear to have a careful eye for such bottles, from what I can tell!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"My careful eye has got to be the green one, hasn't it. To having a discerning eye, Mother!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 04
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Thank you very much, my son! You know, gift-giving customs of the Underworld are just so much more straightforward than the complicated social graces of Olympus!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"If there are other ways of showing one's appreciation than with Nectar and the like, well, they must pale in comparison I'm sure!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 05
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Oh'', this is wonderful, except... I'm wracked with guilt for having nothing much to give you, in return. You never even got a mother's love from me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Please don't say that, it's just a gift, all right? Besides... can't we start now? Mother and son type things. If you would like."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I'd like that even more than this fine Nectar, Zagreus!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 06
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Somebody raised you very well indeed, my son. Nyx, I suppose. I'll never be half the mother she is. She's done it for aeons! While I'm only getting started."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"For what it's worth, I happen to think you're off to an excellent start. Nyx did teach me a lot. Achilles, too, and Father, in a way. But there is no replacing your presence. I felt that before we ever met. And now I know for sure."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Thank you, Zagreus. Let's hope you're right. I nurtured very many plants, at least, of that I can assure you! Perhaps my gardening experience provided a bit of a head start on this whole mothering thing."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 07
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mother, I know there may not be many things you miss from living on Olympus, though I wondered if perhaps Ambrosia may be one of them. And got you some, because... well, here."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...Why, this really is Ambrosia! How did you even acquire this, Zagreus? It brings back memories, for certain. And, never the bad ones, which... I think it must be why we prize this stuff so much. This is for me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It is, it is, of course! And, it's my dearest hope that, at some point long from now, when you're relaxing with a bottle of Ambrosia, dare I say perhaps with Father... that these memories will be among the ones that spring to mind."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Oh'', my son... I shall certainly not need Ambrosia to think back upon getting to know you with the greatest fondness. Thank you very much."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 08
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Here, Mother. More bottled pleasant memories for you. I know you're glad you've long since left Olympus, but... I'm glad you were there, because the experience of it must have played no small part in making you who you are."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"You know, the last bottle you gave me brought more pleasant memories than I expected. No telling just how many more of them I've tucked away. Say, would it be all right if I shared this with your father?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It is yours to do with as you please."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"''Haha'', almost sounded like a ''no ''to me!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''No''! I mean, yes, please share it with Father, if he would be willing... I imagine what few pleasant memories he has are all of you."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"Nonsense, there's also Cerberus! Present company excluded. Come on, Son. Your father has a lot of work to do, but I'm absolutely certain that he has fond memories of you. Though, I know that isn't reassuring, coming from me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Everything is somehow reassuring, coming from you, Mother."
|-
! colspan="2" |Persephone Gift 09
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I thought about it more, Mother, and I would like very much if you and Father were to share this. Though, maybe don't let on where you got it, just in case?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"This is splendid, Zagreus, but please! If there's one thing I've learned since we met, it's that the trust we share is at the very foundation of our relationships. Why shouldn't he know who this is from? Besides, I think he could figure it out."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, when it came to the Olympians, you said yourself that there was only so much truth that they could tolerate. Are you sure Father would be tolerant knowing I got this for the both of you?"
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"I'm sure enough! And if he isn't, I suppose it's more for me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Haha'', well! Just as long as someone puts it to good use."
|-
|'''Persephone'''
|"...You know I always wanted to be a mother, Zagreus? But after you were born... I was certain I had lost my chance. Then one fine morning you just walked into my life. And here we are. I still cannot entirely believe it. What I mean is... I love you, Son. I'm doing my best."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I know. I love you, too, Mother."
