PatroclusFirstMeeting|Patroclus First Meeting|Patroclus|...Go on, stranger. Plenty more shades looking to fight with you out there.
PatroclusFirstMeeting|Patroclus First Meeting|Zagreus|I'm just passing through. You seem less warlike than the rest. May I ask your name, sir? I'm Zagreus.
PatroclusFirstMeeting|Patroclus First Meeting|Patroclus|Names are there to be forgotten, stranger. You shouldn't be here. May the Fates favor your journey. But just in case they don't, here. Why don't you take this?
PatroclusMeeting02|Patroclus Meeting 02|Zagreus|Is something wrong, there, sir? I mean, shouldn't you be up and about, competing for eternal pride and glory and all that?
PatroclusMeeting02|Patroclus Meeting 02|Patroclus|What's the use? Let's say we fought, if anybody asks. Now, go. I've no quarrel with you, besides. I'll just remain here, comfortably at rest, for some untold millennia, I guess. Have a nice... whatever time it is.
PatroclusMeeting03|Patroclus Meeting 03|Patroclus|Still toiling around within Elysium, I see. Battling my brethren, in the name of glory, is that it?
PatroclusMeeting03|Patroclus Meeting 03|Zagreus|I'm heading for the surface. Though your brethren are slowing me down. Whether for glory or at my father's behest.
PatroclusMeeting03|Patroclus Meeting 03|Patroclus|Your father...? *Ah*, that's right, but you're the Prince, aren't you. You must see plainly, then, what your birthright amounts to: You're no better off than any of us here. Now, go.
PatroclusMeeting04|Patroclus Meeting 04|Patroclus|You again. I told you to stay clear of me. Your father's quite the big shot around here, but that means nothing to me, understand? Go, and tell him he can cast me in the pits of Tartarus, for all I care. It'd be a welcome change of pace from being put to pasture here.
PatroclusMeeting05|Patroclus Meeting 05|Patroclus|I was unkind last time, stranger. Forgive my indiscretions there. Or don't. But I wished to apologize.
PatroclusMeeting05|Patroclus Meeting 05|Zagreus|Think nothing of it, sir. Though if there's something I could do to help, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
PatroclusMeeting05|Patroclus Meeting 05|Patroclus|You have no power to release me from this coil, I'm afraid. So just go on about your business, and leave me to mine.
PatroclusMeeting06|Patroclus Meeting 06|Patroclus|Stranger, I am warning you: If you keep showing up like this, I'm going to have to find a new nickname for you.
PatroclusMeeting06|Patroclus Meeting 06|Zagreus|No need to go out of your way, there, sir. We're just acquaintances. I don't know anything about you, either.
PatroclusMeeting06|Patroclus Meeting 06|Patroclus|And you are better off. This place is for the greatest of the Greeks. Do I seem like the sort to fit in, here? Go on and chat with Theseus, or someone of that sort.
PatroclusMeeting06B|Patroclus Meeting 06 B|Patroclus|Stranger, I am warning you: If you keep showing up like this, I'm going to have to find a new nickname for you.
PatroclusMeeting06B|Patroclus Meeting 06 B|Zagreus|No need to go out of your way, there, sir. I rather feel like a stranger around here. I have no plans to extend my stay.
PatroclusMeeting06B|Patroclus Meeting 06 B|Patroclus|And you are better off. This place is for the greatest of the Greeks. Do I seem like the sort to fit in, here? Go on and chat with Theseus, or someone of that sort.
PatroclusMeeting07|Patroclus Meeting 07|Patroclus|Tell me, stranger, if it pleases you. How is it you keep running into me...? I thought this the remotest corner of Elysium.
PatroclusMeeting07|Patroclus Meeting 07|Zagreus|The ever-shifting chambers of the Underworld leave quite a bit to chance. I took our meetings merely for coincidence.
PatroclusMeeting07|Patroclus Meeting 07|Patroclus|When chance is too far-fetched to be believed, then it's the Fates at play. Or something else. I don't know whether to believe you, but I know that I want you to leave me, now.
PatroclusMeeting07B|Patroclus Meeting 07 B|Patroclus|Tell me, stranger, if it pleases you. How is it you keep running into me...? I thought this the remotest corner of Elysium.
PatroclusMeeting07B|Patroclus Meeting 07 B|Zagreus|The ever-shifting chambers of the Underworld leave quite a bit to chance. I took our meetings merely for coincidence.
PatroclusMeeting07B|Patroclus Meeting 07 B|Patroclus|When chance is too far-fetched to be believed, then it's the Fates at play. Or something else.
PatroclusMeeting08|Patroclus Meeting 08|Patroclus|What is it this time, stranger? You're quite effective at locating me, but not so good at leaving me in peace.
PatroclusMeeting08|Patroclus Meeting 08|Zagreus|Just on one of my little jaunts through paradise is all, sir. Happened to be on the way toward my destination.
PatroclusMeeting08|Patroclus Meeting 08|Patroclus|You think this place a paradise? At least down in the depths, there are so many other souls with whom to share one's misery. No offense... I know that you're just passing through.
PatroclusMeeting09|Patroclus Meeting 09|Patroclus|So, stranger. How goes willful disobedience of late? Would that I, too, had it within me to defy the gods.
PatroclusMeeting09|Patroclus Meeting 09|Zagreus|Oh, you know, it's going. That I've been able to make it this far means I am getting somewhere, I suppose. No thanks to all your brethren in Elysium.
PatroclusMeeting09|Patroclus Meeting 09|Patroclus|No use trying to reason with my brethren here. Many of the shades whom you've encountered, why, I watched them throw away their lives when they were men. Yet still they seek to prove to one another and themselves that they are great warriors.
PatroclusMeeting10|Patroclus Meeting 10|Zagreus|Say, isn't that the Lethe right nearby? You've been through so much, don't you ever... you could just drink deeply of the River of Forgetfulness, and be done with, no?
PatroclusMeeting10|Patroclus Meeting 10|Patroclus|It has been rather tempting, yes. And I have taken sips, from time to time. But I've some memories I'm not quite ready to give up on, yet.
PatroclusMeeting11|Patroclus Meeting 11|Zagreus|You ever want to travel past this glade, sir? Elysium in all its splendors... there's a lot to see. Sure you're all right?
PatroclusMeeting11|Patroclus Meeting 11|Patroclus|I'm sure enough, stranger. I traveled far and wide whilst I drew breath. That got me rid of any wanderlust. This little corner suits me well, I think. I have the statue there, the river... it's quite nice.
PatroclusAboutBracer01A|Patroclus About Bracer 01 A|Patroclus|What is that on your wrist, there, stranger? Let me see, is that... a bracer of the myrmidons. But, then...
PatroclusAboutBracer01A|Patroclus About Bracer 01 A|Zagreus|Wait, this? How did you know? It's just a keepsake from a friend.
PatroclusAboutBracer01A|Patroclus About Bracer 01 A|Patroclus|A keepsake? From a friend...? You tell your friend, then, that Patroclus waits for him, and that he holds no grudge, should he return to him.
PatroclusAboutBracer01B|Patroclus About Bracer 01 B|Patroclus|What is that on your wrist, there, stranger? Let me see, is that... a bracer of the myrmidons. But, then...
PatroclusAboutBracer01B|Patroclus About Bracer 01 B|Zagreus|You recognize it, then. Of course. It's from Achilles, sir. He gifted it to me. He trained me.
PatroclusAboutBracer01B|Patroclus About Bracer 01 B|Patroclus|I see... a gift. Well, then, you let Achilles know Patroclus waits for him, and holds no grudge, should he return to him.
PatroclusAboutBracer01E|Patroclus About Bracer 01 E|Patroclus|What is that on your wrist, there, stranger? Let me see, is that... a bracer of the myrmidons. Achilles...
PatroclusAboutBracer01E|Patroclus About Bracer 01 E|Zagreus|This is his bracer, yes. You recognize it, then. Were you a myrmidon, yourself? I heard they were unstoppable.
PatroclusAboutBracer01E|Patroclus About Bracer 01 E|Patroclus|Well, now... if we were so unstoppable, we'd not be here, would we? May that bracer protect you more than its like protected our phalanxes.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect01|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 01|Patroclus|Must say that's an impressive spear you've got, there, stranger. Rather like the one Achilles held. He gave it to you, then? Followed him beyond the grave, only to be handed off.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect01|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 01|Zagreus|It's... a bit more complicated than that, sir, though yes. This is the very same as he once wielded. I am honored to carry it now.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect01|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 01|Patroclus|I'll bet. Perhaps you'll even come to surpass the body count Achilles piled up with it back in his day, seeing as you seem to have limitless opportunity to use it.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect02|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 02|Patroclus|You know, stranger, there was a time Achilles would have killed someone for taking up his spear. But there you are, like you own it.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect02|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 02|Zagreus|I don't think anybody owns this spear, sir. I'm hanging onto it for the time being. Though I don't think I'll be the last to do so.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect02|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 02|Patroclus|Oh, there's no need to get all philosophical about it. It's a killing weapon. Nothing more.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|You mentioned something of your parentage, stranger. I have a question on that subject, if you please.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Zagreus|I please, sir. What's your question? Ask away.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|Your father must have records of the dead. So I was wondering if you might do for me a favor, and look up the whereabouts of someone I once knew.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Zagreus|You've done a lot for me. The least I can do is ask around. Who is it that you're looking for?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|I seek one called Achilles. Was rather famous once among the living, but among the dead, who knows. I thought he would be here, but he is not.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Zagreus|...Achilles... I've heard the name before. And, *erm*, can I ask why you wish to know of him? In case it happens to come up.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|It's just... I simply miss him, stranger. That is all.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Patroclus|Something the matter, there, stranger? Or have you come to torment me some more with idle chat?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Zagreus|You know Achilles, don't you, sir. You're Patroclus. Achilles... serves us at my home. He trained me. He sends you his regards and love. He says to tell you he is thinking of you always.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Patroclus|...That name. So then you've seen him, have you. In your father's house. And want me to believe he said all that? *Tsk*. You'll forgive me if I am a little skeptical. In life, I left Achilles. And in death, he left me. We're even. And we've nothing left to say to one another, now.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Zagreus|But, that can't possibly be true. There must be some misunderstanding here. You haven't spoken since you died?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Patroclus|We haven't, no. And I don't think we shall. But, you can humor him for me, I guess. Tell him I'm doing perfectly all right, won't you?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Patroclus|Something the matter, there, stranger? Or have you come to torment me some more with idle chat?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Zagreus|Patroclus. I know who you are, sir. And, you know Achilles. He serves us at my home. He trained me. He sends you his regards and love. He says to tell you he is thinking of you always.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Patroclus|...*Ah*. So then you've seen him, have you. In your father's house. And want me to believe he said all that? *Tsk*. You'll forgive me if I am a little skeptical. In life, I left Achilles. And in death, he left me. We're even. And we've nothing left to say to one another, now.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Zagreus|But, that can't possibly be true. There must be some misunderstanding here. You haven't spoken since you died?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Patroclus|We haven't, no. And I don't think we shall. But, you can humor him for me, I guess. Tell him I'm doing perfectly all right, won't you?
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Patroclus|So, how's Achilles doing lately, stranger? I figured you could tell me since you've all this access to him, and I don't.
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Zagreus|He's forced to do my father's bidding. And sworn to secrecy, apparently. I don't pretend to fully understand. But, all in all, I think he's doing well. I hope... you'll see him for yourself.
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Patroclus|You don't fully understand, but hope. I see. Well, if you do get to the bottom of this little mystery at some point, you'll indulge me, won't you?
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Zagreus|I'll... see what I can do about it, sir.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Patroclus|He's never going to return to me, is he. He's in your father's service now. He's never getting out. Neither are you.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Zagreus|No. That's not acceptable to me. None of it.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Patroclus|How bold. So what do you intend to do? You're leaving, anyway.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Zagreus|I'll figure something out. But you do something for me, in the mean time: Don't give in to what you're feeling now, all right? Achilles loves you still, like you don't know.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Patroclus|Does he? I'm past the point of making promises, but... I pray the Fates help you in your endeavors, there.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Patroclus|He's never going to return to me, is he. He's in your father's service now. He's never getting out. Neither are you.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Zagreus|No. That's not acceptable to me. None of it.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Patroclus|How bold. So what do you intend to do? You're leaving, anyway.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Zagreus|I'll figure something out. But you do something for me, in the meantime: Don't give in to what you're feeling now, all right? Achilles loves you still, like you don't know.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Patroclus|I'm past the point of making promises, but... thank you for your words. I love him still, in turn. I pray the Fates help you in your endeavors, there.
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Patroclus|He's just as obstinate as ever, isn't he? Always refused to budge. He ever tell you of the war in which we fought? *I *fought, I should say. He could have ended it. But he refused to take up arms.
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Zagreus|Achilles hasn't been particularly forthcoming about his mortal days, no. So he wouldn't fight? I've heard that mortals sometimes frown on that, but... why should he have fought if he didn't believe in the cause?
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Patroclus|He *shared *our cause! So what if it was not completely his? If not for his stubbornness, I... well... I would have come here just a bit later, I think.
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Zagreus|He blames himself for what happened to you, you know. I figured he failed to defend you or something, not that... he didn't fight at all. Although, he said something about how, once you died, he shortly followed in a rage...
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Patroclus|I wouldn't know a thing about that, stranger, for you see... I was already dead. Getting my place here in the afterlife all sorted out. Took quite some time, getting accustomed to all this.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Patroclus|A question, if you don't mind, stranger? Because, I've had one nagging at me since we last discussed the subject. What, exactly, happened to Achilles, can you say? After I died, that is. I've heard the rumors, but... I don't trust any of this boastful lot.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Zagreus|Well, from what I gathered, sir... after you fell, he was overcome with grief. And anger. He joined the war, just like you urged. And, single-handedly, he almost ended it.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Patroclus|So then, he threw away his life. Soon enough after I lost mine. Yet, despite vanquishing an army on his own, he wound up in the lowest pits of Tartarus? Instead of here, among the great?
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Zagreus|You should know, sir. You were buried together. Your ashes, that is. It was his final request. As for how he came to be at my father's house, that's something I think he can best explain. And I will do everything I can to make sure that he has the opportunity.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Patroclus|...Our ashes, you say. Together? *Tsk. *The fool. We could have lived! Not been reduced to meal for the worms. But... I appreciate the information, stranger. Now... please, go.
PatroclusAboutAchilles06|Patroclus About Achilles 06|Patroclus|...Forgive me, stranger. For, in retrospect, I was too terse after you told me what became of my Achilles. Tales of his climactic battle, I had heard. The stuff about... his ashes, and my own... that was all new.
PatroclusAboutAchilles06|Patroclus About Achilles 06|Zagreus|No need to even ask forgiveness, sir. Achilles is one of my closest friends, but.. he doesn't care to talk about himself. About those times. It must be very painful. For the both of you.
PatroclusAboutAchilles06|Patroclus About Achilles 06|Patroclus|Oh, we've all seen our share of pain, by now. But... knowing that he cared for me, in the end... *after *the end... it dulls the feeling of it, for a bit. As do these conversations, I guess.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|I've meant to ask you something, stranger. Would you mind doing me a favor, please? If it happens to come up along your path. Suppose I ought to tell it to you first, prior to asking a response.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|No, of course, sir, what is it? What's on your mind?
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|If I know my Achilles, then he's being rather guarded, when it comes to this predicament we're in. How can somebody be so brash yet hate to take unnecessary risks? Just let him know I said to risk it all.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Risk it all? Risk *what *all? He wants what's best for you. He wouldn't want anything to happen.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|It's already long since happened. I daresay that, right now, provided what you've said is true, then... it appears we've more to gain than lose. Isn't fear for the weak?
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Patroclus With Achilles 01|Achilles|I thought we might run into you, but... how strange to see you face-to-face out here, lad. To see this place myself. I still can't quite believe any of this...
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Patroclus With Achilles 01|Patroclus|He really can't. Though I keep telling him, it's true. Nothing's accomplished without risk, isn't that so? But, we of course have you to thank, stranger. Our troubles needn't have been your concern.
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Patroclus With Achilles 01|Zagreus|Nonsense, sir. You're my friend. And Achilles... I don't know where I would even be, if not for you.
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Patroclus With Achilles 01|Patroclus|Well, no need to get emotional, is there? We myrmidons, we're not the sentimental type. Achilles is simply on break, is all. From a demanding job. You've a demanding job as well, so here! My customary gift.
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Patroclus With Achilles 02|Patroclus|Well if it isn't the ward of Achilles, come to visit us. I don't know how I can ever repay you, stranger. I'm quite sure that it isn't possible.
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Patroclus With Achilles 02|Achilles|I reached more or less the same conclusion, Pat.
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Patroclus With Achilles 02|Zagreus|How about you just keep offering me those premium goods you have no interest in when I pass through, and we can call it even, sir?
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Patroclus With Achilles 02|Patroclus|That I had plans to do, regardless, though... if you should think of something else at any point, please do let either of us know.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Patroclus With Achilles 03|Patroclus|Good, there you are, stranger. Settle something for us quickly, hm? Would Achilles not make for the perfect Champion of Elysium? For I think almost anybody would be better than the current one.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Patroclus With Achilles 03|Achilles|I think I'd rather maintain watch over a nearly empty hall than battle all the shades around here, Pat.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Patroclus With Achilles 03|Zagreus|I, too, would vastly prefer having to contend with Theseus rather than yourself, Achilles. Although, that's not to say I disagree that almost anybody would be better in the role than him.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Patroclus With Achilles 03|Patroclus|It seems, then, I am overruled. But I know Champion material when I see it, and I see it now.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|Achilles is returned to work for now... but, waiting for him, knowing he'll return... rather than waiting for the sake of it, for nothing... such a different feeling, stranger. I'd forgotten it entirely, I think.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|I'm happy for the both of you. So, is everything all right, then? The circumstances under which you were separated in life... it's unimaginable, really. How does one move on from a thing like that?
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|Anger fades, I guess, stranger. Even the famous anger of Achilles. Anger burns hot, then burns out. What's left is a dull ache, but... underneath it, there was something else. It felt as though... well, I was still alive. That feeling... it's worth holding onto.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Patroclus|It's good to see you again, stranger. You don't mind if I keep calling you that, no? Couldn't find a better nickname for you, after all. Besides... I don't want to cause you any trouble.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|Don't mind at all, Patroclus, sir. Coming from you I consider it a term of endearment.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Patroclus|You have my thanks for that...
PatroclusPostEnding01|Patroclus Post Ending 01|Patroclus|Achilles tells me that you're here to stay, at least for now, stranger. A welcome bit of news. Assuming, of course, that it's for the best, for you?
PatroclusPostEnding01|Patroclus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|I think so, sir. I'll still be passing through, and visiting the surface every opportunity I get. But it seems my place really is here. Besides, it means getting to see you every now and then, like this.
PatroclusPostEnding01|Patroclus Post Ending 01|Patroclus|That sounds agreeable to me. Then, you take care.
PatroclusPostEpilogue01|Patroclus Post Epilogue 01|Patroclus|There's been considerable talk of late about the Queen Persephone, stranger. Your mother, it would seem? Sounds to me your tale's almost as complicated as my own.
PatroclusPostEpilogue01|Patroclus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|It's a long story, at this point, indeed. But yes. The Queen... my mother... she's returned. And, it's been really good, having her back.
PatroclusPostEpilogue01|Patroclus Post Epilogue 01|Patroclus|I can only begin to imagine. May she help govern all of this with wisdom and with grace.
PatroclusAboutKeepsake01|Patroclus About Keepsake 01|Zagreus|This spearpoint that you gave me, sir. It's been quite useful, though I have to ask you... is there any particular significance to it? Most spearpoints aren't imbued with power such as this.
PatroclusAboutKeepsake01|Patroclus About Keepsake 01|Patroclus|Oh, that. Just something I'd been meaning to get rid of, but... it can be difficult, discarding trifles from the past. Knowing it's provided you some benefit is welcome news.
PatroclusAboutKeepsake02|Patroclus About Keepsake 02|Zagreus|Did you once wield a spear yourself, sir? In your fighting days?
PatroclusAboutKeepsake02|Patroclus About Keepsake 02|Patroclus|Did I once wield a spear? You could say that I did. I had my moments with it, anyway. Even once slew a demigod! He's probably somewhere about. Quite awkward, running into those you killed. But in Elysium it's all taken in stride.
PatroclusAboutWar01|Patroclus About War 01|Zagreus|Whatever happened with that war you mentioned, sir? If you don't mind my asking.
PatroclusAboutWar01|Patroclus About War 01|Patroclus|Well, truth be told, here, stranger... I do mind. You speak as one who's not experienced a war. Those of us who survived... or, you know what I mean... we do bear some responsibility to history. But, all the same, it's not a time and place to which I would return. I trust you'll understand.
PatroclusAboutYoungAchilles01|Patroclus About Young Achilles 01|Zagreus|I always wondered, sir. What was Achilles like...? During his youth, I mean. If you can say.
PatroclusAboutYoungAchilles01|Patroclus About Young Achilles 01|Patroclus|*Hah*. How to describe what somebody was like? Everyone who saw him on the battlefield agreed he was magnificent, stranger. His allies and his enemies alike. But, there was more to him, I think. A certain outlook. A sense of justice. I knew him before he was a warrior. Only reason I suppose I liked him.
PatroclusAboutTheseus01|Patroclus About Theseus 01|Patroclus|I heard you've vanquished Theseus however many times of late. Or... someone matching your description has, stranger. Almost had to laugh when I heard that. Though, I suspect he hasn't learnt a thing.
PatroclusAboutTheseus01|Patroclus About Theseus 01|Zagreus|What, you know him? Though, yes, he does seem rather set in his ways. Convinced himself that I'm some sort of demon from the lowest depths. Which... well, it's partly true, I guess.
PatroclusAboutTheseus01|Patroclus About Theseus 01|Patroclus|You're quite notorious, around these parts. The tales of your father's monstrous son, kept under lock and key within his House. Fear and ignorance make for great stories, no?
PatroclusAboutTheseus02|Patroclus About Theseus 02|Patroclus|Couldn't help but hear the rattling of battle chariots of late. Raucous laughter and the like. You've really riled up the locals this time, stranger.
PatroclusAboutTheseus02|Patroclus About Theseus 02|Zagreus|Must be Theseus and his fancy Macedonian. So he's been joyriding about in that thing? Showing it off?
PatroclusAboutTheseus02|Patroclus About Theseus 02|Patroclus|Your arrivals are becoming a bit of an event, I'd say. And, yes, the Champion and his bull friend are likely at the center of it. You'll have to forgive me that I've no intent on attending your contests, but... well, here.
PatroclusAboutTheseus03|Patroclus About Theseus 03|Zagreus|You know, for such a loudmouth obnoxious braggart, Theseus does seem to have formed a strong kinship with the Bull of Minos, hasn't he. Are they truly as inseparable as they seem? I feel bad for the Bull.
PatroclusAboutTheseus03|Patroclus About Theseus 03|Patroclus|Sometimes it's our differences that make us drawn to one another, no? And, at other times, there's no accounting for taste. I often don't know which is which, and they can have each other, far as I'm concerned.
PatroclusAboutMinotaur01|Patroclus About Minotaur 01|Patroclus|Even the Bull of Minos couldn't stop you, huh. That's one whose way I would stay out of if I could, but... well, you'd not be here if you couldn't handle yourself, I guess.
PatroclusAboutMinotaur01|Patroclus About Minotaur 01|Zagreus|You heard I battled with Asterius, here, sir? I thought you kept more to your own devices. Weren't much for conversation with the other shades.
PatroclusAboutMinotaur01|Patroclus About Minotaur 01|Patroclus|Oh, you're correct in that assessment, stranger. But, as you've seen, I've no ability to stop others from coming and going as they please. So I do tend to hear a thing or two from passersby.
PatroclusAboutHeroes01|Patroclus About Heroes 01|Zagreus|You must have met so many great heroes in your day, having fought alongside Achilles... do you still keep in touch with any of them, here?
PatroclusAboutHeroes01|Patroclus About Heroes 01|Patroclus|Great heroes... haven't you seen, by now, what they are like, stranger? Not all entirely what they're cracked up to be. But, there were good ones, yes. Suppose they're mostly keeping to themselves. Like I am here. Perhaps we'll run into each other, down the line.
PatroclusAboutGods01|Patroclus About Gods 01|Patroclus|Never quite considered... you're related to the gods upon Olympus, aren't you, stranger...? I should be far more careful around you.
PatroclusAboutGods01|Patroclus About Gods 01|Zagreus|What do you mean by that, sir? Though, yes, my father being who he is, it means I have a lot of uncles, cousins, and the like, up on the surface, there.
PatroclusAboutGods01|Patroclus About Gods 01|Patroclus|Well... you would be wise to watch yourself, with some of them, I think. Don't get on anyone's bad side, if you can help it. Which, when I yet lived, none of us could.
PatroclusAboutLove01_A|Patroclus About Love 01 A|Patroclus|You ever been in love with someone, stranger? Might be a mortals-only thing, for all I know. You gods have strange relationships, I hear.
PatroclusAboutLove01_A|Patroclus About Love 01 A|Zagreus|I have been, sir. Or, I should say, I am.
PatroclusAboutLove01_A|Patroclus About Love 01 A|Patroclus|Ah, that's good. Cling to the feeling, then. And if you lose it... reach for it. Search for it, no matter what, all right? Because, without it... well, there isn't much of a comparison, I think.
PatroclusAboutLove01_B|Patroclus About Love 01 B|Patroclus|You ever been in love with someone, stranger? Might be a mortals-only thing, for all I know. You gods have strange relationships, I hear.
PatroclusAboutLove01_B|Patroclus About Love 01 B|Zagreus|Not sure that I have been, sir. I understand it's one of those things where, you'll know it when it happens.
PatroclusAboutLove01_B|Patroclus About Love 01 B|Patroclus|Perhaps you shall, someday or night down here. The feeling comes with pain, and plenty of it, but... the pain is worth it, in my limited experience. And once you find that feeling, cling to it. As tightly as you can. If you don't mind my saying.
PatroclusAboutTrinkets01|Patroclus About Trinkets 01|Patroclus|Well, what's it going to be this time, stranger? The HydraLite? Maybe the Kiss of Styx?
PatroclusAboutTrinkets01|Patroclus About Trinkets 01|Zagreus|You sure you don't need any of this stuff, sir? I really appreciate it, but... I don't want to take it for granted.
PatroclusAboutTrinkets01|Patroclus About Trinkets 01|Patroclus|Oh, come, this is Elysium. Taking such things for granted is the point. We gloried shades receive our stipend of the finest goods, so we can battle till we've had our fill. But I've already had my fill, I think.
PatroclusAboutFishing01|Patroclus About Fishing 01|Patroclus|You've ample time for fishing, have you, stranger? And here I thought you'd more important business to attend to, though it's not for me to judge, I guess.
PatroclusAboutFishing01|Patroclus About Fishing 01|Zagreus|I'll have you know some of us take matters of fishing very seriously, sir! Besides... helps take my mind off having to fight your Elysian brethren nonstop.
PatroclusAboutFishing01|Patroclus About Fishing 01|Patroclus|Oh I'd not take your mind off this fight if it's one that you hope to win, stranger. I once took my mind off a fight, and, well... I wound up here.
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Zagreus|I have to tell you, sir, it was a real sight to see you fighting alongside Achilles. You two were amazing!
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Patroclus|Oh, I'm a little rusty. But he's not. Still very much in tiptop shape, except more able to control his temper, I should think.
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Zagreus|Don't sell yourself so short! Though, I thought you laid down your spear forever. Why choose to fight again?
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Patroclus|Achilles swayed me into realizing some activity may be quite good for me. And besides... if we can aid you in a pinch, that's worth my while.
PatroclusLowHealth01|Patroclus Low Health 01|Patroclus|You look positively beaten, there, stranger. Let's see if we can't get you on your feet. For I can do the listless sitting for the both of us.
PatroclusLowHealth02|Patroclus Low Health 02|Patroclus|Oh, you look terrible, if I may say, stranger. Perhaps one of these trinkets can be of some small help.
PatroclusChat01|Patroclus Chat 01|Patroclus|You again? Then, here. Fates know I'll not be needing this.
PatroclusChat02|Patroclus Chat 02|Patroclus|Move right along, stranger. Let's skip the pleasantries.
PatroclusChat03|Patroclus Chat 03|Patroclus|And here I thought you must have given up already.
PatroclusChat04|Patroclus Chat 04|Patroclus|Enjoying the splendors of Elysium, yet, stranger?
PatroclusChat05|Patroclus Chat 05|Patroclus|Don't let me interrupt your stay in paradise, stranger.
PatroclusChat06|Patroclus Chat 06|Patroclus|Returned to take more of these trinkets off my hands, have you?
PatroclusChat07|Patroclus Chat 07|Patroclus|Oh, it's only you again, stranger. It's only me, as well.
PatroclusChat08|Patroclus Chat 08|Patroclus|Take one of these and then just leave me be, stranger.
PatroclusChat09|Patroclus Chat 09|Patroclus|I'd like to be alone again, stranger, so you go on ahead.
PatroclusChat10|Patroclus Chat 10|Patroclus|No need to linger with me, stranger. Go.
PatroclusChat11|Patroclus Chat 11|Patroclus|Why your path keeps on crossing mine, I've not the slightest clue.
PatroclusChat12|Patroclus Chat 12|Patroclus|Some other time, stranger. Right now I'm preoccupied with sitting here.
PatroclusChat13|Patroclus Chat 13|Patroclus|There's nothing you can do to help me, stranger.
PatroclusChat14|Patroclus Chat 14|Patroclus|Can't you see I'm busy whiling away for all eternity?
PatroclusChat15|Patroclus Chat 15|Patroclus|A fine whatever time it is to you, stranger.
PatroclusChat16|Patroclus Chat 16|Patroclus|You haven't lost your will just yet, I see.
PatroclusChat17|Patroclus Chat 17|Patroclus|Expecting I'll still be right here next time, stranger.
PatroclusChat18|Patroclus Chat 18|Patroclus|Just go, already, towards your next death or whatever else awaits.
PatroclusChat19|Patroclus Chat 19|Patroclus|You're back again, I see. And just in time to take one of these blasted things from me.
PatroclusChat19|Patroclus Chat 19|Patroclus|I'll wait for him, however long it takes. You tell him that.
PatroclusChat20|Patroclus Chat 20|Patroclus|I pray Achilles is surviving well. And same for you.
PatroclusChat21|Patroclus Chat 21|Patroclus|It's good of you to visit, though there's little I can offer in return.
PatroclusChat22|Patroclus Chat 22|Patroclus|Please make yourself at home here in this corner of eternal paradise.
PatroclusChat23|Patroclus Chat 23|Patroclus|Do let Achilles know I'm doing well, and I'll be ever patient, here.
PatroclusChat24|Patroclus Chat 24|Patroclus|I doubt there's much that I can do for you.
PatroclusChat25|Patroclus Chat 25|Patroclus|You're interfering with my quiet time, you know.
PatroclusChat26|Patroclus Chat 26|Patroclus|Yes, what is it, this time?
PatroclusChat27|Patroclus Chat 27|Patroclus|Here's what I have that I can spare right now.
PatroclusChat27|Patroclus Chat 27|Patroclus|Might I somehow assist you, then?
PatroclusChat28|Patroclus Chat 28|Patroclus|Oh good, somebody's here to save me from myself.
PatroclusChat29|Patroclus Chat 29|Patroclus|How can I be of use to you, stranger?
PatroclusChat30|Patroclus Chat 30|Patroclus|I've no shortage of time to spare, I guess.
PatroclusChat31|Patroclus Chat 31|Patroclus|Ah, just a stranger passing through, I see.
PatroclusChat32|Patroclus Chat 32|Patroclus|Not in the mood for conversation now, stranger.
PatroclusChat33|Patroclus Chat 33|Patroclus|Go on about your business, there, stranger.
PatroclusChat34|Patroclus Chat 34|Patroclus|Good fortune getting out of here, stranger.
PatroclusChat35|Patroclus Chat 35|Patroclus|Here's something for the journey still to come.
PatroclusChat36|Patroclus Chat 36|Patroclus|Prepared to face the champion, soon, stranger?
PatroclusChat37|Patroclus Chat 37|Patroclus|May this aid you against the champion, out there.
PatroclusChat38|Patroclus Chat 38|Patroclus|Be careful with my brethren out there, stranger.
PatroclusChat39|Patroclus Chat 39|Patroclus|Battle with glory and all that, all right, stranger?
PatroclusChat40|Patroclus Chat 40|Patroclus|I would prefer to be alone for now, stranger.
PatroclusChat41|Patroclus Chat 41|Patroclus|Just don't go starting any wars you don't intend to finish, stranger.
PatroclusStandoffish01|Patroclus Standoffish 01|Patroclus|Leave me be to my eternal paradise, damn you.
PatroclusStandoffish02|Patroclus Standoffish 02|Patroclus|I shall not take up arms again, stranger, not even against you.
PatroclusStandoffish03|Patroclus Standoffish 03|Patroclus|Begone from here, we've nothing to discuss.
PatroclusStandoffish04|Patroclus Standoffish 04|Patroclus|Go haunt some other corner of this realm; this one is mine.
PatroclusStandoffish05|Patroclus Standoffish 05|Patroclus|I thought I told you to leave me alone?
PatroclusStandoffish06|Patroclus Standoffish 06|Patroclus|Do I look like I want to talk to you?
PatroclusStandoffish07|Patroclus Standoffish 07|Patroclus|What is it that you want from me this time?
PatroclusStandoffish08|Patroclus Standoffish 08|Patroclus|What would it take for you to leave me be?
PatroclusStandoffish10|Patroclus Standoffish 10|Patroclus|What would you have me do?
PatroclusReunionChat01|Patroclus Reunion Chat 01|Patroclus|It's good to see you once again, stranger. Now, here.
PatroclusReunionChat02|Patroclus Reunion Chat 02|Patroclus|We're faring well enough, and may you fare the same.
PatroclusReunionChat03|Patroclus Reunion Chat 03|Patroclus|You've come to be a welcome sight, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat04|Patroclus Reunion Chat 04|Patroclus|May you prevail in your battles still to come, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat05A|Patroclus Reunion Chat 05 A|Patroclus|We were just wondering when you'd arrive, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat05|Patroclus Reunion Chat 05|Patroclus|Achilles and I were just passing the time I guess.
PatroclusReunionChat06|Patroclus Reunion Chat 06|Patroclus|I and Achilles here still have a lot of catching up to do.
PatroclusReunionChat07|Patroclus Reunion Chat 07|Patroclus|Fight like my friend here used to fight, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat08|Patroclus Reunion Chat 08|Patroclus|May all your fears leave you behind once you walk past that door.
PatroclusReunionChat09|Patroclus Reunion Chat 09|Patroclus|You'll show that champion of ours, won't you, stranger?
PatroclusReunionChat10|Patroclus Reunion Chat 10|Patroclus|I'm pleased to be of any help at all.
PatroclusReunionChat11|Patroclus Reunion Chat 11|Patroclus|First a visit from Achilles, and now you.
PatroclusReunionChat12|Patroclus Reunion Chat 12|Patroclus|Please stay as long as you would like here in our little glade.
PatroclusReunionChat13|Patroclus Reunion Chat 13|Patroclus|Take caution with our battle-loving brethren around here.
PatroclusReunionChat14|Patroclus Reunion Chat 14|Patroclus|If you can make yourself at home in such a place, please do, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat15A|Patroclus Reunion Chat 15 A|Patroclus|Just restocked on these battle-trinkets, if you'd like one, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat15B|Patroclus Reunion Chat 15 B|Patroclus|You've become quite the talk of all Elysium of late.
PatroclusReunionChat15|Patroclus Reunion Chat 15|Patroclus|Our so-called champion isn't as popular around here as he used to be.
PatroclusReunionChat16|Patroclus Reunion Chat 16|Patroclus|I'm grateful for everything you've done.
PatroclusReunionChat17A|Patroclus Reunion Chat 17 A|Patroclus|For all your patience and your kindness.
PatroclusReunionChat17|Patroclus Reunion Chat 17|Patroclus|I want you to have this.
PatroclusGift01|Patroclus Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey, look, I can tell you're struggling right now, and... maybe this isn't the way to help you through it all, but... I want you to have this.
PatroclusGift01|Patroclus Gift 01|Patroclus|*Ahh*, so you are taking pity on me, then? Well, I've no pride like many others here, so I shall take it. Though, let's make it a fair exchange, shall we?
PatroclusGift02|Patroclus Gift 02|Patroclus|Why would you waste a proper vintage on the likes of me? Questions that are better left unanswered, I would guess.
PatroclusGift02|Patroclus Gift 02|Zagreus|If this eases your burden even for a little while, then it's in good hands, as far as I'm concerned.
PatroclusGift03|Patroclus Gift 03|Patroclus|*Ah*, a means to drown my sorrows temporarily. That's good. And rather kind of you, I have to say.
PatroclusGift03|Patroclus Gift 03|Zagreus|It's nothing. Thank you for not trying to slay me where I stand and boast about it, like seemingly everyone else around here.
PatroclusGift04|Patroclus Gift 04|Patroclus|Oh. Here in Elysium you have to win this stuff, so I have rarely had occasion to enjoy it. Thanks.
PatroclusGift04|Patroclus Gift 04|Zagreus|I'd say you earned it more than anybody else I've seen around here, lately. Though I don't make the rules.
PatroclusGift05|Patroclus Gift 05|Patroclus|You owe me neither time nor generosity, and certainly not this. But if you truly have no better use for it...
PatroclusGift05|Patroclus Gift 05|Zagreus|It's not a matter of owe, sir. Please open your mind to the possibility, nay the fact, that there are those who care about your wellbeing.
PatroclusGift06|Patroclus Gift 06|Patroclus|Just the relief from misery that I was looking for. A fleeting feeling, really, but I'll take a fleeting feeling over none.
PatroclusGift06|Patroclus Gift 06|Zagreus|That's both very dejected and very astute of you to say. Take care of yourself, will you?
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Here, sir. The drink of the gods, themselves. Thought maybe you would like to try it! Just a small token of my appreciation for your selflessness with me, time after time.
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Patroclus|You'd give the precious gift of Ambrosia to someone like me, stranger? A gloried thing like that. Why bother...? I should be just another shade to you.
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Well, you're not. You're someone I look forward to seeing here in Elysium, which is more than I can say for just about anybody else around here, so... please, enjoy it. Perhaps with Achilles.
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Patroclus|Well... perhaps I'll try. You're not so bad, you know that, stranger? Careful with that, or you'll undermine the ruthless reputation that you have.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|I don't see that last bottle of Ambrosia anywhere, which I can only take to mean... you need another. Here, sir. Thanks for seeing me through all of this, time after time.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Patroclus|You're thanking *me*, stranger? I've been here for some time, I think, and yet... some of your customs I'll admit remain quite strange to me. You've done more for me than I've any right to expect, from anyone.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|It's just a bottle of Ambrosia, sir, it's really no big deal. OK, fine, it's rather difficult to come by, but still!
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Patroclus|You jest, but I do not. I'd offer you my lifelong gratitude, but... well, you know.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|You've got the rest of your life ahead of you, as far as I'm concerned. Here's to starting anew, right? You can call me Zagreus, or stranger, whatever suits you.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Patroclus|And... I'm Patroclus, by the way. I'm realizing now... we've not officially met. It's good to know you, Zagreus. Stranger.
PatroclusGift07|Patroclus Gift 07|Patroclus|You're much too kind to such a wretched shade, you know. But I'll not turn away this type of thing.
PatroclusGift07|Patroclus Gift 07|Zagreus|You don't attack me indiscriminately, I give you Nectar. I don't think I'm being over-generous!
PatroclusGift08|Patroclus Gift 08|Patroclus|Forgive my bluntness, but, why go out of your way for me like this...?
PatroclusGift08|Patroclus Gift 08|Zagreus|I'm not going out of my way, sir. Look, I don't pretend to know the depths of your despair. But when I look at you, I'm reminded of how I've often felt. When I was in that dark place, someone said to me: Don't give up. If nothing else... it gives you something to do.
