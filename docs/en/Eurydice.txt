--- Orpheus With Eurydice 01 ---
Orpheus: Why, Zagreus, how wonderful to see you here. Eurydice and I, we have been catching up for all the time we've spent apart.
Eurydice: Yeah. So, if you would excuse us for a little while, hon? I'm not finished catching up with him just yet. But first, before you go!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice 02 ---
Zagreus: I've never heard anything like this. As good as you two sound each on your own, you're positively wonderful together.
Orpheus: A splendid compliment, my friend. Doubtless the Fates themselves conspired to ensure Eurydice and I would meet, and sing together. Fall in love. And then be cruelly separated for some time!
Eurydice: Now don't you start with that again, you get me, Orphy? Got our whole entire afterlives ahead of us! And lots of songs to catch up on.
Orpheus: Why, you're correct of course, my dear. If you'll excuse us, Zagreus? Our calling beckons.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice 03 ---
Zagreus: Hey, you two, how's everything lately? On speaking terms again? Or singing terms?
Orpheus: Oh, things are going very wonderfully, my friend. I never thought I'd see Eurydice again, after I...
Eurydice: Orphy still just can't shut up about that time, hon. But we're making progress. Thanks for having him stop by. I'm sure he needed plenty of encouragement.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 01 ---
Eurydice: Hey, nice of you to visit us, Your Royal Majesty! For you!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 02 ---
Eurydice: Orphy and I, we're doing great here thanks to you. You take care, hon!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 03 ---
Eurydice: Hope you find yourself someone to sing with, too, hon.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 04 ---
Eurydice: Don't fret, Your Majesty, I'll have him back to work on time, you hear that, Orphy?


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 05 ---
Eurydice: Orphy and me, we're like your typical old married couple, hon.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 06 ---
Eurydice: If you find happiness out there, hon, don't look back.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 07 ---
Eurydice: Things aren't so bad here, hon. Hope you can say the same.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 08 ---
Eurydice: What can I say, hon? We like practicing our favorite tune!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 09 ---
Eurydice: Well if it isn't the Hades kid come to pay the both of us a visit!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 18 ---
Eurydice: Guess what we've been up to lately, hon? Now if you'll excuse us?


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 19 ---
Eurydice: We just finished eating, here! Got plenty left over.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 20 ---
Eurydice: The one thing better than singing, hon, is singing with somebody you love.


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 21 ---
Eurydice: Orphy here's just practicing for when he's got to sing next for Hades Senior!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 22 ---
Eurydice: What do you know, we were just in the middle of a song here, hon!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 23 ---
Eurydice: Not much luck trying to teach Orphy to cook, but he can sing, all right!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 24 ---
Eurydice: Look, Orphy, we've got an audience! So sing your heart out!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice Misc Chat 25 ---
Eurydice: Don't mind Orphy, here, hon. Can't snap him out of it once he gets singing!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice In The Blood Chat 01 ---
Eurydice: You know this tune, hon? It's one of our old hits!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice In The Blood Chat 02 ---
Eurydice: We were just thinking about old times, Orphy and I!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice In The Blood Chat 03 ---
Eurydice: Thought we'd mix up our singing just a bit here, hon!


--- Orpheus With Eurydice In The Blood Chat 04 ---
Eurydice: Got to tell you I've warmed up to this old song over the years!


--- Eurydice First Meeting 01 A ---
Eurydice: Hey, you must be the Hades kid! How's it going, then, Your Royal Majesty? Nice to meet you, I'm Eurydice. What brings a big important guy like you up to a place like this?
Zagreus: Hi there! No need for formalities, I'm Zagreus. Just heading out on some official business! Surveying the magma situation firsthand. Don't mean to be rude, though I'm in a bit of a rush.
Eurydice: Well don't you have your hands full, hon! I'll let you go, but there's one rule in my place, which is: Nobody leaves here empty-handed, you got that? So take your pick, my treat!


--- Eurydice First Meeting 01 B ---
Eurydice: Hey you must be the Hades kid! How's it going, then, Your Royal Majesty? Nice to meet you, I'm Eurydice. What brings a big important guy like you up to a place like this?
Zagreus: Hi there! No need for formalities, I'm Zagreus. Just heading out on some official business. Past the menacing Bone Hydra. Don't mean to be rude, though I'm in a bit of a rush.
Eurydice: Well don't you have your hands full, hon! I'll let you go, but there's one rule in my place, which is: Nobody leaves here empty-handed, you got that? So take your pick, my treat!


--- Eurydice First Meeting 01 C ---
Eurydice: Hey you must be the Hades kid! How's it going, then, Your Royal Majesty? Nice to meet you, I'm Eurydice. What brings a big important guy like you up to a place like this?
Zagreus: Hi there! No need for formalities, I'm Zagreus. Just heading out on some official business. Say, if your name's Eurydice, I don't suppose you know an Orpheus, do you? Quite musically inclined, a little dour, impressive hair?
Eurydice: *He *put you up to this? Look, hon, why don't you get on with your business, then. But you can't leave empty-handed, that's the rule, so take your pick, my treat! Nothing for him, though.


--- Eurydice About Orpheus 01 ---
Eurydice: Hey, hon, what's going on, speak up! I know when something's up down to my roots, and something's up.
Zagreus: Well it's just, I think that you may know an Orpheus, don't you? Quite musically inclined, a little dour, impressive hair? He's court musician in my father's house. Calls you his muse. Says he misses you terribly. I... thought you should know.
Eurydice: Orpheus said all that, huh? Tell you what, the next time you run into him, you ask him about the time that he came all this way to try and save me, even though I was already dead. Can you guess how that turned out?
Zagreus: *Erm*... yes, I do believe I can. Look, I didn't mean to upset you.
Eurydice: Yeah, well, neither did he! But you know what? Actions beat intentions, hon. Now, here, how about a treat and you can be on your way.


--- Eurydice About Orpheus 01 B ---
Eurydice: Hey, hon, what's going on, speak up! I know when something's up down to my roots, and something's up.
Zagreus: Well it's just, I think I wanted to tell you more of Orpheus, since... he's court musician in my father's house. Calls you his muse. Says he misses you terribly. I... thought you should know.
Eurydice: Orpheus said all that, huh? Tell you what, the next time you run into him, you ask him about the time that he came all this way to try and save me, even though I was already dead. Can you guess how that turned out?
Zagreus: *Erm*... yes, I do believe I can. Look, I didn't mean to upset you.
Eurydice: Yeah, well, neither did he! But you know what? Actions beat intentions, hon. Now, here, how about a treat and you can be on your way.


--- Eurydice About Orpheus 02 ---
Eurydice: What is it, hon? Oh no, don't tell me you've come all the way from Tartarus to ask me more about your good-for-nothing court musician friend.
Zagreus: Certainly not! I'm merely here for your wonderful singing, cooking, or conversational ability. Though, since you mentioned it, you... seem to have a lot to say to him. Is there anything I can do?
Eurydice: So let me see if I understand. Orpheus blew it with me like an idiot, but now I'm supposed to be reaching out to *him*? Sorry, hon, but that's not happening. The two of us are finished. And, you know what? I think we're finished here, too. If you'll excuse me!


--- Eurydice About Orpheus 03 ---
Eurydice: Hey there, hon! So what do you think, pretty good tune, right? Don't know how come everybody doesn't sing. Lightens the mood, passes the time. What's not to like?
Zagreus: It's a beautiful song. Even though you're angry with him... Orpheus, I mean... you're always singing, still?
Eurydice: Oh it's not Orpheus' song, you kidding me? This one's all mine. He always did like going on about how I'm his muse, well, that's 'cause I wrote half his songs for him! Bet he didn't mention that, did he.
Zagreus: Well, not exactly in those words, but... Orpheus can be a little hard to parse.
Eurydice: He can be a little hard to tolerate. A quality I hope isn't going to rub off on any of his mates. I should get back to practicing, see you.


--- Eurydice About Orpheus 04 ---
Zagreus: Look, Eurydice, I promise not to bother you with this each time, but... you should know your husband's shattered by what happened with the two of you. He's genuinely sorry, and he loves you very deeply, still, I'm sure of it.
Eurydice: *Tsk*... and what am I supposed to do with that, Your Royal Majesty...?
Zagreus: I... I don't know yet. Though, you know what? You shouldn't take my word for it. You should take his.
Eurydice: Don't think I will be running into him anytime soon from what I understand. But you're the Hades kid! You want to pull some strings on our behalf, go right ahead, I guess. But I won't hold my breath. Even if I could.


--- Eurydice Progress With Orpheus 01 ---
Eurydice: So, *uh*, how's Orpheus been doing lately, anyway? Still keeping his hair in those neat little curls? I guess his tan must have faded by now.
Zagreus: Curls? *Erm*, not exactly, no. But he's doing all right! For him. He's started singing again, lately, which was a big step. He never used to, before. Would go on about how he'd lost his muse.
Eurydice: And now he knows I'm out there, still, huh. That's... well, thank you for the update, hon. Music's his gift. Good to know he's not thrown everything away.


--- Eurydice Progress With Orpheus 02 ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, can I ask you for a favor here? Not that you owe me anything, but, would you hear me out?
Eurydice: Yeah, sure, hon, what is it? Though you had better not be asking for my recipes. Closely guarded family secret! I'd say I'd take them to my grave, but... yeah.
Zagreus: It's not your recipes, though they are wonderful. It's your song. I'm sure it'd be a hit around the House! And, I know someone who really needs to hear it. Don't suppose you've got a parchment-copy I could have?
Eurydice: Your Royal Majesty, you want my *song*? You are aware it's called *'Good Riddance'*, right? *Tsk*, but sure, why not. If music's going to be playing in your House, it might as well be great. And let me give you something to go with it.


--- Eurydice Progress With Orpheus Song Reaction 01 ---
Eurydice: ...What'd he say, hon? I mean about the song. Bet he loved it, didn't he! But, I don't know for sure. And I've been wondering, kind of a lot, I guess.
Zagreus: No need to wonder any longer. He sings it beautifully, around the House sometimes. It... has a sadder sound to it than when you sing, but... you've inspired him again. As you've done many times before, from what I know.
Eurydice: Huh. So it's a hit, is what you're saying, then. I had a feeling about that one. Sometimes you put some words together and right then and there, you know that you've got something special.


--- Eurydice Progress With Orpheus 03 ---
Eurydice: What happens now, hon...? What I mean is... now you got me thinking about Orpheus again, so... what am I supposed to do with that?
Zagreus: Even if you can't be together right now, I hope it feels better knowing how much he cares for you. And I will try to pull some strings, like you said. I can't make promises where my father's concerned, but... I'll do everything I can.
Eurydice: Well, what can I tell you? Thanks, Your Royal Majesty. That means a lot. No pressure, though. I've been all right without him all this time, and I will be all right, no matter what. If only he could say the same.


--- Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01 ---
Eurydice: Hey, listen here a moment, Hades kid. Look, I... Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. For bringing Orphy back to me again, and everything.
Zagreus: Eurydice, you're more than welcome, really. You've helped me through the flames of hell, time after time. Least I could do is coax old Orpheus out of his private pit of despair so you and he could set things right between the two of you.
Eurydice: Well, you're a real sweetheart, hon. You'll still be seeing Orphy all the time around your House, but now, I get to see him, too. Nice having something to look forward to, you know? Bet someone out there feels that about you.


--- Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 02 ---
Eurydice: Hey! What's the matter, Your Royal Majesty? You're looking kind of down. Normally you're all smiles, for whatever reason!
Zagreus: Oh, I... well, looking back, all this stuff between you and Orpheus, I realized... well, I hope I wasn't too pushy about the whole thing. It wasn't any of my business to pry into your personal life. I should have asked.
Eurydice: Oh, that? *Pff*, come on, don't even worry about it. If you were being too pushy, you better believe I would have put you back in your place, royalty or not. But hey, can't ever be too careful when it comes to people's past and feelings and stuff, right?


--- Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03 ---
Eurydice: Got to tell you, hon. Orpheus sure is different since last he and I met. You know, back when he was still living and breathing and all.
Zagreus: I think the experience of trying to rescue you, failing, dying, becoming court musician, refusing to sing, then being locked in solitary confinement, then finding out about you probably did a number on him. Why, is everything all right? You seemed to be getting along last I saw.
Eurydice: Oh, we're getting along great! Better than ever. He used to be a bit more of a hotshot, but now it's like, he's a little more... what's the word... sensitive? Now I can always tell exactly what's on his mind.


--- Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 04 ---
Eurydice: Hey, Your Royal Majesty! I must say you've accomplished some truly amazing feats, according to Orphy at least! But don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
Zagreus: Oh, no, he's been boasting of my fabricated exploits to you? I've tried to tell him I was only joking with him but now he just thinks I'm being modest.
Eurydice: That modesty won't get you anywhere with me, either, hon, Your Greatness. I'm honored to merely be in the presence of one with so many wild exploits to sing or speak of!


--- Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 05 ---
Zagreus: Hey did Orpheus really use to have curls, and... something called a tan? I've only ever seen him looking... well, how he does now.
Eurydice: He did! And a tan is like... well, when you stay out in the hot sun up there long enough, your skin kind of starts to bake a little bit. But nicer than that sounds! Got to say, though, the years have been kind to Orphy, don't you think?


--- Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01 ---
Eurydice: Say, tell me something, there, Your Royal Majesty. You know a lot of shades. You wouldn't happen to know an Orpheus, would you? Spindly little thing, whiny voice? Heard he's officially serving in your court. Making music!
Zagreus: Of course I know Orpheus, we're mates! Wait, why do you ask?
Eurydice: You're mates, huh. Just as long as you don't count on him for anything. Hasn't even mentioned me, has he. Well if he ever does, you tell him I am doing great! I'm great.


--- Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01 B ---
Eurydice: What's the latest, hon, anything been happening down in your fancy House lately?
Zagreus: Well, you mentioned Orpheus... my father had him locked up for a little while for refusing to sing. Being court musician and all. But he's out now, and doing OK! I think.
Eurydice: Not following instructions, huh. Sounds like Orpheus, all right. Well, if that's the most exciting thing you've got going on, then I haven't missed much being out here.


--- Eurydice About Hermes 01 ---
Eurydice: Hey, what's up, hon? Say, you must know a lot of big shots, don't you? Other gods and all that?
Zagreus: I know a few. As a matter of fact, I heard recently from Hermes, wanted you to know he felt sorry for how things ended up. That something to do with when Orpheus went in here after you?
Eurydice: Oh, that's sweet of him! Nice enough guy, for an Olympian. Yeah, he was the one who dropped me off here in the first place. No hard feelings here, he was just doing his job. It was Orpheus who messed everything up.


--- Eurydice About Nymphs 01 ---
Eurydice: Sure don't see a lot of other nymphs around here, huh! We don't die too easy, most of us. Makes me feel all special!
Zagreus: I've never met another nymph, now that you mention it. Heard of a few! The goddess Artemis, sounds like she spends more time with nymphs than the other Olympians.
Eurydice: That's what I heard! Though it's not like we all hang out, I mean, you've got the dryads, and the naiads, and the nereids, and the oceanids... pretty much every type of terrain up top, there's a kind of nymph who loves it! Maybe we need a name for Underworld nymphs, too.


--- Eurydice About Persephone 01 ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, did you by any chance ever meet a *Persephone *during the whole thing when Orpheus came down to try to get you?
Eurydice: Oh, her? Yeah, she was with Hades Senior, why? Wait. *Whoa*. Are you...? I thought...
Zagreus: It's complicated. And, please keep it quiet. I was just wondering... what was she like? If you recall.
Eurydice: Didn't get much of an impression, but I can tell you this: She had good taste in music! Orpheus and I, think we won her over with our little duet. Haven't seen or heard from her lately, though. Look, I hope everything's OK.


--- Eurydice About Persephone 01 B ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, did you by any chance ever meet a *Persephone *during the whole thing when Orpheus came down to try to get you?
Eurydice: Oh, her? Yeah, she was with Hades Senior, why? Wait. *Whoa*. Are you...? I thought...
Zagreus: It's complicated. And, please keep it quiet. I was just wondering... what was she like? If you recall.
Eurydice: Didn't get much of an impression, but I can tell you this: She had good taste in music! Orpheus and I, think we won her over with our little duet. Haven't seen or heard from her lately, though.


--- Eurydice Post Epilogue 01 ---
Eurydice: Hey, everybody's saying Persephone... she's back? That sounds like a bit of good news, there, isn't that right, hon?
Zagreus: Hey, she is back, and yes, it is good news, thank you. She and I have a lot of making up for lost time left to do, though I think we're off to a pretty decent start.
Eurydice: Well, that's a relief. And, you're still here! So I guess you've got more official business to take care of, which means I've still got somebody to taste-test for me every now and then!


--- Eurydice Post Epilogue 02 ---
Eurydice: Orphy tells me the Queen, she's been settling in just fine down at your House! Must be different having a lady like that around. How's Hades Senior taking it, if I may ask?
Zagreus: Oh, he's taking it... about as well as he's taken anything ever, now that you mention it. Still very much himself, mind you, but still... it's been a welcome change.
Eurydice: Glad to hear it! Orphy always liked singing for an audience more than I did, and it sounds like she's a good one.


--- Eurydice About Music 01 ---
Eurydice: You ever play any music, or sing or anything yourself, Hades kid? It's good for you, you know!
Zagreus: I play a bit of the lyre, as a matter of fact! Orpheus himself gave me some pointers on it. Never really tried singing, though. I can't even imagine it, really.
Eurydice: Well, might I recommend giving it a shot at some point? Who knows, you might be the next Orpheus!


--- Eurydice About Onions 01 ---
Eurydice: You been snacking on *onions *or something, there, hon? No offense or anything, but you smell like you ate a whole one of them raw.
Zagreus: *Erm*, yes, but... wait. How else are you supposed to eat those things?
Eurydice: What, are you kidding me? You can grill them, sauté them, fry them, boil them, pickle them, roast them! Oh, hon. You've been missing out.


--- Eurydice About Love 01 ---
Eurydice: You got anyone special in your life, by the way, hon? You seem like you'd be good for somebody out here.
Zagreus: You know what, yes, I do, Eurydice. Things have moved so fast for me lately I barely stopped to think about it, though. It helps not having to go through everything alone... just knowing I'll see them again soon.
Eurydice: Know what you mean. And hey, that's great! Long as you can still be yourself. I've known too many nymphs, their whole lives revolved around somebody they loved. I bet whoever it is that loves you... it's because of who you are.


--- Eurydice Misc Meeting 01 ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, how long have you been down here, anyway, if you don't mind my asking? Seems like you're pretty settled in. It's quite a lovely place!
Eurydice: How long have I been down here, hon? *Huh*! I don't have the faintest. You lose your sense of time once you're a shade, or maybe once there's not a sun or moon over your head. But yeah, I found myself a decent spot and fixed it up a bit!


--- Eurydice Misc Meeting 02 ---
Eurydice: You're just in time, Your Royal Majesty! Got something real good cooking right here that you are going to love. You hungry, yeah?
Zagreus: Am I ever. You're always so generous. And you're always cooking! And singing. Do you have many guests come by? Your place seems... somewhat off the beaten path.
Eurydice: What, you think I get a lot of guests, here? *Haha*, no, but I like cooking anyway! It's like singing, in a way. Keep getting better the more you try, turns out a bit different each time.


--- Eurydice Misc Meeting 03 ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, how can you cook so much with all the searing heat around these parts? Has it been magma-flooded like this all the time?
Eurydice: The searing heat? *Haha*, I am dead, Your Royal Majesty! Searing's just a cooking technique to me. Don't need to sleep, either! I can just keep cooking up a storm. It's not so bad!


--- Eurydice Misc Meeting 04 ---
Zagreus: You know, I've never met a nymph before. You're closer to the gods than mortals, right?
Eurydice: Yeah, gods that can *die*! How is that fair? Was just a stupid snake bite in my case, can you imagine something more embarrassing? You're just minding your business, and then *snap*! You're dead, and on your way down here.
Zagreus: I... know the feeling better than you might expect.
Eurydice: Well, I was going to end up here sooner or later. Might as well while I'm still looking good. Though, I guess you do kind of get to lock in whatever age when you register. Bet everybody dying of old age pushed that one through.


--- Eurydice Misc Meeting 05 ---
Eurydice: What's your official business, anyway, Your Royal Majesty? Seems like it's bringing you through Asphodel an awful lot lately.
Zagreus: It's... look, the truth is, I am trying to get out of here. I've hit some stumbling blocks along the way, but, I think I will make it there, eventually.
Eurydice: Oh really! Say no more, I know how that is. Hope the Fates will look the other way for you. Getting out of here, huh. Not thought of that myself in I don't know how long...


--- Eurydice Misc Meeting 06 ---
Eurydice: Of all the lava rocks in Asphodel, the Hades kid found this one once again, wouldn't you know! You got a map or something to this place, or what?
Zagreus: Don't know that a map would help me much since things keep shifting out here every single time. Though it is an interesting coincidence how I keep running into you.
Eurydice: Coincidence? Come on, hon, you're a god. Someone out there is sending you my way. Maybe it's just the Fates. Ah well! I sure don't mind a little company. And I have lots to eat!


--- Eurydice About Acorn 01 ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, wanted to thank you once again for this enchanted acorn that you gave me. So this is what plants and things grow from, up on the surface?
Eurydice: Oh, not just any plants, hon! Trees! Big gnarled oaks and things. Some of them live hundreds of years! Way up there as mortals go. You take good care of it like that, maybe it'll grow to be something special for you, too!


--- Eurydice About Acorn 02 ---
Zagreus: Hey, this is sort of a weird question, but... this Evergreen Acorn, it's not... related to you, is it? Since, you know, you're... partly oak, aren't you?
Eurydice: Yeah, I'm part oak, that's right. But maybe not the part you're thinking of, I mean, you think I would just hand you one of my babies or something? *Hahahaha*, that's disgusting!


--- Eurydice About Distant Memory 01 ---
Eurydice: Hold on, hon, is that... *huh*! Almost felt like Orpheus was with you there. Would you listen to me? Must have been singing too many high notes, or something.
Zagreus: No, wait, you're onto something... I think you must have sensed Orpheus' Distant Memory! He gave it to me as a keepsake of our friendship. Though, something like this... I feel like it should belong to you.
Eurydice: Oh, that's him in there all right! See, I never should have second-guessed myself. Well, you hang onto that, as I've got plenty memories of him already, thanks!


--- Eurydice Low Health 01 ---
Eurydice: Oh, hon, you look awful. What did you get yourself into? Here, one of these should make you feel a little better.


--- Eurydice Low Health 02 ---
Eurydice: Oh, you look like you've been through a lot, Hades kid. Maybe a decent bite to eat will help!


--- Eurydice Low Health 03 ---
Eurydice: *Oof*, you're a mess, there, hon. You save your strength and see if this will do you any good.


--- Eurydice Low Health 04 ---
Eurydice: Hey, don't go bleeding on my floor, hon. I just cleaned the place! Take one of these, maybe it'll tide you over.


--- Eurydice Chat 01 ---
Eurydice: Why not have a quick bite of something to eat before you head on out, hon?


--- Eurydice Chat 02 ---
Eurydice: Sing when you're happy, sing when you're not, Your Royal Majesty.


--- Eurydice Chat 03 ---
Eurydice: Hey, it's the Hades kid! So what's it going to be this time, Your Royal Majesty?


--- Eurydice Chat 04 ---
Eurydice: I'd say make yourself at home, hon, but you look like you got cooler places to be!


--- Eurydice Chat 05 ---
Eurydice: You are just in time, Your Royal Majesty! Cooked up something special just for you.


--- Eurydice Chat 06 ---
Eurydice: Why, Your Royal Majesty, you're back! Well, see you later!


--- Eurydice Chat 07 ---
Eurydice: And here I was just thinking it's been too long since the Hades kid stopped by!


--- Eurydice Chat 08 ---
Eurydice: So what'll it be this time, Your Royal Majesty, hmm?


--- Eurydice Chat 09 ---
Eurydice: Oh you look positively famished, hon! Here let me help with that.


--- Eurydice Chat 11 ---
Eurydice: You must be hungry, hon. Got something ought to keep you going!


--- Eurydice Chat 12 ---
Eurydice: How nice of you to stop on by, Your Royal Highness! Here!


--- Eurydice Chat 13 ---
Eurydice: How's it going lately, hon, you eating well and everything?


--- Eurydice Chat 14 ---
Eurydice: Just singing to myself and cooking up a storm. You know me, hon.


--- Eurydice Chat 15 ---
Eurydice: Eat up, hon! Not like I got other mouths to feed!


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 01 ---
Eurydice: All's well in Asphodel, Your Royal Majesty! You take care of yourself. I'll be here.


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 02 ---
Eurydice: You want the best cooking in all of Asphodel, you know where to go!


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 03 ---
Eurydice: Hey, it's the Hades kid! What's it going to be this time, hm?


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 04 ---
Eurydice: Take care of yourself out there, all right, Your Royal Majesty?


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 05 ---
Eurydice: Don't let Hades Senior get you down, hon. Here.


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 06 ---
Eurydice: I know you've got important business to attend to, so thanks for checking in, Your Royal Majesty.


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 07 ---
Eurydice: You look like you're in a rush, though there's always time for a quick snack, right?


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 08 ---
Eurydice: Hey, welcome back, Your Royal Majesty, you're just in time!


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 09 ---
Eurydice: Been trying to perfect these recipes for I don't know how long!


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 10 ---
Eurydice: You look like you haven't eaten since you were here last!


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 11 ---
Eurydice: You're always welcome here Your Royal Majesty.


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 12 ---
Eurydice: I get you something for the road there, hon?


--- Eurydice Chat Extra 13 ---
Eurydice: What's it going to be, Your Royal Majesty?


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 01 ---
Eurydice: You just be sure to tell that good-for-nothing Orpheus I'm looking good.


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 02 ---
Eurydice: Hon, I'd ask how old what's-his-name is doing, but I don't even care!


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 03 ---
Eurydice: Bet you Orpheus hasn't had any strokes of musical genius lately, now, has he?


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 05 ---
Eurydice: Better not be Orpheus putting you up to visiting here all the time like this.


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 06 ---
Eurydice: This song's better than anything Orpheus ever came up with I can tell you that.


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 07 ---
Eurydice: If you'll excuse me, Your Royal Majesty, I'm not exactly in the mood for an extended chat.


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 09 ---
Eurydice: You best have no more messages from no-good Orpheus this time.


--- Eurydice Mad Chat 10 ---
Eurydice: Here, have a snack, hon, and tell Orpheus it was delicious.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 01 ---
Eurydice: You keep an eye on Orpheus for me, all right, hon?


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 02 ---
Eurydice: Do one thing for me, hon. Make sure Orpheus knows I'll be right here.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 03 ---
Eurydice: I've got to be honest with you, hon. Sometimes I kind of miss him.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 04 ---
Eurydice: Sometime you'll visit me like this and Orpheus is going to be here too.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 05 ---
Eurydice: Don't let Orpheus get into too much trouble, won't you, hon?


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 06 ---
Eurydice: I'm fine here on my own, hon. But, I wouldn't mind if he was here.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 07 ---
Eurydice: Hope Orpheus is on the up-and-up down where you live.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 08 ---
Eurydice: I'd ask you to bring one of these to Orpheus, but they're no good unless they're perfectly fresh.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 09 ---
Eurydice: Orpheus tells me you've been a good friend. Thanks, hon.


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 10 ---
Eurydice: I love Orpheus and all, hon, but it's nice having a little time here to myself!
Eurydice: I know you can't stay long, hon, so eat up and stay safe out there, all right?


--- Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 11 ---
Eurydice: I sing when Orpheus is here, I sing when he isn't. Simple!


--- Eurydice Gift 01 ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, thank you for making me feel welcome in your pleasant home. Can't say the same for most places I've been lately. I've a small gift I wanted you to have.
Eurydice: *Aw*, that's awful sweet of you, Your Royal Majesty. Bringing me fresh ingredients like this! Know what, here's something for you, too, help keep you safe out there!


--- Eurydice Gift 02 ---
Eurydice: Just the ingredient I needed, hon, thank you so much! You know, you aren't near as bad as I'd heard!
Zagreus: Oh, don't worry, we're still getting to know each other! Plenty of time for me to live up to my notorious reputation. Though I'm surprised you've heard of me at all.


--- Eurydice Gift 03 ---
Eurydice: *Aw*, for me, really, Your Majesty? This will be perfect for my latest recipes.
Zagreus: You know, of all the souls I've ever met, I feel like you put this stuff to the best possible use.


--- Eurydice Gift 04 ---
Eurydice: You read my mind, hon! I go through this stuff awful fast sometimes.
Zagreus: And I, in turn, shall go through your incredible cooking awful fast, given the opportunity.


--- Eurydice Gift 05 ---
Eurydice: Hey, mighty generous of you to keep me stocked up on this stuff, Your Royal Majesty!
Zagreus: My pleasure! I'm always pleased to see you during my otherwise generally unfortunate travels in Asphodel.


--- Eurydice Gift 06 ---
Eurydice: Thanks, Your Majesty! Though you're not going to get in trouble bringing me this stuff, are you?
Zagreus: *Hah*, no! I don't think I can get into more trouble at the moment. May this make your dishes that much more delectable!


--- Eurydice Gift 07 ---
Zagreus: Eurydice, I was thinking maybe this would benefit your culinary practice. Here, please.
Eurydice: Whoa, this is Ambrosia! Hard to come by this stuff around here. You sure I can have this?
Zagreus: Absolutely! Least I could do for all your friendship and support. Always happy to hear your voice when I'm out here.


--- Eurydice Gift 08 ---
Eurydice: I ever tell you you're a real sweetheart, hon? Because, if not, I'm telling you right now. Where would my culinary practice be if not for you?
Zagreus: I think your culinary practice would be every bit as extraordinary, though I'm pleased to have done small service to you in this great pursuit.
Eurydice: Well, we both know you've done a lot more for me than that. I wasn't expecting to make any new friends here anytime soon, so all the more reason it's been a real treat to get to know you. If I may say? You're a hell of a guy, Your Royal Majesty.
