InspectThrone01|Inspect Throne 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Seldom does the overbearing throne of grim Lord Hades sit unoccupied; thus the House's denizens all go about their business, daring not so much as to ask why.
InspectHouseGarden01|Inspect House Garden 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The garden of Persephone the Queen, off-limits to the Prince throughout his life, now is laid bare to him at last in all its splendor.
Flashback02|Flashback 02|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}He ventures toward the stately throne of his Lord Father, half-expecting to be caught, but ill-expecting what he is about to find.
Flashback03|Flashback 03|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}He does not know exactly what he seeks. He only knows that something always has felt off to him, that he does not belong. Who is he, really? Lord Hades never would indulge such questions. So, Prince Zagreus would find out for himself.
Flashback04|Flashback 04|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}He rifles through his Lord Father's possessions. There is not much of any import there. Ledgers and administrative parchmentwork. Correspondence from Olympus which he had ignored. No trace of any reference to his son.
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}But then, there is the note... written finely in a hand and voice the likes of which the Prince had never seen or heard.
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Persephone|{#DialogueItalicFormat}'Hades: I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place. So, I am leaving, even if it kills me. I won't be returning to Olympus. If there is a place where I belong in this world, it must be somewhere between heaven and hell. Perhaps it's on the coast and has a little garden. Take care of Cerberus; I shall miss him.'
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Thus did Prince of the Underworld Zagreus absorb the contents of this hidden letter, written in his mother's hand.

Flashback06|Flashback 06|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Persephone... the one-time Queen of all the Underworld... where had she gone, and why? Engulfed by newfound questions and his rage, the Prince decided to confront his Lord and Master.
Flashback_DayNightJob_02|Flashback Day Night Job 02|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Responsibility-rejecting Zagreus strides down his Father's hall, quite unconcerned about the urgency with which he is expected to behave under a set of circumstances such as this.
Flashback_DayNightJob_03|Flashback Day Night Job 03|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The door to the administrative chamber beckons just beyond the hall. The prince perchance believes that he may enter quietly, without drawing the notice of those laboring within.

Flashback_DayNightJob_01|Flashback Day Night Job 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The heavy-sleeping Underworld Prince arises, with the feeling that the brief nap he intended as a respite from the rigors of the day or night apparently was none-too-brief, at all...

InspectBedroom_AphroditePoster|Inspect Bedroom Aphrodite Poster|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The visage of the goddess Aphrodite now adorns the Prince's bedchambers, perhaps to provide consolation after when next he dies.
InspectBedroom_DionysusPoster|Inspect Bedroom Dionysus Poster|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The ever-smiling, wine-washed countenance of the great Lord Dionysus now adorns the Prince's chamber-wall, thus radiating questionable influence.

Flashback01|Flashback 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}All is quiet at this time; ever-dreaming Hypnos put a spell upon the House, as willful Zagreus had asked of him. All are fast asleep, save for the Prince. It is exactly as he planned.

Inspect_DeathAreaOffice_SealedContract_03|Inspect Death Area Office Sealed Contract 03|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Buried deep within the archives, holding many binding pacts between Lord Hades and the dead, resides an old agreement; an exchange for services from an extraordinary warrior, for eternity within Elysium for his dear partner.
Flashback_DayNightJob_Office_01|Flashback Day Night Job Office 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The day or night's duties are sheer simplicity itself; at least at first, as when the prince simply signs in to signal the commencement of his shift.

Flashback_DayNightJob_Office_05|Flashback Day Night Job Office 05|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The relaxation-loving prince never paid suitably enough attention to learn properly how to arrange the record-bookings of the regions of his father's realm.
Flashback_DayNightJob_Office_06|Flashback Day Night Job Office 06|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}This set of delicate responsibilities is easily achieved, at least by someone capable and trained to do the work, unlike the oft-distracted Underworld Prince.
Flashback_DayNightJob_Office_07|Flashback Day Night Job Office 07|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}A careful record must be kept of all expenses paid within the House; a delicately-handled tabulation process which the prince is ill-equipped to fully undertake.
Flashback_DayNightJob_Office_08|Flashback Day Night Job Office 08|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}A steadily-updated ledger of the House's income in the form of brilliant gemstones, diamonds, Darkness, and the like, is merely one among the prince's least-liked aspects of his work.

MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Zagreus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Uhh{#PreviousFormat}, oh! It's just, I have an odd request. You see, the god of slumber, Hypnos? Colleague of mine. Huge fan. He's in desperate need of your autograph. Little personalized message? I don't suppose you'd be so kind. It'd mean a lot to him.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|Autograph. I see. Then, it appears there are such gods as favor me. I will inscribe a bit of parchment for your colleague, then.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The god-forsaken Minotaur impresses then upon a parchment a brief message to the god of sleep, and gives it to the favor-asking Prince.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|Know, short one, that this favor is for you and not for Hypnos. Though he may challenge me himself, at any time.

CerberusMiscMeeting02|Cerberus Misc Meeting 02|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Each terrifying maw of the infernal watch-dog Cerberus responds affirmatively, one after the next, as if to reassure the ever-doubting Prince.

CerberusMiscMeeting03|Cerberus Misc Meeting 03|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The watch-dog Cerberus merely sulks upon his supple bedroll.

CerberusAboutBall01|Cerberus About Ball 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The hell-forged multi-headed monster feels no urgency to waste his precious time on simple play-things, much preferring to conserve his vast energy reserves in case any trespassers need to be eaten suddenly.
