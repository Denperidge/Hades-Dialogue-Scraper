ZeusWithAres01|Duo - Zeus and Ares (1)|Zeus|Nephew! By my divine authority, my oft-misunderstood son, Ares, now shall lend you a small token of his power. I'll make him helpful yet!
ZeusWithAres01|Duo - Zeus and Ares (1)|Ares|It shall be exactly as you say, Lord Father. Your wishes are identical to mine.
AresWithPoseidon01|Duo - Ares and Poseidon (1)|Ares|Well, my hellborn kin, I have to say that there are times I wish I could have been acquainted with your father somewhat more, if you'll forgive my saying so. My father and my uncle, here... they're predisposed quite differently than I.
AresWithPoseidon01|Duo - Ares and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|Perhaps if you were not so odd, and made more effort to be somewhat more approachable, Ares, then we'd have more in common, you and I! Should you need any tips on that, why, you just let me know!
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Ares|I wished only to speak to you in private once again, my kin, except, you see...
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Athena|...Except you see, dear Cousin, that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable. I caution you around my half-brother, is all. Now carry on.
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Ares|You interrupt me once again, dear sister. You know I do not care for that. I warn you to stay out of my affairs. I shall aid my kin as I see fit.
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Athena|You only do as you see fit, Lord Ares. Mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all.
AresWithAphrodite01|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (1)|Ares|I so anticipate the day you finally arrive upon Olympus. There are few amongst us here with interests such as those I think we share.
AresWithAphrodite01|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|There are at least a few of us who share such interests here, isn't that so, Lord Ares? As for *you*, dearest, you take all the time you need!
AresWithAphrodite02|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (2)|Ares|Wars waged over love, my kin... can you imagine that? The lady Aphrodite and I can endlessly discuss such circumstances. I trust, from time to time, you stop to ask yourself how come you choose to fight. Not that you need a reason, of course.
AresWithAphrodite02|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (2)|Aphrodite|Oh, Lord Ares, truly there isn't the need to cloud our little godling's thoughts and judgment with such comments, is there, *hm*? Let's give him what he wants, and we can carry on in private, about that.
AresWithDionysus01|Duo - Ares and Dionysus (1)|Ares|Ah, my kin! I was just inquiring with Lord Dionysus here, under which circumstances are the greatest mortal feasts of all prepared? Because I have a certain hunch, regarding that...
AresWithDionysus01|Duo - Ares and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|Yeah, yeah, Ares, I will hand it to you, man. There's nothing like a feast after a war, all right! Provided you're on the surviving side, that is! Otherwise I guess they'll be feasting with *you *down there, Zag!
AresWithDemeter01|Duo - Ares and Demeter (1)|Ares|The cold of death is quite becoming of the Goddess Demeter, do you not think so, my death-dealing kin? She is becoming well accustomed to it, too.
AresWithDemeter01|Duo - Ares and Demeter (1)|Demeter|I think that you forget yourself, Lord Ares, sir. For I am much your elder; my famines had already slain the mortals by the tens of thousands by the time such thoughts of doing so first crossed your mind.
AresKillQuestComplete|Ares Kill Quest Complete|Ares|Ten thousand souls have fallen to you, now, my hellborn kin. I am rather beside myself, I must admit. Fine work.
AresAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Ares About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Here goes, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lord Ares, please consider our proposal... once you're able to decipher it.
AresAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Ares About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Ares|My, what is this, my kin? Some sort of invitation for me, I presume. Not just for me... this symbolizes all the others, here? Most intriguing. I shall investigate the meaning of this as quickly as I'm able, then. But first!
AresPostEpilogue01|Ares Post Epilogue 01|Ares|I wish to tell you once again I had a splendid time during our recent shared festivities, my kin. At last, I've finally seen your death-filled realm firsthand! I learned a great deal. And I look forward to learning more from our successful collaboration, hm?
AresAboutZeus01|Ares About Zeus 01|Ares|Lord Zeus has gotten to you first, I see? My father's gifts are generous, indeed, though... I think I can help in my own way.
AresAboutPoseidon01|Ares About Poseidon 01|Ares|The blessing of your uncle Lord Poseidon might have helped you to this point, but here: My gift shall see you further still.
AresAboutAthena01|Ares About Athena 01|Ares|You bear the blessing of Athena, yes? She would protect you from your enemies, whilst I would rather that you slay them, and be done.
AresAboutAphrodite01|Ares About Aphrodite 01|Ares|*Mm*, I see you have the Lady Aphrodite's blessing there already. Love and death, together, hand in hand? Sounds most agreeable to me.
AresAboutArtemis01|Ares About Artemis 01|Ares|So Artemis, my lonely half-sister, got to you first? She merely helps you hunt, whilst I shall help you kill. Observe.
AresAboutDionysus01|Ares About Dionysus 01|Ares|That drunkard Dionysus cannot help you near as much as I, my hell-born kin. Compare the gift he gave to what I offer you.
AresAboutHermes01|Ares About Hermes 01|Ares|Our messenger Hermes has been in contact with you by now, yes? Perhaps you shall not see him very often, for my work keeps him rather preoccupied, shepherding souls and such.
AresAboutDemeter01|Ares About Demeter 01|Ares|I faintly sense the mark of Goddess Demeter upon you, *hm*? Her power over plentitude is opposite to mine in some respects. But, lately, she has channeled it in manners more agreeable to me.
AresAboutHadesKeepsake01|Ares About Hades Keepsake 01|Ares|Ah, you bear your own father's blessing, my kin? Such a surprise... I know the two of you are now in league, and yet... I am still quite accustomed to the thought that you harbor war-like hatred for one another. Perhaps there's still a trace of that, though, hm?
AresKillProgress01|Ares Kill Progress 01|Ares|Did you happen to know, my kin, that you have slain more than a hundred foes since you began your quest? You have! For I am keeping count. And I am most impressed.
AresKillProgress02|Ares Kill Progress 02|Ares|You are a most impressive death-dealer, my kin. For by my estimation, you have slain at least a thousand souls down there! Souls mostly having died before, but still.
AresKillQuest01|Ares Kill Quest 01|Ares|I know that you have many aspirations, my good kin. To be plain with you about my own motive for a moment: As long as you continue bringing swift and steady death, you shall have my unyielding support.
AresKillQuestAftermath01|Ares Kill Quest Aftermath 01|Ares|The more you slay your enemies, my kin, the stronger the bond between us, I think. Can you not feel it, too? Though, perhaps your lust for blood overpowers your other senses, hm?
AresAboutThanatos01|Ares About Thanatos 01|Ares|Perhaps you know a god called Thanatos? The two of us are very close associates, you know. Do give him my best wishes, should you see him soon.
AresAboutThanatos02|Ares About Thanatos 02|Ares|I trust that Thanatos is doing well? Although he brings to mortals merciful release, whilst I most certainly do *no *such thing, I do appreciate his take on it.
AresAboutThanatos03|Ares About Thanatos 03|Ares|It is my understanding that you have grown rather close with Thanatos, my kin? A perfect choice of mate; though I confess I'd not expected Death to have affection for another save himself.
AresRunProgress01|Ares Run Progress 01|Ares|You traveled rather far down there since last we met, my kin. And that means you have dealt incalculable death. I must commend you thus.
AresRunProgress02|Ares Run Progress 02|Ares|*Ahh*, my kin! I sensed fresh bloodshed from you recently, the real kind! For you have slain the living near the surface, have you not? Mere vermin, yes, but good enough for me.
AresRunCleared01|Ares Run Cleared 01|Ares|Recently, there was a burst of violence on the surface, near to where you are, but higher up. 'Twas altogether odd, but must have forced you to return once more. No matter; time is on our side.
AresRunCleared02|Ares Run Cleared 02|Ares|I sense so much death at the gates of your father's realm, of late, my kin. Now, I know that seems perfectly ordinary on the face of it, except... there's something more. I wonder if *you *know the reason why...
AresRunCleared03|Ares Run Cleared 03|Ares|I know your efforts to come here have repeatedly been thwarted, my good kin. However, we have caused such violence in the intervening time, that we must take this as a real victory. Let us continue for however long it takes.
AresAboutWar01|Ares About War 01|Ares|Surely you've heard rumblings about a war which has erupted on the surface, here? Doubtless you've seen an influx of fallen mortals. It's quite a decent one, I have to say! Though, unlikely to rise to the ranks of the greats. Too few armies involved in it, I fear.
AresAboutWar02|Ares About War 02|Ares|War's such a wondrous thing, my kin. It solves so many different problems, whilst perpetuating its own inevitability. Let's keep it up, then, hm?
AresAboutWar03|Ares About War 03|Ares|Do you ever think to yourself that you were born a bit too late, my kin? For my part, I wish that I could have been there myself when my father and the others waged ferocious war against the Titans. Ah, it must have been a sight!
AresAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Ares About Weapon Enchantments 01|Ares|I sense that you have forged a greater bond with your instruments of destruction there, my kin. Then that is very good. And may their altered forms serve you quite well.
AresAboutGuanYuAspect|Ares About Guan Yu Aspect|Ares|Why, I believe that is the Frost Fair Blade you bear! I understand it shall become the instrument of choice of yet another god of war, someday. I long to meet him, this fellow student of death.
AresAboutArthurAspect|Ares About Arthur Aspect|Ares|Ah, that blade of yours... it looks as though it could relieve a mortal of his head with ease. Excalibur, is it? I've studied all the Fates' designs, and this one is among my favorites.
AresAboutRamaAspect01|Ares About Rama Aspect 01|Ares|The fated bow Sharanga, in your grasp! That is not a form I'd expected you to wield. You have exquisite taste in weaponry, my kin!
AresAboutBeowulfAspect01|Ares About Beowulf Aspect 01|Ares|Is that the fire-eating shield of the great warrior Beowulf, which you have there? I knew the Fates had plans for it, but I did not expect for you to be a part!
AresAboutGilgameshAspect01|Ares About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Ares|Those are the gauntlets of the fated king Gilgamesh, are they not? A bringer of destruction, and an agent of the Fates. You are full of surprises, my kin!
AresAboutLuciferAspect01|Ares About Lucifer Aspect 01|Ares|You bear the warring instrument of one called Lucifer, I see. I've little to go on about him, but it is clear he knows a thing or two about destruction, is it not?
AresAboutKeepsake01|Ares About Keepsake 01|Ares|Ah, you bear the Blood-filled Vial which I granted you! The mortal's blood contained therein... I drew it myself! Too seldom am I able to become directly involved in such matters.
AresBackstory01|Ares Backstory 01|Ares|Know that I admire your Lord Father very much. For his grim work lets me continue mine. I trust that one day you shall settle your dispute.
AresPostFlashback01|Ares Post Flashback 01|Ares|You are the son of Night herself, they say? A fascinating character, ill-liked upon Olympus, although I myself have always longed to meet her.
AresPostGiftPickup01|Ares Post Gift Pickup 01|Ares|Ah, my favorite Underworld death-dealer. I so look forward to the pain you shall inflict this time around.
AresPostGiftPickup02|Ares Post Gift Pickup 02|Ares|Would that a sudden scourge of war would help you out of your predicament. Why, I would stir one up for you without a second thought.
AresPostGiftPickup03|Ares Post Gift Pickup 03|Ares|Ah, my closest kin in all the Underworld, I see you there, I think! What sort of violence shall we sow together this time, you and I?
AresPostGiftPickup04|Ares Post Gift Pickup 04|Ares|There's so much insufferable talk of peace up here, my kin. It is quite the relief to focus on much more important things, with you.
AresPostGiftPickup05|Ares Post Gift Pickup 05|Ares|You must know I often hunger for destruction, almost uncontrollably at that. Though I am finding you are able to sate that appetite of mine.
AresPostGiftPickup06|Ares Post Gift Pickup 06|Ares|May all the death you bring become the stuff of legends told in fearful mortal whisperings around the world, my kin.
AresAboutNyxIntro01|Ares About Nyx Intro 01|Ares|Would that I knew the goddess Nyx, myself, my kin! So many of my wars are waged by night. I am most grateful, and I wish her well.
AresAboutNyx01|Ares About Nyx 01|Ares|How is your mother Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.
AresAboutNyx01_B|Ares About Nyx 01 B|Ares|How is Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.
AresAboutNyx02|Ares About Nyx 02|Ares|Do tell your mother Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here, although we haven't met. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.
AresAboutNyx02_B|Ares About Nyx 02 B|Ares|Do tell Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.
AresAboutNyx03|Ares About Nyx 03|Ares|Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and your dark mother, Nyx, some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.
AresAboutNyx03_B|Ares About Nyx 03 B|Ares|Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and the goddess Nyx some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.
AresAboutNyx04|Ares About Nyx 04|Ares|Your mother Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?
AresAboutNyx04_B|Ares About Nyx 04 B|Ares|The goddess Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?
AresAboutNyx05|Ares About Nyx 05|Ares|You shall be pleased to hear that your own mother Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.
AresAboutNyx05_B|Ares About Nyx 05 B|Ares|You shall be pleased to hear that Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.
AresAboutNyx06|Ares About Nyx 06|Ares|Please send your mother Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.
AresAboutNyx06_B|Ares About Nyx 06 B|Ares|Please send the goddess Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.
AresPostEpilogue02|Ares Post Epilogue 02|Ares|You know, my kin, I had misunderstood that Nyx was your mother. But, Persephone? I never took her for the sort to have an interest in your realm. Alas that we never had opportunity to discuss the subject here.
AresPostEpilogue03|Ares Post Epilogue 03|Ares|Your good mother, Persephone... dread Queen of the Underworld! I certainly misjudged her when we had occasion to interact whilst she resided on Olympus. Perhaps I, too, should consider a life there in your realm...
AresHasWeapon01|Ares Has Weapon 01|Ares|You bear Varatha, the Eternal Spear...! I thought it lost! Have you any idea how many lives it drank during your father's glory days?
AresHasWeapon02|Ares Has Weapon 02|Ares|Ah, you wield Coronacht, the Heart-Seeker. It pierced three Titans in one shot back in the war amongst our kind. Please do take care of it!
AresHasWeapon03|Ares Has Weapon 03|Ares|You have the Shield of Chaos, Aegis... quite unlike the one my good sister Athena likes to flash around. You have much better taste.
AresHasWeapon04|Ares Has Weapon 04|Ares|Why, you are wielding Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! A most fascinating device. Imagine the new face of war, should its secrets someday be revealed, and spread to mortalkind!
AresHasWeapon05|Ares Has Weapon 05|Ares|Well if it isn't Malphon, the Twin Fists, bound to your very capable hands! So many weapons are so indirect, I think. With Malphon, you are about as close to the destruction as can be.
AresLegendaryPickUp01|Ares Legendary Pick Up 01|Ares|The greatest wars require great alliances, my kin. And so, I shall entrust to you some of the greatest methods of destruction I've devised thus far.
AresLegendaryPickUp02|Ares Legendary Pick Up 02|Ares|The winds of war blow fiercely on the surface now, my kin. Thus I am able to confer upon you even greater power than has been my custom.
AresLowHealth01|Ares Low Health 01|Ares|You seem to be upon the verge of death, my kin. I cannot wait to hear of it! The experience of death, time after time! You are one of a kind!
AresLowHealth02|Ares Low Health 02|Ares|Ah, my kin, but you have suffered terribly to come this far. No matter, for we soon shall pay your enemies in kind.
AresLowHealth03|Ares Low Health 03|Ares|So much letting of blood, so much of it, your own. Let's see to keeping you alive and in the fight a while longer, then.
AresLowHealth04|Ares Low Health 04|Ares|You're on the verge of yet another brush with death, I see, my hell-born kin. Do send some others down with you, would you?
AresLowHealth05|Ares Low Health 05|Ares|A mortal surely would have already succumbed to injuries such as the ones you've suffered, there. Impressive how you carry on, like that.
AresFirstPickUp|Ares First Pick Up|Zagreus|This one was bound to show up I guess. In the name of Hades! Olympus! I accept this message.
AresFirstPickUp|Ares First Pick Up|Ares|You've got quite the fighting spirit in you there, I have to say. Most intriguing, and yet no surprise for someone born in hell itself. You come on out of there, and tell me all about it. I'm a fellow student of death, you see.
AresMiscPickup01|Ares Misc Pickup 01|Ares|I must say you deal death rather exquisitely. Though, perhaps I could be of some further assistance in such matters, yes?
AresMiscPickup02|Ares Misc Pickup 02|Ares|*Ah*! I figured that you must have been the source of all that bloodshed underneath the earth. Let me see if I can make your death-dealing a little more efficient.
AresMiscPickup03|Ares Misc Pickup 03|Ares|Well, my hell-born kin, my blessing now is yours to do with as you wish; provided you inflict a little suffering for me?
AresMiscPickup04|Ares Misc Pickup 04|Ares|I've just the thing for you this time, my kin. May I present my instruments of pain?
AresMiscPickup05|Ares Misc Pickup 05|Ares|I surely hope your bloodshed's going well, and long that there shall be no end to it. I am, as ever, here to serve your benefit.
AresMiscPickup06|Ares Misc Pickup 06|Ares|How fares your endless war against the dead? Let it be known that I am happy to take sides in such affairs. Please, I insist!
AresMiscPickup07|Ares Misc Pickup 07|Ares|Death rears its head in all too many forms, I'm sure you know. Though you may never find them all, I nonetheless encourage you to try.
AresMiscPickup08|Ares Misc Pickup 08|Ares|The wretched dead you face perhaps forget themselves. Go, then, remind them of the agony which brought them to your realm.
AresMiscPickup09|Ares Misc Pickup 09|Ares|Life and death are inextricable, and war is often what connects the two. Don't you agree?
AresMiscPickup10|Ares Misc Pickup 10|Ares|This world has a limitless capacity for pain; and so, it truly is no inconvenience to help you to bring out a little more.
AresMiscPickup11|Ares Misc Pickup 11|Ares|The living and the dead alike desire what I represent. Their appetite for bloodshed cannot easily be sated. A goal to strive for, no?
AresMiscPickup12|Ares Misc Pickup 12|Ares|Perhaps the dead you stand against have long forgotten the experience of anguish and despair. I trust that you shall soon remind them for me?
AresMiscPickup13|Ares Misc Pickup 13|Ares|Beautiful, isn't it? The strife which follows you. You have a real knack for this, and I for one am happy to assist.
AresMiscPickup14|Ares Misc Pickup 14|Ares|Some would question the destruction which you sow, but I shall never do so. I fully understand your impulses. Allow me to indulge them.
AresMiscPickup15|Ares Misc Pickup 15|Ares|Not once has your Lord Father thanked me for delivering vast portions of his clientele. Surely you shall be more grateful for my gifts.
AresMiscPickup16|Ares Misc Pickup 16|Ares|Do you suppose the dead feel pain unlike the living? This is for me an endless fascination, so go on, and give me more to think about.
AresMiscPickup17|Ares Misc Pickup 17|Ares|As you continue waging war against the dead, I gladly lend you my support; family to family, no questions asked.
AresMiscPickup18|Ares Misc Pickup 18|Ares|It is a veritable crime your father distances himself from all the rest of us. It is fortunate that you yourself are not so disagreeable.
AresMiscPickup19|Ares Misc Pickup 19|Ares|Let us together deal some death, shall we?
AresMiscPickup20|Ares Misc Pickup 20|Ares|Shall we continue our campaign against the dead?
AresMiscPickup21|Ares Misc Pickup 21|Ares|What do you say we bring the dead some pain, for old time's sake?
AresMiscPickup22|Ares Misc Pickup 22|Ares|The devastation you have caused has not escaped my notice!
AresMiscPickup23|Ares Misc Pickup 23|Ares|We stand before a golden opportunity, to inflict pain. Let us proceed!
AresMiscPickup24|Ares Misc Pickup 24|Ares|There is no problem war cannot sort out.
AresMiscPickup25|Ares Misc Pickup 25|Ares|Ah there you are, my kin! I have a gift to aid your bloody work.
AresMiscPickup26|Ares Misc Pickup 26|Ares|My blessing be with you, and may death follow in your wake.
AresMiscPickup27|Ares Misc Pickup 27|Ares|Please spread some suffering down there for me, my kin.
AresMiscPickup28|Ares Misc Pickup 28|Ares|I shall empower you to acts of greater violence than before.
AresMiscPickup29|Ares Misc Pickup 29|Ares|War needn't carry out solely above the earth, my kin.
AresMiscPickup30|Ares Misc Pickup 30|Ares|I trust that the destruction which you sow is going well?
AresMiscPickup31|Ares Misc Pickup 31|Ares|The recent devastation which you caused, that was impressive work.
AresMiscPickup32|Ares Misc Pickup 32|Ares|Whenever you bring death, why, you've my full support.
AresMiscPickup33|Ares Misc Pickup 33|Ares|How fares the ceaseless slaying of your foes, quite well, my kin?
AresMiscPickup34|Ares Misc Pickup 34|Ares|Perhaps my blessing shall let you deliver death still more efficiently.
AresMiscPickup35|Ares Misc Pickup 35|Ares|Your father's realm shall be quite full, I think, once you and I are through.
AresMiscPickup36|Ares Misc Pickup 36|Ares|The finest instruments of death at my disposal shall be yours.
AresMiscPickup37|Ares Misc Pickup 37|Ares|I'd like to offer you a choice amongst my most exquisite tools which inflict suffering.
AresMiscPickup38|Ares Misc Pickup 38|Ares|What say we start our next war with a special flair, my kin?
AresMiscPickup39|Ares Misc Pickup 39|Ares|I've not seen ample blood spilled recently, so let's please make up for lost time.
AresMiscPickupExtra01|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 01|Ares|There are so many types of death... and yet, the sudden, violent kind is unsurpassed, I think.
AresMiscPickupExtra02|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 02|Ares|I am quite eager to commence jointly killing your enemies, my kin.
AresMiscPickupExtra03|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 03|Ares|What do you say we start another of our famous killing sprees, my kin?
AresMiscPickupExtra04|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 04|Ares|It's not been long since last I saw bloodshed... but far too long for me, nevertheless.
AresMiscPickupRareExtra01|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 01|Ares|My finest implements of death I now avail to you, my worthy kin.
AresMiscPickupRareExtra02|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 02|Ares|Let us make this blood-letting truly one to remember, then, hm?
AresMiscPickupRareExtra03|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 03|Ares|May you sow such destruction as to shake this mountain to its core, my kin.
AresMiscPickupRareExtra04|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 04|Ares|I shall now give to you the means to wreak such havoc there, my kin!
AresMiscPickupAboutNyx01|Ares Misc Pickup About Nyx 01|Ares|I was quite pleased to hear again from Nyx of late, my kin.
AresMiscPickupAboutNyx02|Ares Misc Pickup About Nyx 02|Ares|May the wondrous goddess Nyx continue to watch over you, and darken the eyes of your foes.
AresMiscPickupAboutNyx03|Ares Misc Pickup About Nyx 03|Ares|To think you have the goddess Nyx's aid, as well as mine!
AresLootBought01|Ares Loot Bought 01|Ares|I knew that foul boatman would come through, and you would find amongst his wares this gift!
AresLootBought02|Ares Loot Bought 02|Ares|I give to you this token of respect, buried though it must have been within the boatman's hoard.
AresLootBought03|Ares Loot Bought 03|Ares|I trust the river-boatman Charon has been keeping plenty busy lately thanks to me?
AresLootBought04|Ares Loot Bought 04|Ares|The boatman Charon ought invest into a boat of more substantial size if he's to keep up with my work, my kin.
AresLootBought05|Ares Loot Bought 05|Ares|Your boatman there is a reliable deliverer of death, it seems. And that makes three of us, I think.
AresRejection01|Ares Rejection 01|Ares|You reject my generous offering of aid? *Hahahaha*, you must not know me very well. Death shall come, regardless, either to your enemies, or you.
AresRejection02|Ares Rejection 02|Ares|You would deny such aid as I would offer you? How rather disappointing. You've more to learn about the art of dealing death, it seems.
AresRejection03|Ares Rejection 03|Ares|An incorrect decision, there, my kin, to side against me thus. Blood needs be shed, and yours is going to suffice.
AresRejection04|Ares Rejection 04|Ares|It seems unwise of you to thus dismiss my offering. Suffer, then, a while by my hand.
AresRejection05|Ares Rejection 05|Ares|Your choice leaves much to be desired here, my kin. My temper I shall keep in check, but only barely so.
AresRejection06|Ares Rejection 06|Ares|A disappointing choice, my kin, and there are consequences to such choices, every single time.
AresRejection07|Ares Rejection 07|Ares|Your course of action here was ill-advised, my kin. For war shall come to you no matter what, as I shall presently reveal.
AresRejection08|Ares Rejection 08|Ares|The whims of our kind are unpredictable, my kin. But you shall find responses to such acts to be the definition of consistency.
AresRejection09|Ares Rejection 09|Ares|I'll not abide such disregard of our past companionship, my kin. In war, one must take sides, and you had best choose mine.
AresRejection10|Ares Rejection 10|Ares|War shall be waged here, no matter what, my kin. But even still, I am dismayed you would have sided against me.
AresRejection11|Ares Rejection 11|Ares|You wish to have a taste of what a war against me would be like? Well, then, I shall oblige.
AresRejection12|Ares Rejection 12|Ares|Did I detect some hesitancy on your part just then? Perhaps you knew that you were making a mistake. No matter; you'll learn now.
AresRejection13|Ares Rejection 13|Ares|You shall not goad me into anger with a petty insult such as this, you know. Nevertheless, there is a price which must be paid for it.
AresMakeUp01|Ares Make Up 01|Ares|A sacrifice in blood is fully paid, and we are squared away. Though think you twice next time before you cross me, hm?
AresMakeUp02|Ares Make Up 02|Ares|Well haven't you withstood my murderous intent! Resilience as this deserves reward, and I am feeling rather generous.
AresMakeUp03|Ares Make Up 03|Ares|It is not often I attempt to kill someone and they survive. Bravo! Our score is settled up for now, so let us carry on as friends.
AresMakeUp04|Ares Make Up 04|Ares|You capably survived my wrath, and I commend you for it. Let us continue on, as friends and kin.
AresMakeUp05|Ares Make Up 05|Ares|I think that we are squared away, for now. Though, do not test my patience further, hm?
AresMakeUp06|Ares Make Up 06|Ares|You crossed the fields of death impressively back there. Though, you are fortunate I'm in a giving mood.
AresMakeUp07|Ares Make Up 07|Ares|When blood is spilled and death is dealt, I simply cannot remain discontented for too long.
AresMakeUp08|Ares Make Up 08|Ares|What I could see of that display of violence you just sowed was thoroughly commendable, my kin. Then, here.
AresMakeUp09|Ares Make Up 09|Ares|Your sacrifice to me just now has moved me to forgiveness for the time; thus shall we call a truce.
AresMakeUp10|Ares Make Up 10|Ares|A war can only last so long, my kin. This one is not worth the pursuit, I think, when we can wage a greater one, together.
AresMakeUp11|Ares Make Up 11|Ares|Ah, after a show of violence such as that, how can I possibly remain upset, my kin?
AresMakeUp12|Ares Make Up 12|Ares|Your slight against me is already forgotten; for I was more than pleased to witness such a monstrous show of force.
AresGift01|Ares Gift 01|Zagreus|Lord Ares, please accept this offering, for giving me such strength as necessary to succeed.
AresGift01|Ares Gift 01|Ares|You are a flatterer, my death-inflicting kin. And I am feeling generous, as well, so here! A small token for you of my affection.
AresGift02|Ares Gift 02|Zagreus|Lord Ares, I honor you for all the strength you've given me to overcome my foes.
AresGift02|Ares Gift 02|Ares|Such a splendid offering, to me! How very thoughtful, there, my kin. I am taken aback, though I accept!
AresGift03|Ares Gift 03|Zagreus|Lord Ares! Please accept this token of my deep appreciation for your generous support.
AresGift03|Ares Gift 03|Ares|An offering, for me? Indeed! How gracious that you keep me in your thoughts. Know that, likewise, I keep you in mine.
AresGift04|Ares Gift 04|Zagreus|Lord Ares, it is my privilege to have met you, and have learned your death-inflicting way.
AresGift04|Ares Gift 04|Ares|I do appreciate this gift to me, although you really shouldn't have! The suffering which you inflict is ample compensation in itself.
AresGift05|Ares Gift 05|Zagreus|You have shown me nothing but respect and granted me your favor repeatedly, Lord Ares. This is the least that I can do, in kind.
AresGift05|Ares Gift 05|Ares|Most often when I'm given offerings, it is with wishes that I lend my favor in a coming war. Yet from you, my kin, I sense no such motive. I'm quite taken aback by that, I must admit.
AresGift06|Ares Gift 06|Zagreus|Lord Ares! As bloodshed has become somewhat of a necessity in my situation, I am very grateful that you're with me in this. I know never to take it for granted.
AresGift06|Ares Gift 06|Ares|You're most gracious with me, my kin; and I remain enthralled as ever by your blood-soaked way of life. I trust the violence I have wrought on your behalf has been quite satisfactory?
AresGift07|Ares Gift 07|Zagreus|I offer this Ambrosia in your name and honor, Lord Ares. To the god of war! How many foes have I vanquished with your aid and guidance? But more than that, I'm pleased to know you, and to be your cousin.
AresGift07|Ares Gift 07|Ares|Ah, such an exquisite gift this is, indeed. Yet, the destruction you have sown, the sheer carnage... nothing can surpass that, I should think. Should you ever go to war, my kin... genuinely go to war, I mean... do look me up. I imagine I would take your side.
ArtemisWithAres01|Duo - Artemis and Ares (1)|Artemis|Zagreus, I wish we all could hear you so that good Lord Ares here might be persuaded that my powers are entirely for different purposes than his!
ArtemisWithAres01|Duo - Artemis and Ares (1)|Ares|Perhaps our skillsets once were meant for different purposes, dear Artemis; but who are we to doubt the end result? Observe what shall transpire once we grant our kin our combined might.
ArtemisWithAres02|Duo - Artemis and Ares (2)|Artemis|Zagreus, I was just hoping for a little privacy before this hunt, which is consistently my preference here, except, you see, Lord Ares always seems to come sniffing about, first sign of any hunting instruments!
ArtemisWithAres02|Duo - Artemis and Ares (2)|Ares|Why, my dear Artemis, the hunt is but a prelude to a war, is that not so? For if all mortalkind knew naught of hunting, why, they would not be nearly so adept at killing one another.
ArtemisWithAres02|Duo - Artemis and Ares (2)|Artemis|Look, Lord Ares, if I lend you better marksmanship ability, you think that you could bother someone else?
AphroditeWithAres01|Duo - Aphrodite and Ares (1)|Aphrodite|I think for many of us, dearest, it can come as a surprise to learn that love and war often go hand in hand. Opposite forces, yet this connects them, doesn't it. The fiercest passions of gods and mortals! Isn't that right, Lord Ares?
AphroditeWithAres01|Duo - Aphrodite and Ares (1)|Ares|Mortals are so bent on clinging to their lives, that many among them would gladly kill for it. The surge of emotion which they feel... one passion is no different from another, Lady Aphrodite, dear.
DionysusWithAres01|Duo - Dionysus and Ares (1)|Dionysus|You know, Zag, maybe once you get here, you could get old Ares to just lighten up a little, you know, man? Always dragging down the mood, with talk of blood, and nastiness, all sorts of stuff like that!
DionysusWithAres01|Duo - Dionysus and Ares (1)|Ares|Why, my Lord Dionysus! I fail to see why such discussion is perceived as unbecoming of a feast. A successfully conducted war is certainly a cause for celebration, is it not?
PoseidonWithAres01|Duo - Poseidon and Ares (1)|Poseidon|Now, little Hades, you must know by now I've other nephews here, don't you? For instance, Ares comes to mind, the god of war! Some mighty wars have taken place at sea, is that not so?
PoseidonWithAres01|Duo - Poseidon and Ares (1)|Ares|Indeed, they have, good Uncle Poseidon. Mortals show great ingenuity when war is concerned; it drives their sense of progress, more than anything at all. Perhaps someday they shall wage war even in Father's skies.
DemeterWithAres01|Duo - Demeter and Ares (1)|Demeter|Young Zagreus, once you arrive, do tell Lord Ares here that his great power's not worth anything without my own. Wars have their causes, among which, many I control.
DemeterWithAres01|Duo - Demeter and Ares (1)|Ares|I do not question that your influence can stir a mortal's impulses toward war, O Goddess Demeter. At least we can agree that our domains are quite compatible!
