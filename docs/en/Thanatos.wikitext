|"Zagreus, you don't have any doors. Why are you always so surprised?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"*Erm*, Meg, Than, what... what are you two... what's going on? Whatever it is, I can explain, or... wait, you're both smiling. Oh... let me just... take this in a moment here."
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"You give Thanatos and me too little credit, Zag. We've known each other longer than you've been alive."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I'd say we know quite a bit by now, all things considered. Isn't that right, Megaera?"
|-
|'''Megaera'''
|"Can't you see we're off duty right now, Zagreus?"
|-

|"Thanatos...! I'd ask you to come in, but... you're already here. It's really good to see you."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Just tell me one thing, Zagreus. Did you really mean what you told me before, that... maybe we ought to... take our time?"

|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...And, lastly, you're forbidden from offering further assistance to Prince Zagreus. Do we understand each other?"
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Why, absolutely, Master Thanatos, I wouldn't think of it! My mind is fully occupied with all the latest boulder-pushing strategies, besides."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Enough! Get back to work, and I'll get back to mine."
|-
! colspan="2" |Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (2)
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"I understand you, Master Thanatos, and will be doing as you say. No more assistance for Prince Zagreus, dead serious this time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Good. It shall be both our skins if you are caught in one of your deceptions. See to it that this doesn't happen."
|-
! colspan="2" |Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...You would be wise to heed my words next time, and fear the consequences of eluding me. Death can be most unpleasant, as I'm sure you know."
|-
|'''Sisyphus'''
|"Well, that's just it, Master Thanatos. I never was terribly fearful of you gods, if you'll forgive my saying so. Far as I can tell, all of you seem to have your struggles much like mortals do. A fear of death aside."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What would you know of the struggles of gods? Now you have eternity to think on what you've done. Maybe I'll check again with you after another aeon or two, see if you've learned anything more."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Home First Meeting
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Go about your business, Zag. What if Lord Hades saw us chatting like this, now...? I risked everything by helping you out there, and still you failed."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Turns out there's quite a lot of dead to fight down in the Underworld. Though I probably got farther than I would have, thanks to you."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Always happy to oblige. Especially when it causes me to risk my station. To risk everything I've worked for."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Home First Meeting Alt
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What are you doing back here, Zagreus? I risked everything by helping you out there. So that was all for nothing, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Far from it, Than. I got where I needed to go, and if not for your help, maybe I wouldn't have. As for why I'm back... as Father would say, I have some business to attend to, here."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Well! Don't let me stop you, then. Always happy to risk my station for your sake. To risk everything I've worked for."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Home Misc Meeting 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Be on your way, Zagreus. I have an audience with Lord Hades in a moment. An inquiry into my recent absences."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What are you worried about, Than? You've never given him a reason not to trust you."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Recently, I'm not so sure. Whatever you're doing, it had better be worth it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Home Run Progress 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I still cannot entirely believe you really think there's any way you're getting out of here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why? You've been out. It's thanks to you the mortals end up down here maybe half the time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"That's different, that's my job. I can't stay there, and frankly I can barely stand it. Do you have any idea how bright it gets, up there?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No. But I look forward to finding out for myself."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"*Tsch*, well. We'll see what the Fates have to say about that. Maybe the shade of Daedalus can make you some protective eyewear or something."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Home Run Progress 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, the world outside... didn't you say that it would make you sick, being out there for very long at all? I understand now what you meant by that. Beautiful place and all, but... it's good to be back."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"See what I mean, now, Zag? Nice place to visit on occasion, sure. But I definitely wouldn't want to live there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Backstory 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I met her, you know. Persephone, I mean. You look more like your father, but... you have her eyes. One of them, anyway."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You never spoke of her to me. You must have known... you kept the truth from me, the same as Nyx?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It's not like that. I didn't know any more than you. Besides, Lord Hades ordered all of us to never speak of her again. I thought it just a bad relationship. I didn't realize she left her son."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Something tells me Father wouldn't let her take me even if she wanted."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Maybe so. But even still, she did abandon you. Your family's here, if you ask me. But I can understand that... you need answers."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Backstory 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Than. Come join me in the lounge for old time's sake. The coast is clear. The work can wait."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You're really asking me to join you for a drink...? I mean... you know what, sure. The work can wait."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...I somehow knew, you know. I always knew you weren't going to stay. You were... so restless here. You just needed a reason to leave! And I hoped you wouldn't find one this quickly. *Eugh*. What am I saying? You have no idea."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, I know exactly what you're saying, Than. I'm sorry that I'm putting you through all of this, it's just... it's something that I have to do. But, I'm glad we know the truth about me, now. Maybe we can move on from there."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"*Tsk*... I've always lacked your optimism, Zag. Anyway... the work has waited long enough, I need to get back to it. Thanks for the drink."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...Watch yourself out there, Zagreus. I have to go."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Death 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, I've meant to ask... is it really the case that many mortals have a crippling fear of death?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It is, I'm quite feared, up there. Most of them cannot distinguish between me, and, say, Lord Ares, or your father, even. We fill them with despair. No helping it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why not? I mean, isn't it kind of a big problem that they have such negative associations, here? Can't we... I don't know, do something to educate them all?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"We've all the time to educate them, here. Their ignorance of death is solved almost as soon as they experience their first. Though I suppose they might be better off knowing before the fact."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Death 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than? I had another question about death. So... why is it mortals grieve so much about the thing, I mean... it definitely hurts there for a little while, but... it's not that bad."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"They see it as their one and only chance. Imagine if, after you perished, that was it. Back to the infinite Chaos. Everything about you. Returned to how it was before you were even there."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But that's absurd. One life? Though... *eugh*. That's horrible, even to think about."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I know, right? Some of them know that isn't how it is, and try to tell their kind about what it is we do here, but... it's slow going, getting the information out. Either way! I get to be the bearer of good news."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Death 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Than? Something's been troubling me still, with what you said, about how mortals look at death. If most of them believe their life is all they have... how do they live? I mean, I can't even imagine what that's like. I'd be a lot more careful, at the very least!"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"They live with all their hearts, or at least try. I think there's something to it, truthfully. Though, some of them, they fall apart. They get here without me. On their own, gripped with despair. If only they knew what your father always says about all this."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you mean that *'there is no escape'*? From what? The mortals are up there, not here. Not while they're technically alive in their sense, anyway."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I mean, you can't escape your problems, Zagreus. You can run from your family, but you can't run from everything. You have no choice but to confront it, and work through it, sooner or later, one way or another. You, and all of us."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"...I'm starting to notice that, yes. Though, to a mortal who has yet to die... don't they think of death as some sort of release? You come to end their misery, something like that?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I can release them from their decaying bodies. Sometimes, the Fates demand I bring them in sooner. That's about as much as I can do. Some of them get it early on, how to live. It's quite impressive, really, that they learn so quick."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Shifting 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, just how far are you able to shift, anyway, Than? I never could go more than a blade's length in front of me, while you're out there skipping across the entire world probably."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Most of it, yes. Don't beat yourself up, though, Zagreus. It's a practiced skill but I've apparently been able to do it since birth. Mother Nyx says I was a real handful."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Balcony 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, what is it you're always staring at out there, anyway, Than? I don't see anything."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"The River Styx is right in front of you, and you don't see anything, Zag? I can watch it endlessly. Studying the competition, you might say. Most mortals expect to get here by river, with Charon. Not with me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So you're locked in ruthless battle with a river, searching it for any signs of weakness, that sort of thing? That sounds stressful."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I find it rather soothing as a matter of fact. A break from having to deal constantly with mortal souls. Speaking of which... I have to pick somebody up right now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nemesis Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, my blade, the one I'm borrowing from Father anyway, it... revealed to me an older aspect of itself, of Nemesis. Nyx never mentions her. Have you two ever met?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"In case you haven't noticed, most of us who sprang from Nyx, we're not exactly close. Nemesis is fully occupied meting out justice on the surface. Our paths are not designed to cross. And based on everything I know, that's fine with me."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Eris Aspect 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"How's that Rail of Adamant been working out for you lately? Always figured the direct approach was more your style. Though, I happened to have a look at your permanent record lately, and turns out you're doing a lot of work with that thing."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Why, Thanatos, you're learning to pry in others' business! The Rail's been working out just fine, thanks. Though, now that you mention it, how well do you know Eris, one of Nyx's daughters, right? Seems she wielded the Rail before me."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"The mortals call her Strife. She and her children... it's thanks partly to their dedicated efforts I'm so busy all the time. Though, it is best we didn't speak of her, I think."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Surface 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, I ought have asked by now, but... what's it like? Up there I mean, outside. You never talk about it, I... almost forget that's where you go, for work."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What can I say? It's... different. I never stay up there for very long, don't think I could, starts making me feel ill. Too many sensations all at once. And when the chariot of Helios is in the sky, it gets so bright that I can barely see."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That sounds awful. If it's that bad, why would all the Olympians chat it up so much?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"There's no accounting for their taste, I guess. But, I'm discounting certain aspects that are not so bad. You know what? I'll not spoil the surprise. I have a feeling you're going to see for yourself soon enough."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Surface 01 B
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, I ought have asked by now, but... what's it like? Up there I mean, outside. You never talk about it, I... almost forget that's where you go, for work."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What can I say? It's... different. I never stay up there for very long, don't think I could, starts making me feel ill. Too many sensations all at once. And when the chariot of Helios is in the sky, it gets so bright that I can barely see."
|-

|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"There's no accounting for their taste, I guess."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What's going on with Charon, by the way, if you can tell me, Than? He's... never been particularly talkative, but he really seems to know the inner workings of this place."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I correspond with Charon all the time, but even I don't know the full extent of his responsibilities. He's an independent contractor of sorts, been here forever. Your father gives him plenty of space to work."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He must be compensated pretty well for having done this for so long. Tending the influx of new souls and all of that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I doubt he's in it for the compensation, Zagreus. There is no Underworld without Charon. I think he knows that, and your father knows it, too."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon 02 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, were you ever close with Charon, Than? Seems like no matter how much I try, I can't quite get through to him."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Wouldn't be surprised if you were closer to him than I am. Not all of Nyx's sons and daughters keep in steady touch. Though at least we're not always at each others' throats, like the other side of your family."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, you're not going to believe this, but... Charon's been helping me. All on his own, apparently! I was so sure that Nyx or someone put him up to it. That Skelly character I mentioned, Charon hired him!"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"What are you talking about, Zagreus? Just because Charon's selling you things doesn't mean he's helping you. Wait, are you sure?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sure! His helper, Skelly, he's a lot more talkative, and finally let on. Although, he couldn't tell me how come Charon did a thing like this, I mean... we weren't ever close..."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"*Hmm*. All I can think of is... Charon's very dedicated to this House. Like some of us. Maybe he thought... he could help settle things, between you and your father. One way or another."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Charon Fight 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Than, now hypothetically, if I were to have vanquished Charon in single combat after having, I don't know, say, helped myself to one of his wares at no charge, how long would you say he'd hold it over me?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Everything is an exchange with Charon, Zag. If there was something you refused to pay for, then I'm going to assume that's why you're back here, now. The debt is paid in obols, or in blood. Or their closest counterparts, I guess."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Skelly 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, level with me on this. You didn't happen to hire a shifty character called Skelly to assist me here and there, did you?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Who, what? No. Why would you even ask?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Persephone 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Do you remember anything else about my mother, Than? Just, anything. You weren't close, I guess?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"We weren't. She kept to herself as I recall, and I would do the same. Unlike my present company, I do not ask too many questions. It was quite clear to me she wasn't from this place."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Father isn't from this place, either. How was she any different?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Sometimes I have to be reminded that Lord Hades wasn't born here, like the rest of us. But Persephone, she... she had a radiance about her, I suppose. Reminded me of the outside, but... I don't mean that in a negative respect."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Sisyphus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, you don't hold a grudge against old Sisyphus, do you? He seems rather apprehensive about you. I understand you met not on the best of terms."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He is a brazen one, I have to give him that. I hadn't realized that you were close. Despite some questionable choices on your part, I don't think you're the poorest judge of character, and so... maybe I have him wrong."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I only have a faint impression of the man he used to be, although it seems he's changed a lot, since then. Thank you for understanding, anyway."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I heard you stayed the knave-king's sentence. I should be angry with you. Sisyphus must be the only mortal *ever *to have humiliated me. But Mother Nyx, she... must have backed you, didn't she..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"We did what needed to be done. As much as Father likes making examples out of wretched shades, an eternal sentence felt a little excessive in this case. Besides... Sisyphus isn't leaving, anyway. Seems to have found his niche."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Oh? Well, he's an odd one through and through, I guess. As long as I don't have to deal with him again."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Achilles 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You and Achilles ever get to talk much, Than?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I have my orders, he has his. What do you think? Even back when he was still alive, there was no real chance I was going to be the one to take him here, given his line of work."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Because he was a warrior. When mortals die a violent death, they're no longer your case, are they?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"No. I tend to those in less of a hurry to come here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Your trainer's been absent from his post, more so than usual. You voided his pact with Lord Hades, didn't you? I don't know how you did it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know he's more than my trainer, Than. As for how I did it, turns out being the first and only son of Hades has its privileges. Now Achilles gets to be with someone he loves. Who loves him back."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Love is common among mortals. Is theirs really so special as to be worth the trouble? Not just on your part, but theirs?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Megaera 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You've seen a lot of Megaera lately, haven't you, Zag?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's not like that, Than. She's there to slow me down. Get in my way."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"If you insist. Although I think it's much more complicated than you say."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah... her sisters are back. They're... hard to deal with. I don't think Meg is on good terms with either one."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"That's not what I meant. But fine, you've told me all I need to know, for now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Megaera 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You and Meg go back a long way, don't you? I forget sometimes you two are pretty close."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Our responsibilities must have us cross paths often, yes. But I didn't really get to know her until after the whole humiliating affair with Sisyphus."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, right. He got stuck in Tartarus after that, under Meg's personal supervision. So you bonded over your shared disdain for Sisyphus?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"We each had to blow off some steam, yes. That was some of the hardest I ever worked, back then, and her, too, I think. When you go through something like that with someone, it brings you closer, I suppose."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, there's something that I meant to tell you. Ask you, rather. You're close with Megaera, so, what I mean is... you know about *us*, right?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Yes, of course. Why do you ask?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, it's just... I figured since you deal with mortals all the time, I know that some of them, they choose a single suitor. It's a valid custom, if it's yours...!"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"The mortals have their customs, yes, indeed. Quite a variety, in point of fact. However, none as yet have stuck with me, I think. So don't concern yourself with things like that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're saying you're not angry with me? Or Meg, for that matter?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Not any more than usual. Tell her that I said hello when next you meet."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Being Close With Dusa 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, you don't take issue with me being close with Dusa, do you? She brings such warmth to this place... I really appreciate having her here."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You don't need to ask me such things, Zagreus. They're your feelings."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Ares 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, what's your relationship with Ares on Olympus? I know he deals in death himself, but... his approach seems rather different from your own."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I do not care for his approach at all. But he has been professionally courteous with me. More than I can say for most of your Olympian relatives, I suppose."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You mean the rest of the Olympians don't treat you well?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Discounting Hermes, I should say, the rest of them have nothing much to do with me at all. I can imagine why, I know it's complicated with your father here. But as for Ares... I think he's all right."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Ares 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than? I thought you ought to know that Ares, he... I think he's taken quite an interest in Nyx. Keeps asking me to talk to her on his behalf."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Finally. It's about time Olympus took notice of Mother and all her accomplishments."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Finally? You don't think Ares has untoward intentions or anything like that?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He'd be a hollow fool if he did. Why do you think they fear us on Olympus, Zagreus? Because of Hypnos? I don't think Mother Nyx requires your concern. Though, by all means, talk to her about it, if you like."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Chaos 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Mother Nyx told me you restored the Eldest Sigil, Zagreus. I couldn't believe that was your doing. What you did... it meant a lot to her."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It was my pleasure. Say, did Nyx ever let on to you of her relationship with Chaos, at any point?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"No, not everyone is quite as sharing as you are, Zag. Nor as inclined to pry. But still... in this case, sounds like it worked out. So, thank you. If she hasn't said as much."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 01
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I can tell when Mother Nyx is upset, Zagreus. And I know better than to ask her, so I'm going to ask you. What happened?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Probably because Nyx took issue with me chatting with Dusa from time to time. Is that really so unbecoming of me? Not even Father seems to care."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Well, Mother cares! And I, for one, know better than to question it. None of us would be here were it not for her. If she has a request for you, you honor it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're telling me I should just start ignoring Dusa from now on, like you do?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You're a god. I'm telling you to learn to act like one."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sorry I raised my voice with you last time, Than. I know Nyx puts so much into this place, and has nurtured so many of us here."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It's not me you should be apologizing to, Zag. Although, with Mother Nyx, sometimes it's best to leave her be. As for Dusa... I didn't mean to suggest you should abandon your friend."

|"Nyx let her go, Than. Dusa, I mean, she's gone. What do I do?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"If I were you, I would start getting over it as soon as possible. But, I don't see you doing that. Just remember... maybe this isn't about you. Dusa's job may have been far too much for her. Mother Nyx is strict, but she is fair."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Then she should give Dusa another chance. Has Meg heard? She'll be furious."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Megaera will be no such thing. Some of us don't default to questioning every decision from our superiors."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 04
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I saw that Dusa's back. You must have worked your ways on Mother Nyx. Don't know how you do it. Can't remember the last time I saw her budge on anything."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx genuinely cares about this House and all of us. She had to come around on something like this. Dusa's one of the hardest workers here. Even if she has room to improve."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Incessant hard work can lead to trouble, Zagreus. I think maybe that's why Mother was concerned. We all know how your father can get. She doesn't need someone like Dusa taking after him."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Than, you know, Hypnos, he adores you. Besides just driving you to madness, now and then."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I'm rather used to the relationship, thanks, Zagreus. Seems like you got to know him pretty well."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, dying repeatedly can end up bringing people closer, I suppose."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I don't know what's worse, dying repeatedly or Hypnos. Although, I guess I'm grateful for your patience with him, Zag."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Hypnos 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Got to tell you something, Than. You can be pretty mean to Hypnos! And that's coming from someone who's mean to Hypnos a lot. Believe me, I completely understand, but... still."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He's utterly incompetent, Zag. He wouldn't even be here if Mother Nyx wasn't trying to whip him into some sort of shape."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah, but... pretty much none of this would be here, were it not for Nyx, right? Anyway my point is not that you should go easy on him, but... there must be some way not to get as frustrated. You'll both be better off."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I know, it's just...! You're right. I catch myself feeling particularly horrid after talking to him. He can be very frustrating, and self-absorbed... though, I know he means well. Probably."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Hypnos 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I can hardly believe it. Hypnos finally came out on top, huh? Even Father seemed pleased with him. That's more than I get."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I can hardly believe it either, Zagreus. But then again, he's one of Mother Nyx's offspring, so we shouldn't be so surprised. Though, I have to thank you for talking to me about him a while back..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, that? I noticed you two getting along better recently. So what's your secret?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"He loves lists. Doesn't do well with subtlety, so much, but spell things out for him, and he will get right on it. Long as he's awake, at least. He's still working on that part."

|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I saw you voided the old pact between Orpheus and your father. So now he gets to see his wife from time to time?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He does, and I did, Than. I think we can stand to see a little less of him if it means he can be happier for the remainder of eternity."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You really need to learn to stop meddling in others' affairs. Did either of them even ask your help? I can't imagine Orpheus did, and I'm guessing his wife's feelings were complicated, too, from what I know of the circumstances of their final meeting."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What? Orpheus is my mate, Than. And I came to know his muse, Eurydice, as well. They still had feelings for each other, but with no way to communicate."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"So you decided to step in. *Tsch*. I think my instincts on the subject are just not the same as yours. I know your intentions were in the right place, but... you know what, forget it."

|"I saw the Fated List of Minor Prophecies was requisitioned through the House Contractor, Zagreus. Didn't take you for an agent of the Fates."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Turns out I'm full of surprises, Thanatos. Though, the Three Fates are your sisters, aren't they? Surprised you didn't requisition the List yourself."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Guess it just wasn't meant to be. Though, I don't know them at all. Keep only to themselves, somewhere. Sometimes I wonder whether everything really is preordained, or whether they're making all this up as they go."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Seemed only fair in the grand scheme of things. He slew his own parents at some point, right? I think the Fates enjoy this sort of thing."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Come on, Zag, take some credit where it's due. Though... you'll forgive me if I keep my distance for a little while, as I think you have some issues to resolve. You watch yourself."

|"I am. I figured it's the only way I could continue interrupting you while you try to do your job. You work too hard, Than, live a little, right?"
|-

|"*Heh*. Well then, I'll see what I can do about that. You'll have to show me what you mean by *'live a little'*, though."
|-

|-

|"Have to tell you something, Than. My birthmother... she didn't abandon me. Or at least... she didn't think she did."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"She didn't *think *she did? What are you talking about, Zag? She left when you were born. Was never seen or spoken of again, until all this with you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, it turns out... she never knew I was alive, at all. Complications when I was born. She had been struggling already here, and it was all too much, I guess. By the time Nyx brought me back... my mother was long gone."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"*What*? But, Mother Nyx, and your father, they... could have sent for her, let her know... they must have known where she went!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nyx knew. But, Father must have convinced her that my mother... that it would be for the best if she never found out. About me. So she could live in peace. Away from all of this. And away from Olympus."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"That's... a lot to take in."
|-

|-

|"I'm sometimes at a loss myself, Thanatos. Though one thing I know is it's always really good running into you out there, it's... well, exciting. Sparring with you and all that! And then, I know it means that I might get to see you here."
|-

|-

|"You know I don't have time to list all your infuriating habits, Zagreus. Though... if any of them were outside my usual tolerance threshold, I promise to let you know, all right?"
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos About Relationship 03
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...It just struck me how much you've changed, Zag. I still remember when you kept trying to singe Cerberus' tail with your feet. Haven't seen you do that in a while."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, I definitely learned my lesson there. But, thanks, I guess. You've opened up a lot, yourself, by the way. Talking to you lately, it's a world apart from the first time. You looked like you were going to slice my head off."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"It sure must have taken a lot of courage for you to come right up and tell me you thought I looked better before I cut my hair. I still ask myself how come I didn't keep ignoring you after that. Or slice your head off."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, the option is always available, I guess. Hey, you ever think of growing it out again?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"No. It kept getting in my way. Sliced it right off and never looked back. So... plenty of personal growth all around, then?"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you for asking, Than. I don't know how much more I can say right now, given everything. I'm still figuring it out myself. I'm thankful you've been there to help me get to see her from time to time."
|-

|"So, between us... all your attempting to break out of here, over and over... you're now authorized to keep that up? Exposing weaknesses in Underworld security, huh."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Something like that. I guess I've gotten pretty decent about escaping from a place that's known for being inescapable. Lets me keep in touch with the other side of the family. Work with you from time to time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I have to say I never thought I'd hear you talking about looking forward to working, Zag. You feeling all right? Spending too much time on the surface, maybe?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh I'm feeling fine. I never thought I was much good at anything, but... if my fated purpose is to be a master of frustrating Father's efforts to make everything strictly perfect, I think I'm OK with that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Well, then, I'll be looking forward to working with you in a more official capacity. Even if we're still supposed to keep it all under wraps, for sake of appearances. See you out there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Post Ending 02
|-

|"Have to tell you, Zag. It's different, with your mother around here. Don't mean to be so obvious, but... it's something about your father, I suppose."
|-

|-

|-

|"My lord, he and I... please. Go lock me up in Tartarus, or deal whichever justice you see fit, but... my loyalty is not subject to change. And I cannot stand by and watch you fight. The matter between you and Zagreus... there has to be some resolution, here."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"You dare to lecture me? *Tsch*. My loyal subjects are too few of late, I think. This is *your *realm, not mine; I'll not cast you into that wretched pit. It's not like I have someone to replace you here, besides. Now then, begone."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I mean, you're still trying just as hard as ever to prevent me from escaping past the threshold of your realm, so, I don't know if I'd exactly call the matter *settled*. But... it does feel different, now."
|-
|'''Hades'''
|"And so you see... I would continue in our mutual good graces, if you please. This House can only function if the upper management is in accord. What do you say?"
|-

|"I say, you honor me, my lord. I appreciate you telling me, yourself. And I concur that, for the good of all the Underworld, it is imperative that each of us continue to perform at our full strength."

|"Don't you know it, I was just about to get to that! Then you showed up, and I got so distracted, it just kind of slipped my mind! It happens, right?"
|-

|"You need to focus, Brother. Or it'll be Lord Hades reprimanding you again, and that is not something you want."
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, I don't know about that, last time I talked to Master he made *pretty clear *he never wanted to speak to me again!"
|-

|-

|"...Well, how often do you consult these lists you make? If you're spending too much time just making lists, you're not leaving time to get anything done."
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, I *love *making my lists... I always illustrate the edges, each one is *unique*! That way anyone who gets to review the work, it's a whole *experience*, you know? But... I guess it does take up a lot of time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You'll have to work around the constraints of your responsibilities. You do take breaks, don't you? Before and after each break, maybe that's a time to make sure your own list of priorities is up-to-date."
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Wait, my own list of priorities...? But, you're saying I can just go and make a list... for me? Huh. Whoa. *Whoa*...."

|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, *haha*, no, he doesn't help. It's just I took to listing only the important stuff up top, and spending just a bit more time on the priority reports, and... guess it's working out!"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Look, whatever the case... the work's improved. It's been observed. You ought to keep it up."
|-

|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Aww, come on, Thanatos, are you kidding me, right here? We're like two skeletons in a crypt! You're the best, and you're always looking out for me. Even when you're not around for what can seem like aeons at a time!"
|-

|-

|-

|"It is through a concerted effort that the House thus thrives, for now. Though, it shall do so only through continued diligence on your behalf, and that of many others here. It is a good occasion to take brief reprieve. But we need you working to the best of your ability, here, Thanatos."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''

|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 07 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Than. For all the times you've bailed me out, and just, all the times you've been around for me... I thought I'd get you this. The real thing."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Ambrosia...! Zagreus, where did you even... don't you think this is a bit excessive?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You say that like it's a bad thing. Little bit of excess from time to time never hurt anyone I'm sure."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"*Oh*, you would be surprised. Though if you're going to embarrass me, you know what, I am going to reciprocate. *Behold*!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 08
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"For you, Thanatos. The Olympians might be accustomed to this stuff but I think we should have our share of it down here. At least you should."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You know... the Olympians do have good taste in certain things. The last bottle you gave me... it was... better than expected. Though, I almost decided not to try it at all."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But try it you did! And now, you'll get to try this one for comparison's sake. Each one's supposed to be different you know."
|-

|"Different, huh. Well, then, I guess I'll have to see what you mean by that. Thank you, Zag. You didn't have to do this."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 09
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I hope you're ready for some more of the real thing, there, Than, because I got you some, and I won't be taking *'Tsch, what is this, Zag' *for an answer."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Ugh, what is this? Come on, already, Zagreus, are you just messing with me, now? How did you even manage to get more of this, much less decide to hand it off to me?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"In order: no, I'm not; by ransacking my father's realm repeatedly; and it's because I like you, Thanatos. In case you still have some misgivings about that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"You *like *me, Zagreus...? I never thought, I... don't know why that sounds so strange, coming from you. Given everything that's happened as of late."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah. Look, if you don't feel the same way about me at this point, I would rather know. Cease all these coy gift exchanges, and all that."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I never said anything like that! You know what, there's... a bunch of mortals I have to go fetch. Good-bye."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 10
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanatos, I wanted to apologize for the last time I approached you with a bottle of the real thing, and give the whole exchange another shot. Would that be all right?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"*Hmph*! You're asking my consent to give me yet another lavish gift? Sure! Permission granted. Though, what makes you think that your approach this time is going to be any more successful than the last?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know that it will. I never really know exactly where I stand with you. But I know how I feel. And I'd rather be up front with you, even if it means risking our relationship, such as it is."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Our relationship? It wasn't long ago you were prepared to throw it all away while making for the surface, if you don't recall. But now you're saying that you care for me, and... what, exactly, Zagreus?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes, that's what I'm saying, Than. I should not have left the way I did, without letting you know. But when you found me, I... think that's when... that's when I knew. Or started to realize, you know?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I... yes. I know, I think, because... when I heard you took off, the anger that I felt, it was... it wasn't something I expected. So... *ungh*. What do we do now?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Maybe we ought to take our time? Unlike the real thing there, that's a commodity we have in good supply. Just know that, if you feel the way I do... you know where to find me. And if not... I'm grateful, anyway."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"...I see. Well, then. The best that I can say for now is that... I'm grateful, too, for this. Take care of yourself, Zag."
|-
! colspan="2" |Thanatos Gift 07
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I have to hand it to you, Zag, you're really putting in the work to get me to forgive you after all you've done. I'm honestly surprised."

|-

|"About when we last spoke. I care about you, Thanatos. A lot. Though, you asked what you are to me... how am I supposed to even answer that?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"*Ugh*, I don't know. Sometimes I miss not feeling anything. Can't always trust what feelings say. I get to thinking, are we only friends, or... look, this is embarrassing."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"To think discussing feelings would be even harder than annihilating Father's forces. But... I've been asking myself the same thing, Than. If it's any reassurance."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Well, if you come up with any answers, I guess let me know. Good running into you."

|'''Thanatos'''
|"Hey. I didn't mean to lay the guilt on you for what you did for Orpheus, Zag. I just worry when we get involved... we can make matters worse."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You haven't ever made anything worse, Than. But as for me, I realized what you meant. I was so eager to do something for Orpheus when I first met Eurydice, I... never asked them if it was OK."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"At least things turned out well for them. But that was fortunate. Family troubles, personal relations, and the like... it's sensitive business. Though, who am I to talk. You didn't ask me to show up, like this."

|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Than, are you OK? I mean, with everything, lately?"
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I am. Though, thanks for asking, Zag. The risk of being close with anyone is sometimes things get complicated, fast. Admittedly it's not a risk I often take, but... in your case, it's been worth it, all in all. We're good, all right?"

|"What are you doing back here, Zag? You made it out."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I did... but I had to come back. And, not exactly voluntarily. I'll be visiting up there from time to time, though... it looks like I'll be staying here."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"Visiting from time to time...? I don't understand."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's my mother. She's alive and well! It's just that I can't stay with her up there for very long! So we'll have to catch up... one visit at a time."
|-
|'''Thanatos'''
|"I see. Well then... that's good. That's good, because... it means that I won't have to track you down up top. Because, between us, I can only take so much of it up there."
