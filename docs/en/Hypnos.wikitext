! colspan="2" |Hypnos First Meeting
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Welcome to the House of Hades, where... wait, I know *you*! Guess that means you died out there, huh? Well don't be sad, though, pretty much everybody dies sometime!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Misc Meeting 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh! Hi. I'd ask you how it went, but since you're here again, I guess I know already, huh! Oh well, just come on in!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Misc Meeting 02
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Ah, good, you're back already, huh? A few of us, we had a bet, about how long you'd last out there, and I just *knew *you'd be back in *no time*!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Misc Meeting 03
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, hi! *Um*, welcome home! Again! Go right ahead! I think your dad's mad about something or other, though."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Misc Meeting 04
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Wow, you've died at least *five times *so far, I think? Dying's good for the whole ecosystem down here, so, uh, thanks! You're helping make the Underworld a better place!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Great! Just keep dying over and over and everything will be fine."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Misc Meeting 05
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"It's fun watching the Pool of Styx, you know? The ripples in the blood, and everything, and sometimes, somebody pops out of there, like you! House staff and guests of honor, no one else. I sign them in, and help make sure they have a pleasant stay!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Misc Meeting 06
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Ooh*, why you made it all the way to Asphodel that time, that's pretty neat! Still died and everything but not as quickly as you used to, so, that's progress, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Run Progress 01 A
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, wow, you did it! According to my list it says here you've died, what, fifty times *at least*! That's more than anybody's died around here, I think!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Run Progress 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, let me be the first to say: *Congratulations*! You have died a hundred times since I've been keeping score. Since I've been keeping track. No prize for it or anything, but the journey is its own reward, or something, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Run Progress 02
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"You're not going to believe this, here, you ready? Three.. hundred... *times*!! That's right! Three hundred times, you've died! That's like... more than an entire village from an earthquake, all on your own!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Run Progress 03
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, I just can't believe it, although I know my list here never lies! And it says that you have died all of five *hundred *times! *Five hundred*!! I can't even think of a number higher than that!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Meg Defeated 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"It's usually pretty quiet, keeping watch over the Pool of Styx back there. But it's sure been busy lately! Why, somebody else came through just earlier! You should have seen the look on my face when it wasn't you!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos About Thanatos 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, you keep dying! You happen to run into my brother anywhere out there, by any chance? Haven't seen him in ages, what's with the long assignment?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Something about a war. Father sent Thanatos to take stock, but you're right, it's been a while now that you mention it. I guess a lot's occurred down here since then."
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"I'll say! The lounge re-opened, let's see, what else... Anyway! You see my brother out there you tell him we've got everything here under control!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos About Thanatos 02
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, did you see? My brother, he's come back! He's here! Somewhere, I think! Good old Thanatos. He's so busy all the time, he... never talks to me! Kind of like your dad with *you*, I guess!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos About Thanatos 03
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Whaa*! Oh, hah, you just startled me there, is all, I was just... um... I..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, uh, everything all right, there, Hypnos?"
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, absolutely! Everything *definitely *is. It's just... it's Thanatos. He said some stuff, and... now I'm not so sure I'm doing the best job I can, you know?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sure he wasn't trying to hurt your feelings. Wait, what am I saying, he's always been harsh with you, hasn't he?"
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, what if he doesn't like me anymore? He's got other brothers!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos About Thanatos 04
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh hey! Um, this might be a little weird, but I, *uh*... thanks! I mean, you talked to Thanatos about me, right? At first I thought he was acting funny. But he has definitely been a lot nicer to me, lately!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Come on, Hypnos, I didn't have anything to do with that. You seem like you've been working extra hard, and taking some of the feedback you've been getting to heart. I think Thanatos really appreciates that sort of thing. Who doesn't?"
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"I don't know! But I really appreciate that you went out of your way, I mean... I just stand here and greet and register the dead! But you? You're a real friend!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos About Thanatos Relationship 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, there you are! So is it true?! You know, about you and Thanatos? Because he told me, and I just said, *whooooaaa*, but then, everything made sense?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm sure whatever it is he said is completely true, yes, Hypnos."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos About Sleeper Seat 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, did you see? Somebody got me this incredible new sleeper-seat right here! Though, I would never lie down while on the job! I'm perfectly all right sleeping while standing up!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Post Flashback 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Hypnos? What would it take for you to let me through the locked door down the hall?"
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, *hahaha*, that's a good one, you know I can't let you enter your dad's private chambers anymore, since you betrayed his trust and tried to run away from home! Sorry, Master's orders!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Post Ending 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, did you see?! The Queen's come back! Though, did she ever take her sweet time!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey watch it, Hypnos, that's my mother you're talking about!"
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"What, really? *Huh*! So then *your *mom doesn't spend any time with you, either! We've got something in common!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Post Ending 02
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Wait, wait, wait, so what's all this about you *working *here? I thought they fired you, and that was why you left!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hypnos... you think all these times I've died, it's because I was upset I was let go from a miserable job?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"I heard the feast you had here, it was really something else! All the gods, together in one place, eating, drinking, not killing one another! That must have been a sight."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You should have been there, Hypnos! Not that I noticed your absence, though, what happened? Other pressing business?"
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Slept through the whole thing!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Autograph 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Hypnos? This is for all the well-meaning advice you've given me. A little something from a certain double-bladed-axe-wielding, bull-headed, oversized monster of a man who you admire?"
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"What's this, it's kind of hard to read the hand-writing, it says, no way... *To Hypnos, my biggest fan. Stay vigilant. Asterius. *There's... even a little picture of a bull. You... I... wow... *wow*!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Hoh*, says here one of the Wretched Thugs got you, too bad! They're slow but they hit pretty hard I guess. Have you tried moving out of the way?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 01 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"According to my list here, why, you must've just got clobbered all the way back home by one of those Wretched Thugs again! The old moving-out-the-way trick didn't work, huh...?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 02
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Looks like one of the Wretched Witches shot you dead last time, sorry to hear that, huh? Have you tried shooting them first?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 02 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"You must have had a run-in with a Spreader, huh! They're much more talented than the low-grade witches down in Tartarus, so your dad lets them stay warm up in Asphodel, I guess!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 02 C
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Oof*, a Splitter zapped you, didn't she! There's lots of witches in your dad's place, huh? Witchcraft must be pretty dangerous for all those mortals up there. Pretty dangerous for you, too!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 03
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Aw*, looks like you died from one of those nasty booby traps left by a Wretched Pest, little guys who look like urns? Have you tried avoiding them maybe?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 04
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Ooh wow*, so Megaera herself got you last time, that must have been intense! She's fast, and strong, and beautiful, and... um... anyway, I hope the Fates are nicer to you next time!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 04 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Hah*! Megaera the Fury got you again! She is unstoppable, isn't she? One time, I tried to stop her on the way to have a chat with your dad, and she didn't even turn her head! *<Sigh...>"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 04 C
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"You got *whipped *by Megaera the Fury! *Eh*?! I always wanted to say that. Whipped, you know? Referring both to how badly you lost, and to that glowy purple whip she's always threatening me with whenever I try to talk to her?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 05
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"So you got skewered by a Spike Trap out there, huh? Well, that's too bad! Have you tried not standing there, like, when the spikes come out?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 06
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Ooh *looks like one of those Dart Traps killed you last time, bet *that *must have hurt! Have you tried getting behind something?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 07
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Ow *looks like you got blasted to bits by an explosive urn last time! We keep some really nasty shades all bottled up in those, but... you so much as touch them, *BOOM*! Hah!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 08
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Whoaaa*, you just got killed by one of those Bloodless Inferno Bomber skeleton type guys, nice! I always wondered what would happen if you just kind of stood around while all their bombs went off!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 09
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Owie*, looks like the Bone Hydra of Asphodel just stomped you that time, huh? I hear each of its heads has its own nasty tricks. That must be tough!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 09 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Bone Hydra got you again, huh? Real sorry about that. Though, you know what? I want you to get back out there, you know, all through Tartarus, and Asphodel, again, and knock some sense into it for me, OK? OK!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 09 C
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Wait let me guess, don't tell me... you got slaughtered by the Bone Hydra, again! How many times was that? But you will get 'em next time, I just know it! Maybe the time after that. Eventually, no doubt about it!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 10
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Daw*, one of those Wretched Louts just killed you dead that time, those mean old slappy guys? Maybe try killing them beforehand, I don't know!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 10 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Ooh*, says here a Wretched Lout slapped you to death again, that's a tough break! Have you tried talking it out, or something, I... I don't know?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 11
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey you got turned to ashes by those floating Brimstone crystally type things! Next time one's turning you to charcoal with those beams of theirs, how about you step on over to the side?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 14
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Ooh*, ow, so you got burned down to a crisp out there, standing in magma, right? I know you've got your burning feet and all, but standing in magma, why, I'm not so sure that's a good idea!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 15
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Huh*, so you walked straight into a burning magma spout, is that what got you this time? Bet if you waited long enough it'd cool off, instead of killing you!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 16
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Hooh*, looks like one of those little Numbskulls took a big old bite right out of you back there, I guess they got you, huh? Maybe if you weren't quite so tasty, they'd leave you alone! And so would I!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 16 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Did you just get chomped by one of those little Numbskulls, again?! Oh, that is definitely rough. I guess you must have done something to make the Fates real mad!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 16 C
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Oh, hohoh, *you got blown up by a Slam-Dancer, I can see it on your face! It also says it on my list! Got everybody's cause of death, right here. Some real morbid stuff from time to time! So anyway, take care!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 17
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Why you look like someone who just got beaten silly by a dirty skeleton! Beaten well beyond the brink of death, I ought to say! And, sure enough, according to my list, you did! Those Bloodless sure are tough!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 18
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"My list here says that you got petrified to death that time by some sort of nasty floating gorgon head? No offense to Dusa! Sounds like a pretty painful way to go, though hey! At least you got to be a statue for a little while! I like statues."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 19
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Pff*, can I just say *ouch*? Because according to the list here, you got flattened like a pancake by a Skull-Crusher, out in Asphodel somewhere! Keep that up and you're going to get even shorter, *haha*!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Hit And Run Unit
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Mmm*, you look like someone who just got turned to stone then crushed to a bloody pulp by the Megagorgon of Asphodel, am I right? Well, look, I'm sorry to hear that, and before you ask, I won't tell Dusa, don't you worry about that!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 20
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Oh*, I recognize that look! That is the look of someone who just got here after having met a most unfortunate demise, courtesy of the notorious Bloodless Wave-Makers!! How do they make those waves, and why do they hurt so, *so *much? Plenty of time to think it over, now!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 21
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Looks like you *really *took the heat from one of those Bloodless Burn-Flingers back there, didn't you? I know how tempting it can be to try and catch those fiery explosive bombs they throw, but... if I might offer you a bit of personal advice? You really shouldn't do that."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 22
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, *wow*, Alecto's got it out for you...? Normally she doesn't kill anyone, she likes keeping them alive... for quite a while, really. Hurts them still, but doesn't kill them off! I guess she really doesn't like you, huh!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Tisiphone 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"If you got killed by Tisiphone the Fury, why, then it must mean you've been accused of *murder*! A most heinous crime, as I'm to understand! Well, I hope you clear your name. Or whatever those mortals do about that stuff!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Shade Sword 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"So, you lost a duel to the death with an Exalted Brightsword, did you? They're pretty much the best of the best, so don't feel bad! It had to happen! But if it's any consolation, it'll probably happen again!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 24
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Says here that you got stuck like a piece of meat on a spit by an Exalted Longspear, *wow*, I'll bet that really hurt! Too bad you don't have a thick, leathery hide or something that could help protect you in that type of situation. Oh well!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 25
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Looks like you just got pounded down by an Exalted Greatshield, huh? Did you try attacking while their guard was down? Or, did they just not let down their guard at any point... *Oh*..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 26
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Let me guess, you got caught out by one of those Exalted Strongbows, did you there? Next time, if you don't stand around like you're doing here right now, maybe you won't make such an easy target!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 27
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"My understanding is you had a little run-in with a Nemean Chariot, just kind of plowed right into you, there, didn't it? You got to watch where you're going crossing the streets of Elysium next time!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 28
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Those Archer Statues in Elysium have got to be a real sight, no doubt about it. But, you can't just stand there and admire them, or else they'll shoot you dead like they did just now!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 29
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Sounds to me like you got *stuck *in more ways than one gawking at a Phalanx Statue in Elysium back there! I got to hand it to your dad. He made sure those look just as good as they stab any intruders like yourself!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 30
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Says here that you got flash-fried to a crisp within a Phoenix Urn's destructive blast back there, I mean, you really ought to stay away from those, if you ask me!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 31
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Woow*, I can't believe you took on the Minotaur, no way! No wonder you're back here! Everyone knows that he's unstoppable. Especially me! Hey, next you run into him, could you... get his autograph, for me?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 31 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"The Minotaur killed you again, that must have been exciting, huh? *So*, any chance you got that autograph for me, before you got destroyed?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 31 C
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Slain by the Minotaur once more, now he's a real beast, there, isn't he! But, tell me something, any progress on that autograph request of mine?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 32
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, I just knew that you'd be back, soon as I heard you faced the Champion of Elysium, himself! You know, I've heard that, among mortals, it's an honor to be killed by somebody like Theseus! Keep it up, and maybe you'll be famous, too!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 32 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Look, I have to say, I just don't think you have a real chance against both Theseus and the Minotaur, together! But, you might just have a chance to get the Minotaur's autograph for me, if maybe you ask nice or something?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 32 C
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Good, you're back! So, prior to when Theseus killed you again back there, did you, by any chance, happen to ask his big bull buddy for an autograph for me, this time?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 33
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Looks like somebody just found out that some types of butterflies are incredibly dangerous! Especially the ones that come swarming out of those Soul Catchers! If only you could just... not have a soul, or something? Then they'd bother somebody else!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 34
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"So, one of those Flame Wheels drove right into you, and burst into a fiery explosion, killing both of you, is that what happened there? Well if it makes you feel any better, *technically*, I think this means you got your revenge!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 35
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"You had a run-in with those nasty Satyrs all the way up in the Temple of Styx, huh. I can't even imagine the sheer agony, having their lethal poison coursing through my body!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 36
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"You know, I've only heard the tales of the gigantic, vicious, flesh-eating vermin up there near the surface. Now I guess we both know that those tales are definitely true!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 37
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Eugh*, it says here you got chewed up by an angry swarm of Crawlers somewhere just a stone's throw from the exit to your dad's domain? Talk about adding insult to injury, huh?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 38
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Oh, I heard the pests of Tartarus had bigger, meaner counterparts up near the surface, but... I guess you just found out the hard way, huh? When you tripped one of their explosive things?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 39
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"I know that look, why, that's the look of someone just incinerated by a Snakestone, am I right? They spit a whole bunch of those white-hot, flesh-burning beams right at the same time, there, don't they?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 40
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, you're back! Wait, wait, what happened? My list says you got killed by a *Redacted*, what's that even mean? I've never seen anything like this!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 40 B
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Redacteds got you again, huh. Here's the thing, I keep asking around about them and no one seems to know what I'm talking about! Could you maybe describe them for me, please?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 40 C
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Huh*, that's funny. Nothing on my list at all this time, except... I could have sworn I saw you walk right out of the Pool back there. I'll have to have this thing looked at."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 41
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"The list is telling me you caught one of those gigantic Temple saw blades square in the chest, huh? *Eugh*... At least you're back in one piece!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation 42
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"What's the matter, there, you got a *splitting *headache from those giant falling axes in the Temple of Styx? Well I have just the cure, which is: Don't get hit by them!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Poison Trap
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Well *somebody *just walked into a cloud of noxious gas, there, huh! Must have lost all your vital functions pretty quickly after that! Next time, you'll know it's seriously deadly stuff, because it killed you! And because it's green!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Biome Timer
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"So, you just plain ran out of time and died, all according to the Pact of Punishment, there, huh? Now that is what I call a *dead*line, *hahahaha*!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Gun Grenade Drop Trait
|-
|'''Hypnos'''

|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Mini Boss Crawler 01
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Died Early 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Wait, *what*, you're back *already*? Hey, my list says that you barely made it out of here before you died! Were you even trying? Because if you were, why, maybe you need to try a whole lot *harder *than that next time!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Wringer 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"*Oh*, you got throttled by a Wringer, must have grabbed and crushed you like a grape! You know what grapes are, right? They're like big, squishy pomegranate seeds."
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Heavy Ranged Splitter 01
|-

|"*Ah*, looks like you ran smack into the Doomstone out in Tartarus, thing gives me the creeps! Next time, try standing perfectly still. That way, it'll all be over that much faster!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Wretch Assassin 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"Hey, you're the latest victim of a Wretched Sneak, that's something, right? They like to get you when you least expect it, so next time, why not keep spinning around and around? Then you'll catch them trying to sneak up!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Ranged Burrower 01
|-
|'''Hypnos'''
|"So, let me guess, one minute you were minding your own business out in Asphodel, and then the next, one of those Dracons pops up right in front of you and *pfeh*! Just kills you dead with noxious acid breath. *Ah*, well! It happens, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Hypnos Consolation Bloodless Berserker 01
|-

|"*Wow*, you just barged into the Witches Circle out in Asphodel, and they just filled you full of all those stinging purple orbs and killed you, huh? You can't just show up expecting to join their club! You have to study witchcraft for *years*!"

|-

|"I asked you how you did it, got the traffic flow moving a little faster, and... it's the sarcophagus things, isn't it? Right down the hall! The shades, they're scared to stand around! That's brilliant, Mister Hypnos, I'm impressed!"
