|'''Theseus'''
|"...I'm telling you, you're ''wrong'', Asterius! He is no ''royalty'', most certainly not any ''I ''would recognize! He's but a nameless, long-forgotten minor god born of the depths, and bound to stay in them!"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I, too, once was berated by such words, king. We've faced this enemy how many times? And in my estimation, he's fought bravely, here."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Bravely''?! Hiding behind those pillars is what you call ''bravely'', Asterius? We shall have to discuss this strange lapse of judgment after we achieve our victory!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"I hope you're perfectly pleased with yourself, hellspawn. Because Asterius has been quite cross with me! Such as he is. He says I have misjudged the likes of you! ''Outrageousness''."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"You don't hear me, king. We still have a lot to learn about this foe. Each time, he's differently equipped. Weapons, god-given abilities, and such. Despite our efforts... it's been difficult to read his strategies."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"And now, you're saying I can't fight, Asterius? Even though I had no difficulty besting ''you ''within that maze of yours?! Come on, let's do this fight!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Well, worm! Come fight us, I suppose. And take fullest advantage of the havoc that you sowed! We are no team! We're merely two combatants, simultaneously booked to be here, now."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"King, I think you are over-reacting, here. Try to be reasonable. And be more considerate about my point of view. Don't think I am asking for too much."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"You're asking the impossible of me! But, let us fight. And let us lose, I'm sure, because if we are not a team, what are we, then, Asterius...?"
|-

|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"You'll have to excuse the Champion, there, short one. He hasn't been himself. Though he'll still fight you to the death, I'm sure."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's good, because you had me worried for a moment, there. Hey maybe I can knock some sense back into him, what do you think?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I'm not so sure. I've tried. But I know better than to underestimate you. Fight us, then."
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Please fight with me, again, Asterius. I mean, just like before! You must forgive me my indecencies of late. This blasted fiend! His lies and treachery get right under my skin. Or the phantasmagorical equivalent!"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Swear something to me, king. That you'll discard your fears about our bond. The short one here is never going to break it. He doesn't even understand it. The only one who can break it is you, yourself."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"I... oh, my dear friend, Asterius. I see, of course, you're right, you're right. ''You're right''! And I solemnly do swear to you, indeed, that I shall never again doubt our brotherhood! Nor shall I ever listen to this fiend! Together, now and always!!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Pact Reverted 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Well now, Asterius, he's returned! And this time, we shall have to vanquish him without the aid of our divine armor! A worthy challenge, no?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Be cautious not to underestimate him, king. He has proved troublesome before."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Nonsense, my friend! For how can one underestimate that which deserves no esteem whatsoever?! Together, now, ''attack''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus With Asterius 01
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"He's here, king. Activating armor. It's fortunate repairs on your chariot were completed in time."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Nonsense, my friend! We could defeat this vile hellspawn with or without the additional divine protection we've been granted here! Get him!"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Theseus?! The Bull of Minos?! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!"

|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"What are those bestial gloves of yours, blackguard? Beginning to show more of your true and savage nature, here perhaps?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"No. He bears the Twin Fists in the aspect of a king called Gilgamesh. That king, he, too, wrestled a beastlike man, who then became a friend. Maybe that's why I knew this fight would come."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"What are you telling me, Asterius? Now is certainly not a good time for waxing philosophical, I think! And, surely this King Gilgamesh of whom you speak is much more competent a fighter than ''this ''filth!"
|-

|-

|"We're well-equipped to deal with you, short one. Though I know better than to disregard your might."
|-

|"Speak for yourself, Asterius! I, for one, know only pure contempt for this foul daemon and his underhanded fighting style! A style we shall easily dismantle, now!"
|-

|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"What hope have you, monster, versus the blessed bonds of brotherhood?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Best not belittle him, king. He is more powerful than he appears. We must remain alert, this time."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Oh, I am perfectly alert right now, Asterius! And were I still alive, I would be positively salivating at the thought of running through this pustule with my spear, or whichever means I had available! Now, ''let's go''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus With Asterius 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Theseus, before you flap your ghostly gums at me again, I'd like to hear from good Asterius this time! He almost never gets a word in, thanks to you."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"The king speaks for the both of us, short one. Though if you wish to hear me say something to you, I will oblige."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"And I, too, shall oblige! That is, oblige my trusty spear, which yearns to penetrate your soft and vulnerable, altogether pallid flesh! Now, die!"
|-

|-

|"King. The princess Ariadne was my sister, if you don't recall. Please do not denigrate her memory. ''<Snort> ''You're making me upset."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Ah'', no, my friend! I meant you no offense! But I'd no love for her, was that my fault?! ''Pff'', forgive me. I... I shall seek her out. Someday or night. But first!! This daemon ''has ''to be destroyed. Together, no?!"

|"My father is to thank for that, not me. I've proven difficult for him to contain, so now I'm beneficiary of his latest Pact of Punishment. You're welcome!"
|-

|-

|"Tell me, short one, where is your own armored suit? I would prefer not to do battle against one who's ill equipped."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, my father keeps the dress code very strict down there in Tartarus. No armor in the House! Never tried the stuff."
|-

|"Dress code. ''<Snort> ''I, too, follow a code. And it's a code that strictly states I cannot let you pass without a fight."

|-

|"Fine change of pace, Asterius! Who needs that old, spectacular, custom-fitting suit of legendary armor, anyway?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"You mock me. Yet you know nothing of being trapped; enclosed in something and unable to break free. I need no armor to fight you."

|-

|"Just been a little tied up lately is all, but I will get to it, Asterius! I guess you'll want to know the result?"
|-

|"Yes. Here, I'll give you this chance to get home quickly, if you want to know, yourself."
|-

|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"There, on your hands... the weapons you call Malphon. They're just as I saw in my dream. Monstrous. Like me."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Former property of someone called Gilgamesh. The beast-man he fought, Enkidu... you said they became friends? What said your dream about us on that front, sir?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"It didn't say much. Only that we would fight. Just as that Gilgamesh and Enkidu once did. Maybe the outcome will be the same, maybe it won't. We'll find out."

|"Agreed on both counts! Just passing through, so if you'll excuse me..."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I will not. ''<Snort> ''The Champion of Elysium would never back down from such a contest. Neither will I."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, ''you're ''not the Champion of Elysium...? You're the Bull of Minos! I can't imagine who's even stronger than you. Is it Heracles? Tell me it's Heracles."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You mean face both of you, together. Which doesn't seem particularly fair."
|-

|-

|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Let us clash here again before you face the Champion. We never will allow you through without a fight."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You're nothing like Theseus. Why go along with everything he says and does? You're your own man. And bull."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"King Theseus slew me in life, and saved me in death. I was cast into Erebus. A monster. He found me when he died. And used his influence to bring me here, with him."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's nice of him and all, but sounds like you're even to me. Seeing as he killed you in the first place."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"No; we're not. And I will fight for him, and alongside him, for eternity. As recompense for helping me to understand exactly who I am."
|-
! colspan="2" |Minotaur Defeated Theseus 01
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"You bested the Champion, himself. Which means that I have little hope of vanquishing you, here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So then, why bother fighting me? You don't have to do this. That Theseus is a highly questionable influence on you!"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I see you plain, short one. I, too, was born of darkness. But, I chose the path of light. Even in death, it was not too late. ''<Snort> ''Not even for a monster, such as I. I trust your deaths will likewise be enlightening."

|"''Ah''. I sense another furious battle here awaits us, short one. Although you're more inquisitive than usual..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Uhh'', oh! It's just, I have an odd request. You see, the god of slumber, Hypnos? Colleague of mine. Huge fan. He's in desperate need of your autograph. Little personalized message? I don't suppose you'd be so kind. It'd mean a lot to him."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Autograph. I see. Then, it appears there are such gods as favor me. I will inscribe a bit of parchment for your colleague, then."
|-
|'''Storyteller'''
|"''The god-forsaken Minotaur impresses then upon a parchment a brief message to the god of sleep, and gives it to the favor-asking Prince.''"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Know, short one, that this favor is for you and not for Hypnos. Though he may challenge me himself, at any time."
|-
! colspan="2" |Minotaur About Fist Weapon 01
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"''Huh''. You mean to fight with me bare-handed this time, short one? I'm not ashamed to say the Champion himself defeated me in such a manner back when we drew breath."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wouldn't say the Twin Fists of Malphon counts as empty-handed, sir, though it surprises me to hear you could be beaten in such a way."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I was hungry and unprepared. Inexperienced. No longer. Come."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, I was going to say, I'd much prefer we settle this more amicably, couldn't we? Perhaps I could interest you in a fine bottle of Nectar? Ambrosia, even?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"No, thank you. These battles are enough. Besides... you won that Ambrosia from us, fair and square."
|-
! colspan="2" |Minotaur About Friendship 02
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Well, you're back, short one. Or Prince. Whatever they call you. I'm not much for formality."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Not much for it either, here, Asterius. Though, speaking of which, how would you prefer to be addressed? The Minotaur, the Bull of Minos? Those aren't offensive to you, are they?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"They don't mean anything to me. They mean something to others. I have my name. You know it. Use it if you want. Now, enough."
|-
! colspan="2" |Minotaur About Skelly 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, you're from Crete, originally, aren't you, Asterius? I know this is a stretch, but... I don't suppose you ever heard of a commander by the name of ''Schelemeus''? Captain of the Cretan second fleet, something like that?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"The king of Crete commanded the greatest navy in the world. Even I knew that, having never seen the light of day, the ships, the sea. ''Schelemeus'', huh...? I might have heard the name. So what?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, Schelemeus was a real person, then? But, Skelly said... ah, you know what, it's nothing, Asterius. Shall we?"

|"Yes. Let's."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Come on, Asterius, we've fought how many times already? What's there to dream about?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"No. I dreamed. And in my dream, there was something I had to tell you. Rather... something you have to tell the weapons you wear on your hands. Tell them, '''I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death.'''"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, I know what that is, that's a waking-phrase. So I'm to speak it to Malphon. Wait, why are you helping me?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I don't know whether I'm helping you or not. But in my dream... an ancient hero fought a beast of a man, barehanded. They became friends, in the end, after a great battle. I long for a fight like that."
|-
! colspan="2" |Minotaur Clear Progress 01
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I wonder something, short one. You keep coming back. But I don't know why. You're trying to get out of here, aren't you? But something's killing you up there."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You've deduced more or less correctly, Asterius. And yes, let's say there are some challenges remaining once I get out of Elysium. Though I'd best say no more of it than that."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"That's fine. It's good to know you've fallen just as often as I have. I may not be the one to kill you. But I'll soften you up for whoever does."
|-
! colspan="2" |Minotaur Clear Progress 01 B
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"You ever make it out of here, short one? I wonder, sometimes, what it must be like... the outside."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You've never been outside? Oh, right... the labyrinth thing. You lived in a horrible maze all your life. I haven't seen much of the surface, but... it's beautiful. Cold. When I'm there, though, I... feel out of place."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Out of place. I understand, I think. I don't see why you'd want to go somewhere like that. It can't live up to the stories. Why ruin it? Speaking of which..."

|-
|'''Minotaur'''

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, for me, at least, it happens to mean quite a bit. I'm her son!"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"It doesn't mean a thing. We're still here to fight. Though, for what it's worth... my mother also was a queen. May yours treat you better than she treated me. Better than I'm about to treat you, here."

|"Great! Thanks for the encouragement, Asterius. Don't let me keep you waiting on that, then."

|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"You have returned to my chamber. I trust you are familiar now with what this means."
|-

|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"That... ''<Snort> ''Yes. Essentially that is correct. Prepare."
|-

|"It would seem ''<Snort> ''that the time for additional ''fun ''has arrived."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''

|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Then, good. You have much to enjoy in store."
|-
! colspan="2" |Minotaur Encounter 06
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, you hurt me with this '''short one''' business almost as much as with that axe. Why isn't Theseus '''short one'''? We're the same height!"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"No. The king is greater. He is the greatest king of Athens! What are you? A willful son of a fickle god. I am beneath your father's notice. And you are beneath the king's. Now fight me."
