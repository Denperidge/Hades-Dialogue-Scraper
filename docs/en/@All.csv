Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|...I spent many days tending this garden... or nights? Quite difficult to tell the time here. But, it's held on longer than I would have expected...
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|...Persephone... I...
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|Cerberus! I missed you so. And dutiful as ever, aren't you.
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|...I'm sorry. Know that I am sorry.
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|Hades... you look tired. Though, I am not the only one you ought to be apologizing to.
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|I know. I know, I.... Why have you returned? If Olympus... if your mother discovers what happened, not even Zeus, not even *he *could stop what would transpire, here!
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|*Oh*, I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Zagreus to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could just return the way I came?
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Persephone.
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|You're right, Hades! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|Then, first, talk to your son.
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|...*Mm*. Zagreus? You have already met Persephone, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!
Ending01|Ending 01|Zagreus|Wow, Father, you called me by my name! What is this strange sensation that I feel? Perhaps it's this *deference *of which you speak?
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, Hades. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|Yes. I... Zagreus. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
Ending01|Ending 01|Zagreus|What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought... you're honest.
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left... believing you were stillborn... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done.
Ending01|Ending 01|Zagreus|Well, you didn't need to vent all that inner turmoil onto me throughout my life. Though, I think I understand. I only wish I could have understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I've grown so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really going to miss it.
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|About that... your *ransacking *revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|Zagreus... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
Ending01|Ending 01|Zagreus|Question, Father. Let's say I accept. When next I reach the surface... is it still going to be you waiting up there?
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
Ending01|Ending 01|Zagreus|So I just battle to the surface and repeatedly kill my own father, then?
Ending01|Ending 01|Hades|You have it half-correct!
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
Ending01|Ending 01|Zagreus|*Hahaha*, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
Ending01|Ending 01|Persephone|Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?
Ending01|Ending 01|Zagreus|*After all this time*, it's only been a few days! But it's been good. Mother and Father are back together, made some new friends, got this fancy painting! Easy. All is well in the Underworld!

Flashback03|Flashback 03|Storyteller|*He does not know exactly what he seeks. He only knows that something always has felt off to him, that he does not belong. Who is he, really? Lord Hades never would indulge such questions. So, Prince Zagreus would find out for himself.*
Flashback04|Flashback 04|Storyteller|*He rifles through his Lord Father's possessions. There is not much of any import there. Ledgers and administrative parchmentwork. Correspondence from Olympus which he had ignored. No trace of any reference to his son.*
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Storyteller|*But then, there is the note... written finely in a hand and voice the likes of which the Prince had never seen or heard.*
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Persephone|*'Hades: I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place. So, I am leaving, even if it kills me. I won't be returning to Olympus. If there is a place where I belong in this world, it must be somewhere between heaven and hell. Perhaps it's on the coast and has a little garden. Take care of Cerberus; I shall miss him.'*
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Storyteller|*Thus did Prince of the Underworld Zagreus absorb the contents of this hidden letter, written in his mother's hand.*
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Zagreus|His mother's hand, my mother's hand, wait, *what*?! You're saying this Persephone, that she's my... mother...? But, but Father always said that Nyx was my.... That liar. He lied to me, they both did. All my life!
Flashback05|Flashback 05|Storyteller|*Uhhh erm thus did the Prince discover, inadvertently, the well-kept truth about his lineage. Entirely by chance, this did occur....*
Flashback06|Flashback 06|Storyteller|*Persephone... the one-time Queen of all the Underworld... where had she gone, and why? Engulfed by newfound questions and his rage, the Prince decided to confront his Lord and Master.*
Flashback_DayNightJob_02|Flashback Day Night Job 02|Storyteller|*Responsibility-rejecting Zagreus strides down his Father's hall, quite unconcerned about the urgency with which he is expected to behave under a set of circumstances such as this.*

MegaeraBedroom01|Megaera Bedroom 01|Megaera|...I was just leaving, Zagreus. Happened to be in the area, no thanks to you, and thought I'd go retrieve the last of my possessions. I have to say, you've really let this place go to hell.

MegaeraWithSisyphus02|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Megaera|...And you'll keep busy with your boulder if you know what's good for you, you little cheat. Don't go thinking I'm not watching you.
MegaeraWithSisyphus02|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|I appreciate your vigilance, Madam, and surely I'll be getting Bouldy up this very hill in no time flat, despite the fact that I have never once achieved this!
MegaeraWithSisyphus03|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Megaera|...And when this matter with the Prince is over with, we will be getting back to how things used to be. Until such time, I'd better regularly see your boulder on that hill.
MegaeraWithSisyphus03|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Entirely makes sense to me, Madam, and rest assured that Bouldy, *erm*, that is to say this boulder here, that I will push it regularly, moving forward, same as ever! Now good-bye!
ThanatosWithSisyphus01|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Thanatos|...And, lastly, you're forbidden from offering further assistance to Prince Zagreus. Do we understand each other?
ThanatosWithSisyphus01|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Sisyphus|Why, absolutely, Master Thanatos, I wouldn't think of it! My mind is fully occupied with all the latest boulder-pushing strategies, besides.
ThanatosWithSisyphus01|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Thanatos|Enough! Get back to work, and I'll get back to mine.
ThanatosWithSisyphus02|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|I understand you, Master Thanatos, and will be doing as you say. No more assistance for Prince Zagreus, dead serious this time.
ThanatosWithSisyphus02|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (2)|Thanatos|Good. It shall be both our skins if you are caught in one of your deceptions. See to it that this doesn't happen.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Thanatos|...You would be wise to heed my words next time, and fear the consequences of eluding me. Death can be most unpleasant, as I'm sure you know.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Well, that's just it, Master Thanatos. I never was terribly fearful of you gods, if you'll forgive my saying so. Far as I can tell, all of you seem to have your struggles much like mortals do. A fear of death aside.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Thanatos|What would you know of the struggles of gods? Now you have eternity to think on what you've done. Maybe I'll check again with you after another aeon or two, see if you've learned anything more.
SkellyFirstMeeting|Skelly First Meeting|Skelly|Nice place you got here, boyo! Name's Skelly, how's it going, but enough with the small talk already, I'm here to do a job. So let me have it! Give me everything you got!!
SkellyFirstMeeting|Skelly First Meeting|Zagreus|I don't remember having you on payroll, mate. Who's your supervisor?
SkellyFirstMeeting|Skelly First Meeting|Skelly|*Oh-hoh*, I'm not about to rat my sources, pal! Just try and beat it out of me!
SkellyMiscMeeting01|Skelly Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|Don't suppose I can talk you into fighting back this time?
SkellyMiscMeeting01|Skelly Misc Meeting 01|Skelly|Not a chance, boyo, I'm paid to take it not to dish it out! Now give it to me!!
SkellyMiscMeeting02|Skelly Misc Meeting 02|Skelly|Hey, you're getting pretty strong, there, pal! Though, I am being paid to tell you that! But not being paid to not tell you that last part...
SkellyMiscMeeting02|Skelly Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|I have to ask you something, mate. What do you even need the pay for, anyway?
SkellyMiscMeeting02|Skelly Misc Meeting 02|Skelly|That, pal, is nobody's business but my own! Besides, it's impolite discussing money all the time! Now back to beating me to powder!
SkellyHintMeeting01|Skelly Hint Meeting 01|Skelly|Let me give you a piece of advice, boyo. You run across a guy like me out there, you just give him a good stab right in the back without a second thought before he sends you crying back to Papa.
SkellyHintMeeting02|Skelly Hint Meeting 02|Skelly|You getting pretty strong, I'll give you that, boyo. Strong enough to smack a guy like me right up against the wall and I'd go straight to pieces, *boom*! You just remember, when you're duking it out, the walls are your friend!
SkellyHintMeeting02|Skelly Hint Meeting 02|Zagreus|Smack guys against walls. Sound advice as ever, mate.
SkellyHintMeeting03|Skelly Hint Meeting 03|Skelly|Hey pal watch where you throw those bloodstone things of yours, you drop them, you go pick them up, you understand? But if somebody gives you grief, you got my permission to chuck one right in his eye!
SkellyHintMeeting03|Skelly Hint Meeting 03|Zagreus|I'll just aim generally for the midsection since the eyes are a lot harder to hit in my experience.
SkellyHintMeeting04|Skelly Hint Meeting 04|Skelly|You're pretty quick, you know, boyo! Just be sure to use that fancy dash of yours and keep 'em guessing! Don't let 'em catch you standing still!
SkellyHintMeeting04|Skelly Hint Meeting 04|Zagreus|Dash like mad instead of standing still. That's not the worst advice, I guess.
SkellyHintMeeting05|Skelly Hint Meeting 05|Skelly|Little tip, boyo? You find any coinage while you're out there, you be sure to pawn it off to that old Charon, boatman guy? Use it or lose it, pal, use it or lose it.
SkellyHintMeeting05|Skelly Hint Meeting 05|Zagreus|Thanks, mate, note to self: Always spend everything I earn instead of ever saving.
SkellyHintMeeting06|Skelly Hint Meeting 06|Skelly|Once in a while, pal, you're going to see a real fancy bozo try to ruin your good time. You'll know him 'cause he's glowing like a light, but that's his special armor, see? You got to punch right through it, he's going to shrug you off until you do!
SkellyHintMeeting06|Skelly Hint Meeting 06|Zagreus|For a good time, beware the fancy glowing bozos on my quest. Check.
SkellyHintMeeting07|Skelly Hint Meeting 07|Skelly|You know something, boyo, I think you could do a real number on one of these columns holding up this place, and bring the whole thing down in just a few swipes, boom, boom, *BOOM*! I'd hate to be standing near one of them if you did!
SkellyHintMeeting07|Skelly Hint Meeting 07|Zagreus|Wreck my father's finely crafted architecture every chance I get. That I can do for sure.
SkellyHintMeeting09|Skelly Hint Meeting 09|Skelly|Boyo, next time you make it to the big VIP area upstairs, you watch out for those weapon-wielding gents out there! The eyeball soul thing that pops out when you beat 'em? You got to squash those, too, or else they'll grab their gear and come right back!
SkellyHintMeeting09|Skelly Hint Meeting 09|Zagreus|Crush the souls of Elysium's Exalted shades to stop them from regenerating over and over. I'll definitely do that next time I'm there.
SkellyHintMeeting_EasyMode01|Skelly Hint Meeting Easy Mode 01|Skelly|If you're having a rough time out there, boyo, you just remember something: You're a *god*, all right?! Way tougher than you think. They give you trouble, you just turn on *God Mode*, and you let 'em have it for me!
SkellyHintMeeting_EasyMode01|Skelly Hint Meeting Easy Mode 01|Zagreus|You act as though this *God Mode *is some sort of lever I can simply switch at will if ever I wish to unlock my latent strength, there, mate.
SkellyAboutHintMeetings01|Skelly About Hint Meetings 01|Zagreus|Skelly, how do you know all this stuff, by the way? I mean no offense, but you're a skeleton who just stands around. Yet you have this wealth of knowledge of the Underworld?
SkellyAboutHintMeetings01|Skelly About Hint Meetings 01|Skelly|Hey, I know people, pal! We'll just have to leave it at that. Now let's see you break some of these bones, huh?
SkellyNoMoreHintMeetings01|Skelly No More Hint Meetings 01|Skelly|Well, pal? You have come a pretty long way, let me tell *you*. I think most of the smarts I've picked up, you know by now. And so... if I'm fresh out of tips for you... I guess there's only one thing left to do.
SkellyNoMoreHintMeetings01|Skelly No More Hint Meetings 01|Zagreus|Stand there eternally to be whaled upon at my whim, using whichever weapon suits me at the time?
SkellyAboutSkellyPainting01|Skelly About Skelly Painting 01|Zagreus|Say, mate? I picked up a painting for our lounge that looked a little like yourself. Reminds me... have you ever even been inside? Should come join us sometime.
SkellyAboutSkellyPainting01|Skelly About Skelly Painting 01|Skelly|Ah, you know, while I appreciate that, there, boyo... those kind of social spaces, they're not really for me. I kind of like it out here, just me, these bats whizzing around from time to time.... Besides! The old contract makes it pretty clear I got to stay right here.
SkellyAboutSkellyPainting01|Skelly About Skelly Painting 01|Zagreus|What if I picked you up bodily and brought you in? Contract have anything to say about that?
SkellyRunProgress01|Skelly Run Progress 01|Skelly|Got to say, you're really getting somewhere, boyo, I'm pretty impressed here! And they don't even pay me to do that, I'm just supposed to stand around!
SkellyRunProgress01|Skelly Run Progress 01|Zagreus|Appreciate the vote of confidence, mate. Maybe you're right and someday I'll get out of here. Hey, if I never come back, you won't just be stuck here forever, will you?
SkellyRunProgress01|Skelly Run Progress 01|Skelly|*Heh, hehehe*, that's a good one! *No*! Probably not. Wasn't anything in the old contract about that... *huh*.
SkellyRunProgress02|Skelly Run Progress 02|Skelly|Hitting a wall out there, boyo? Hey I know the feeling. You just keep at it, though! You're getting tougher, getting smarter... between the two of those, I'm thinking you'll pull through soon enough here.
SkellyBackstory01|Skelly Backstory 01|Zagreus|Come on, mate, won't you say who hired you? Was it Achilles? Couldn't have been Nyx...? Is it that big a deal?
SkellyBackstory01|Skelly Backstory 01|Skelly|I am an individual of some integrity, boyo, and protect my sources with my life! You'll have to kill me if you want to make me squeal!
SkellyBackstory02|Skelly Backstory 02|Zagreus|Say, *uh*, Skelly? How'd you get here, anyway?
SkellyBackstory02|Skelly Backstory 02|Skelly|Oh, you know, just kind of zapped right in, like Papa lets us do! Some of us sometimes. Why do you ask?
SkellyBackstory02|Skelly Backstory 02|Zagreus|I meant... how did you get to the realm of the dead, in the first place. Lord Hermes whisk you to the entryway? Thanatos scoop you up, Charon give you a lift, what?
SkellyBackstory02|Skelly Backstory 02|Skelly|Oh, *haha*! Well, that's a little personal, don't you think, boyo? I... I don't like to talk about it much. So, if I could have a little privacy...?
SkellyBackstory03|Skelly Backstory 03|Zagreus|Skelly, is it really true you don't want to talk about how you got here? Just curious who you used to be. What you were like. Your real name.
SkellyBackstory03|Skelly Backstory 03|Skelly|Hey, what makes you think this isn't my real name, pal? I'm offended!
SkellyBackstory03|Skelly Backstory 03|Zagreus|Sorry, what I meant was... I was just interested to get to know you better, after all you've done to help. Anything you can share? Trade you for a detail about me!
SkellyBackstory03|Skelly Backstory 03|Skelly|...Well all right... I was once a commander of men. Name of Schelemeus. Captain of the Cretan second fleet, sailing on Athens under King Minos. We were unstoppable... but then one day... one wrong turn... and we sailed straight into the waters of Charybdis.
SkellyBackstory03|Skelly Backstory 03|Zagreus|Skelly, that's... that's incredible! So then... you and your crew, you perished at sea?
SkellyBackstory03|Skelly Backstory 03|Skelly|I, uh, *pfff, hahaha*, boyo, you are something else, you know? All that Schelemeus stuff, I could have had you eating out of my hand for days!
SkellyBackstory03|Skelly Backstory 03|Zagreus|Oh, I get it. You got me. Fine, then, *Schelemeus*, but I don't appreciate the trick.
SkellyBackstory04|Skelly Backstory 04|Zagreus|Skelly... I'm serious. You really won't tell me anything about you? You're just going to leave me to speculate, forever?
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Zagreus|Say, Skelly... or should I say *Schelemeus*? I happened to have a chat with somebody familiar with that name. Large bull-headed fellow originally from Crete. You said you made it all up! What's going on?
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Skelly|Never said I made it up, pal! I just knew you weren't going to believe me, I mean, look at me! I look like a captain of the Cretan second fleet to you?
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Zagreus|I don't know. I've never met one. Do they all just stand around doing nothing?
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Skelly|Well, sounds like *somebody*'s never had to lead like fifty-or-something sailors in a voyage across the sea in a Minoan galley with nothing but the stars to guide 'em! What do you think the captains do, pull the oars?
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Zagreus|Wait, what about Hermes? He gave me the impression you might have been somebody else. Nobody in particular. Not some great sea-captain.
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Skelly|What is it with you gods talking behind the backs of all your friends, boyo?
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Zagreus|Don't change the subject!
SkellyBackstory05|Skelly Backstory 05|Skelly|Don't change the subject!
SkellyAboutSources01|Skelly About Sources 01|Zagreus|That Lucky Tooth you gave me, Skelly. First off, thanks again, and secondly... is this even yours? Had a run-in with Hermes, who got me thinking.
SkellyAboutSources01|Skelly About Sources 01|Skelly|What, *haha*, you going to believe everything that gabby guy tells you, now, boyo? He doesn't know a thing about me!
SkellyAboutSources01|Skelly About Sources 01|Zagreus|Never said he did. Though since you let on... what's your relationship to him? Working for him?
SkellyAboutSources01|Skelly About Sources 01|Skelly|No! Nope. Definitely not working for him, closer to a peer relationship. Well, other than the fact that he's a god and I'm just... well, what you see is what you get with me, pal. Hey, you won't tell anyone, will you? I'm just here to help, I swear!
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|All right, fess up, Skelly, who are you working for? I know it's not Achilles. It's not Nyx. Dusa has no idea who you are. My father... no way. Hypnos? Give me a break. So the House is ruled out.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Sorry, pal, my lips are sealed. How about we change the subject?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|How about you tell me who your sources are?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Nope!
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|Tell me.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|No way.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|Tell me!
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|I said no!
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|Tell me, Skelly.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Nuh-uh.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|Come on, tell me, please?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|No. Means. No.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|Why won't you tell me?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Nice try, pal.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|What if I never hit you again?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|...Uh... no...?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|So help me, Skelly, if you don't tell me who you're working for, there will be no more violence between us, ever.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|No... please, have mercy, boyo...
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|No mercy, Skelly. Tell me. Or else... it will be only pleasantries between us from here on out.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Nrrrghh, *all right*! But you got to promise me something, promise not to let on or tell anybody in your fancy House, all right? Or else I'm done for. *I'm serious*!
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|I promise. So...?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|...It's Charon.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|Charon! Huh.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Yeah. He's rich. He's got connections to guys like me, and I think he's got a horse in this chariot race you've got going on around here with Papa.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|What's his angle?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|No idea. Maybe he likes you, maybe he's bored.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|And Hermes... he's working for Charon, too?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Yep! Now, let's pretend like none of this ever happened, so I can stick around, all right? Remember, pal, you promised!
SkellyAboutSources03|Skelly About Sources 03|Zagreus|Skelly, did you tell Charon and Hermes about our little conversation from before, about your sources? Because, I didn't tell them, but... they seemed to know.
SkellyAboutSources03|Skelly About Sources 03|Skelly|Boyo, thought we agreed we weren't going to be having conversations on the subject from here on. Spares me having to spill my guts with my sources later.
SkellyAboutSources03|Skelly About Sources 03|Zagreus|I didn't get you into too much trouble, did I?
SkellyAboutSources04|Skelly About Sources 04|Zagreus|Hey, Skelly, what with everything out in the open now, with the Queen and Charon, and all that... mind if I mention some of this to Thanatos? Charon's his brother, after all.
SkellyAboutSources04|Skelly About Sources 04|Skelly|Oh! Yeah, now that you mention it, I guess that part of the old contract no longer applies. So, go right ahead! Appreciate you asking, pal.
SkellyAboutGifting01|Skelly About Gifting 01|Skelly|Pal, thanks again for that Nectar bottle from before, stuff just goes right through me like you won't believe! Though, I hope you're not going around giving that stuff away to every bozo you know.
SkellyAboutGifting01|Skelly About Gifting 01|Zagreus|What, Skelly, you worried something bad is going to happen if I express a bit of generosity from time to time through our somewhat-illicit gift-giving custom around here?
SkellyAboutGifting01|Skelly About Gifting 01|Skelly|No, I'm worried you'll be wasting your time! If you give that stuff away, don't expect to get anything back. Well, not after the first time, anyway. Usually! I'm just saying... don't get your hopes up.
SkellyAboutGifting01|Skelly About Gifting 01|Zagreus|Maybe I just want to show thanks to my friends for its own sake!
SkellyAboutSuperLockKeys01|Skelly About Super Lock Keys 01|Zagreus|Hey, Skelly? You look like you know your way around Tartarus. Found some of this ancient Titan blood out there, and I was looking to score some more.
SkellyAboutSuperLockKeys01|Skelly About Super Lock Keys 01|Skelly|Ah, you've come to the right place regarding that, there, pal! It's your mean weapons back there that can find the stuff. Once you get all the way through Tartarus with one, that's all the blood you're going to get! For the time being anyhow.
SkellyAboutSuperLockKeys01|Skelly About Super Lock Keys 01|Zagreus|How am I supposed to keep track of which weapons I've earned these with, then?
SkellyAboutSuperLockKeys01|Skelly About Super Lock Keys 01|Skelly|I don't know, there's always the invention of writing stuff down? You'll figure something out.
SkellyAboutSuperLockKeys02|Skelly About Super Lock Keys 02|Zagreus|Skelly, you mentioned the ancient bit of blood I found in Tartarus. Know what I'm supposed to do with this stuff?
SkellyAboutSuperLockKeys02|Skelly About Super Lock Keys 02|Skelly|Wouldn't know a thing about it! Definitely doesn't have anything to do with those Infernal Arms of yours, some of which appear to still be *unavailable to you*, as I understand?
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 01|Skelly|So the strangest thing happened while you were out, boyo! One of your weapon holder things back there, it picked up this eerie glow! Could see it from the corner of my eye!
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 01|Zagreus|Calm down, Skelly. I'm sure whatever it is is perfectly normal for a legendary semi-sentient Titan-slaying weapon from the dawn of time.
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 01|Skelly|That's just it! Those weapons of yours, they have seen some real business, pal. You're giving them a real workout, so maybe they're starting to like you or something? Loosening up a bit, you know? Like you and me!
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments02|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 02|Skelly|You know, pal, when you're not around and it's just me and all your weapons, I mean your *Infernal Arms *right over there, between us they are making me a bit uncomfortable.
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments02|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 02|Zagreus|Can't blame you, mate. I wouldn't want to be stuck in a chamber with a bunch of legendary, quite possibly malevolent killing artifacts. Anything I can do?
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments02|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 02|Skelly|Oh I didn't mean it like a bad thing, boyo! The weirder you make those things, the more it gives me the shakes, and keeps me hopping like this nice and steady till the next time you get back! So, thanks!
SkellyAboutFistWeapon01|Skelly About Fist Weapon 01|Zagreus|Say, Skelly? Don't suppose you'd care to tell me how the infamous Twin Fists of Malphon came to be right here in this very courtyard, would you?
SkellyAboutFistWeapon01|Skelly About Fist Weapon 01|Skelly|Nope! Not any of my business, pal, which is to say, I didn't see a thing! And even if I did, it isn't what I'm paid to do! Don't you have someone in your fancy House there paid to keep watch over stuff like that? Ask them!
SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Skelly|Hey, just want to say, pal, that spooky *crimson phoenix *stuff that you were going on about before? I mean, whoa, you just say some nonsense and you get a brand-new spear? I was so impressed, I decided to try that trick for myself!
SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Zagreus|Oh, gods... Skelly, what did you do...?
SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Skelly|Relax, boyo, just had a little chat with your old serving platter over there after you left, is all. That thing hits pretty hard! So, then, I say to it, *I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix*... and you want to know what happened after that?
SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Zagreus|So you carelessly spoke secret words imparted by the Fates themselves to an infernal weapon forged at the dawn of creation, then what? Say, did you walk up to Aegis, or just shout over your shoulder?
SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Skelly|Over my shoulder! Anyway, what happened next was *nothing*! Your *Aegis *kept on bobbing like a dummy. So then I went and said that mumbo jumbo to every other weapon, but nope! Doesn't work at all. So much for your fancy sorcery, huh?
SkellyAboutPact01|Skelly About Pact 01|Zagreus|So, what exactly happened with the formerly pink window over there? Now it's got these sinister orange flames and an enormous Pact of Punishment hanging ominously over the exit. Father stop by?
SkellyAboutPact01|Skelly About Pact 01|Skelly|Pal, I don't know a thing about it, honest! I was just minding my own business, when all the sudden, *wham*! I get hit right in the back. I fall to pieces, no idea what's going on! When I finally come to, the window job was done...!
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01|Skelly|Listen, boyo: I don't know exactly how to put this, so I'm just going to come right out. I need your help with something, and, I'll be honest, I don't think you're going to like it.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01|Zagreus|If it doesn't involve hacking away at you with reckless abandon, Skelly, I don't want to hear it. But... oh. You're being serious.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01|Skelly|I am. And funny you should put it like that. Boyo, I am asking you to get me out of here. *Permanently*, if you catch my drift. This standing around stuff... just kind of wears on you, after a while, you know?
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01|Zagreus|...I know. I can only imagine. Tell me what I can do.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01|Skelly|That blade of yours back there. It's got a special power. You got to spruce it all the way up. Your Aspect, not somebody's else's. Then let me have it with that thing... and I'm out of here.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01|Zagreus|Then you'd be dead, forever? You're asking me to kill you.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01|Skelly|I know it's a lot to dump on you, but I got my reasons. I don't exactly have a lot of options, here, so... give it some thought. Till then, we'll act like nothing's changed, all right?
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01B|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01 B|Skelly|Listen, boyo: I don't know exactly how to put this, so I'm just going to come right out. I need your help with something, and, I'll be honest, I don't think you're going to like it.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01B|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01 B|Zagreus|If it doesn't involve hacking away at you with reckless abandon, Skelly, I don't want to hear it. But... oh. You're being serious.

SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01B|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01 B|Zagreus|...I know. I can only imagine. Tell me what I can do.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01B|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01 B|Skelly|That blade of yours back there. It's got a special power. Your Aspect, now that it's maxed out. You got to let me have it with that thing... and then I'm out of here.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01B|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01 B|Zagreus|Then you'd be dead... forever? You're asking me to kill you.
SkellyTrueDeathQuest_Beginning_01B|Skelly True Death Quest Beginning 01 B|Skelly|I know it's a lot to dump on you, but I got my reasons. I don't exactly have a lot of options, here, so... give it some thought. Till then, we'll act like nothing's changed, all right?
SkellyRunCleared01|Skelly Run Cleared 01|Skelly|So, *uh*, pal? My sources tell me that you made it pretty far. Which means... my usefulness is coming to an end.
SkellyRunCleared01|Skelly Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|Your *usefulness*, what, you just mean the standing around, letting me lay into you with whatever vicious attack sequence I fancy at the time?
SkellyRunCleared01|Skelly Run Cleared 01|Skelly|Yeah! Once you achieve your goal... my contract's up. You won't need me anymore.
SkellyRunCleared01|Skelly Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|But only if I leave for good, isn't that right? So if I stuck around... you'd stay here, too?
SkellyRunCleared01|Skelly Run Cleared 01|Skelly|Probably, but... wait, you're really going to stay?
SkellyPostEnding01|Skelly Post Ending 01|Skelly|So Mama's back in town from what I hear, boyo! It's awful nice knowing I trained you well.
SkellyPostEnding01|Skelly Post Ending 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, you must mean the Queen, and evidently you're aware of our relationship. You keep that quiet, understand, Skelly?
SkellyPostEnding01|Skelly Post Ending 01|Skelly|*Ahh*, and thus the pupil trains the master, for a change! I hear you, pal. Your secret's safe with me.
SkellyPostEpilogue01|Skelly Post Epilogue 01|Skelly|You must have had yourself a real bash, with all those fancy gods and stuff! Could hear all the festivity from all the way out here. How was it, pal?
SkellyPostEpilogue01|Skelly Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|It... went better than expected, all in all. I hope you didn't feel left out! It was a pretty limited guest list. Kind of a diplomatic mission, I would say. Not quite as good a time as it might have sounded from the outside.
SkellyPostEpilogue01|Skelly Post Epilogue 01|Skelly|*Ohh*, don't you even worry about me, there, pal! I much prefer the solitary life, and besides! When things are good for you, they're good for me. Glad everything worked out.
SkellyChat01|Skelly Chat 01|Skelly|Less yakking, more smacking, boyo, now come on!
SkellyChat02|Skelly Chat 02|Skelly|Less chatter, more batter, boyo, hit me already!
SkellyChat03|Skelly Chat 03|Skelly|Less talking, more socking, here, pal!
SkellyChat04|Skelly Chat 04|Skelly|Come on, boyo, less gabbing, more stabbing over here!
SkellyChat05|Skelly Chat 05|Skelly|Less prattle, more battle, boyo, give me all you got!
SkellyChat06|Skelly Chat 06|Skelly|Can't break *these *bones, pal, what you just try it!
SkellyChat07|Skelly Chat 07|Skelly|You want another a piece of this, or what?
SkellyChat08|Skelly Chat 08|Skelly|Enough with the small talk, boyo, hit me, go on!
SkellyChat09|Skelly Chat 09|Skelly|Trying to bore me to death with all this chit-chat, pal?
SkellyChat10|Skelly Chat 10|Skelly|This look like a shoulder to cry on to you, boyo?
SkellyChat11|Skelly Chat 11|Skelly|Let me have it already, boyo, no holding back!
SkellyChat12|Skelly Chat 12|Skelly|Let's see what you can do in terms of hitting me, pal!
SkellyChat13|Skelly Chat 13|Skelly|You could be hitting me right now, boyo!
SkellyChat14|Skelly Chat 14|Skelly|Sure could go for somebody just whaling away on me right now.
SkellyChat15|Skelly Chat 15|Skelly|What's the matter, you gone soft or something, pal?
SkellyChat16|Skelly Chat 16|Skelly|You going to hit me over here, or what?
SkellyChat17|Skelly Chat 17|Skelly|Go on, boyo, give me your best shot, it's my job!
SkellyChat18|Skelly Chat 18|Skelly|Sure could use a good smack in the jaw from you right about now!
SkellyChat19|Skelly Chat 19|Skelly|You want to fight me, boyo, well hop to it, stat!
SkellyChat20|Skelly Chat 20|Skelly|What do I look like, pal, some kind of conversationalist?
SkellyChat21|Skelly Chat 21|Skelly|Our relationship, boyo, requires no exchange of words!
SkellyGift01|Skelly Gift 01|Zagreus|For you, mate! Thought you might get a kick out of this.
SkellyGift01|Skelly Gift 01|Skelly|For me, pal? Awful nice of you, just awful nice, but guess what, I got this for you! Tit for tat, you understand, a deal's a deal!
SkellyGift02|Skelly Gift 02|Skelly|*Whoa-hoh*, you being serious here, pal? You brought that all this way, for little old me?! That's real nice of you!
SkellyGift02|Skelly Gift 02|Zagreus|You're not so bad yourself, mate. Thanks for always being here for me to savagely attack without a second thought.
SkellyGift03|Skelly Gift 03|Skelly|*Whoaaaa*, now get a load of what you got there, boyo! Wait, really, that's for me? Or you just pulling my leg?
SkellyGift03|Skelly Gift 03|Zagreus|I'm really giving this to you, mate. Now go enjoy it, will you? Once I've finished pummeling you some more just for the sake of it.
SkellyGift04|Skelly Gift 04|Skelly|Heeey now *that's *what I'm talking about, thanks, boyo! Won't forget you doing me a solid like this, cross my heart!!
SkellyGift04|Skelly Gift 04|Zagreus|No need to thank me, mate. But don't you dare forget it or I'll attack you repeatedly and without mercy.
SkellyGift05|Skelly Gift 05|Skelly|Oh look here, pal, I can't just keep accepting these from you! Not when they're paying me already, I got standards to uphold, you know?
SkellyGift05|Skelly Gift 05|Zagreus|I will look the other way if you do, mate. Now, here! Or else!
SkellyGift06|Skelly Gift 06|Skelly|*Haaah*, you're kidding, *what*? Sometimes, boyo, you make me feel alive again, you know that? Being honest with you here, I'm grateful, really.
SkellyGift06|Skelly Gift 06|Zagreus|If not for you, my friend, I'd have no one to viciously attack with no fear of reprisal whatsoever.
SkellyGift07|Skelly Gift 07|Zagreus|Skelly, while I know your services have already been paid in full, your sources ought to know you've been doing an excellent job. So much so, I wanted to give you this.
SkellyGift07|Skelly Gift 07|Skelly|*Whaaa*, is that a vintage bottle of Ambrosia, pal?! I never even thought I'd get to try a thing like that, I mean, what am I, here? Know what, I want you to have this. To symbolize our friendship, and in case you ever need a hand out there.
SkellyGift08|Skelly Gift 08|Zagreus|Hope you enjoyed that vintage bottle of Ambrosia last time, Skelly, because I got you another. Here!
SkellyGift08|Skelly Gift 08|Skelly|*Aww*, no way, boyo, you kidding me right now? Why are you even, I... look, I, I just stand around and let you beat me up, you don't have to do this. You don't even know who I am. Who I was.
SkellyGift08|Skelly Gift 08|Zagreus|You're my friend, mate. That's all that matters. Although... I don't suppose you're willing to divulge those types of details? Just out of curiosity.
SkellyGift09|Skelly Gift 09|Zagreus|You know, Skelly, I still cannot entirely get over that whole permanently-kill-you stunt you pulled on me. You had me deeply worried for a while, all for just a laugh?
SkellyGift09|Skelly Gift 09|Skelly|Yeah, that's right! Not exactly much to do here, case you hadn't noticed recently! Good thing I'm able to stay occupied with intellectual pursuits.
SkellyGift09|Skelly Gift 09|Zagreus|That's what you call it, then? In any case, I did want to make sure: You sure that you're all right, having to stand around like this?
SkellyGift09|Skelly Gift 09|Skelly|You kidding, pal? This is the life! Imagine getting paid to stand around! And being pals with you!
SkellyTrueDeathQuestComplete|Skelly True Death Quest Complete|Skelly|*Hahaha*, got you pretty good, again, didn't I, boyo?! *I am asking you to get me out of here. *Hahahaha! All that stuff about your blade, and your Aspect, I mean, you ate all of it right up! *Woo, hoo-hoo!*
SkellyTrueDeathQuestComplete|Skelly True Death Quest Complete|Zagreus|It appears I've been the victim of an elaborate prank. Not sure that I appreciate it, Skelly. What if I were to never hit you again, how would you like that?
SkellyTrueDeathQuestComplete|Skelly True Death Quest Complete|Skelly|Whoa, *whoa whoa whoa whoa*, whoa! Now come on, boyo, it was just a joke, I figured things could lighten up a little here. Don't need to do anything rash!
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Megaera|My sisters and I. We've had a chance to talk, and we have come to an agreement, Zagreus. As you can see.
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Alecto|Megaera, Tis, you ready?
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Tisiphone|*Mmurdererr*!
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Zagreus|Three against one. Doesn't seem all that sporting, now, does it?
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Megaera|We're each well past the need for any sport. We'll kill you, whatever it takes. Erinyes! *Now*.
FurySistersUnion02|Fury Sisters Union 02|Megaera|What's the matter, Zagreus? You look a bit uncomfortable. Something you want to say to me? Or any one of us?
FurySistersUnion02|Fury Sisters Union 02|Zagreus|Well, it's just... there's something that I wanted to discuss with you, at some point, Meg, but after more consideration, I am thinking maybe now is not the time.
FurySistersUnion02|Fury Sisters Union 02|Megaera|I understand entirely. Though you should know my sisters and I keep no secrets from each other, anymore. Isn't that right, Sisters?
FuryPostSistersUnion01|Fury Post Sisters Union 01|Megaera|*Eugh*, I almost want to thank you, Zagreus. I thought you'd never change that blasted Pact, and leave me here, in peace.
FuryPostSistersUnion01|Fury Post Sisters Union 01|Zagreus|What, you mean you aren't lonelier without Alecto's or Tisiphone's companionship? They seem so wonderful to have around.
FuryPostSistersUnion01|Fury Post Sisters Union 01|Megaera|They're tolerable each to some extent. About as much as I can say for you. Now let's the two of us begin.
FurySisterUnionSingleSis01|Fury Sister Union Single Sis 01|Megaera|See, Alecto? He is right on time, just as I said.
FurySisterUnionSingleSis01|Fury Sister Union Single Sis 01|Alecto|Megaera, *bleed *him!
FurySisterUnionSingleSis02|Fury Sister Union Single Sis 02|Megaera|Heads up, Tisiphone. I think I found a murderer for you.
FurySisterUnionSingleSis02|Fury Sister Union Single Sis 02|Tisiphone|*Mmuuurrr*derrrr...
FuryMetSisters01|Fury Met Sisters 01|Megaera|I have to level with you, Zagreus. For all we've been through... never once have I wanted you to meet my sisters.
FuryMetSisters01|Fury Met Sisters 01|Zagreus|I can't imagine why not! We had a lovely time getting to know each other. We laughed, we cried! My only regret was that you couldn't be there, yourself.
FuryMetSisters01|Fury Met Sisters 01|Megaera|You don't know what you're saying. There's a reason that they're not permitted in the House. Though, come on. One of us is going back there, now.
FuryMetSisters02|Fury Met Sisters 02|Megaera|You've really done it, Zagreus. My sisters have returned. All three of us now share the same assignment.
FuryMetSisters02|Fury Met Sisters 02|Zagreus|Is it wrong of me that I am somewhat honored to have garnered the attention of the Erinyes?
FuryMetSisters02|Fury Met Sisters 02|Megaera|Oh I would say it's very wrong of you, indeed.
FuryNoDarknessReaction01|Fury No Darkness Reaction 01|Megaera|I sense something different about you, Zagreus. Your old weakness. *Ah*... the Mirror. I thought you said you weren't trying to compete with me?
FuryNoDarknessReaction01|Fury No Darkness Reaction 01|Zagreus|I wasn't. But then you gave me a good idea to try. I'm not as weak as I once was. With or without the Mirror's help.
FuryNoDarknessReaction01|Fury No Darkness Reaction 01|Megaera|Is that so? Well then let's see if you're correct. Come on.
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Fury About Persephone Meeting 01|Megaera|I heard that you escaped. Then, what are you still doing here? Forget something along the way?
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Fury About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|You know... I think I'd rather fight you to the death again than try to answer either of those questions, right now.
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Fury About Persephone Meeting 01|Megaera|I don't know what you're up to, Zagreus. But I guess it doesn't matter, either way. All that matters is you're not getting past me.
FuryPostEnding01|Fury Post Ending 01|Megaera|Your mother has returned to us, already, Zagreus. And still you're going to keep battling your way out, past me and everything up there? Why?
FuryPostEnding01|Fury Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Father says there's no escape from here, and I like to repeatedly show him he's wrong. Besides, I think getting out there a bit from time to time does me some good.
FuryPostEnding01|Fury Post Ending 01|Megaera|Sounds like you've found yourself a steady line of work. Most jobs just need doing. If this one gives you some fulfillment, stick to it. Now, come on.
FuryAboutEpilogueReunionQuest01|Fury About Epilogue Reunion Quest 01|Megaera|What is it that you're up to now, Zagreus? The Queen is back. But still you're making me show up like this?
FuryAboutEpilogueReunionQuest01|Fury About Epilogue Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Got some unfinished business with the Olympians to take care of, was in the area, figured I'd say hi. Hi, Meg!
FuryAboutEpilogueReunionQuest01|Fury About Epilogue Reunion Quest 01|Megaera|Don't start with me. You show up here, we fight, somebody dies. That's it. Now, who's it going to be?
FuryPostIntermission01|Fury Post Intermission 01|Megaera|Been seeing an awful lot of each other lately, haven't we. You had enough of me, yet, Zag?
FuryPostIntermission01|Fury Post Intermission 01|Zagreus|Never enough, Meg. You ready for another go at it, too, I take it?
FuryPostIntermission01|Fury Post Intermission 01|Megaera|Always. Although I do like to keep things fresh, so... surprise me.
FuryEncounterStoryProgress01|Fury Encounter Story Progress 01|Megaera|Listen to me, Zagreus. Your mother is long gone. You're never getting out of here, and even if you did, what hope could you possibly have in finding her up in the world out there?
FuryEncounterStoryProgress01|Fury Encounter Story Progress 01|Zagreus|I've hope enough. Not that it's any of your business anymore.
FuryEncounterStoryProgress01|Fury Encounter Story Progress 01|Megaera|Your family is here. And so is your responsibility. You're running from yourself. Though, I can slow you down a bit I think.
FuryEncounterGunWeapon01|Fury Encounter Gun Weapon 01|Megaera|*What*... where did you get the Rail? Do you know what you have? Where are your customary weapons?
FuryEncounterGunWeapon01|Fury Encounter Gun Weapon 01|Zagreus|I left them at home. And, I sort of know what I have, inasmuch as it's largely responsible for getting me this far. Would you like to see a demonstration?
FuryEncounterGunWeapon01|Fury Encounter Gun Weapon 01|Megaera|Yes, I would. I always have, as a matter of fact.
FuryEncounterFistWeapon01|Fury Encounter Fist Weapon 01|Megaera|What's that you're holding, Zagreus? Please tell me that you didn't steal the most dangerous, unstable artifacts sealed shut within your father's vault.
FuryEncounterFistWeapon01|Fury Encounter Fist Weapon 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, it wasn't I who stole them, if that's any reassurance to you, Meg!
FuryEncounterFistWeapon01|Fury Encounter Fist Weapon 01|Megaera|You are a hopeless fool. You cannot possibly know what you're doing with those things. You put them back exactly where you found them.
FuryAboutDusaFiring01|Fury About Dusa Firing 01|Megaera|...Nyx really let Dusa go?
FuryAboutDusaFiring01|Fury About Dusa Firing 01|Zagreus|She did... so you heard. I don't know what happened. You didn't even get a chance to say goodbye?
FuryAboutDusaFiring01|Fury About Dusa Firing 01|Megaera|No. Damn it. If you had anything to do with this...! Even if you didn't, come on and die!
FuryPactReaction03|Fury Pact Reaction 03|Megaera|What have you done with the Pact, Zagreus? This isn't even Asphodel, and I can barely tolerate the heat. Do you really want to die this terribly?
FuryPactReaction03|Fury Pact Reaction 03|Zagreus|Appreciate all the concern, but I just thought I'd live a little, Meg. You ought to try it for yourself, sometime!
FuryPactReaction03|Fury Pact Reaction 03|Megaera|You ought to try watching your mouth. You want a swift and painful death, you'll have one momentarily.
FuryFirstAppearanceFirstRun|Fury First Appearance First Run|Megaera|Halt, Zagreus. Not one step further.
FuryFirstAppearanceFirstRun|Fury First Appearance First Run|Zagreus|Come on, Meg. Haven't we had more than enough of each other by now? Besides, don't you have someplace else to be?
FuryFirstAppearanceFirstRun|Fury First Appearance First Run|Megaera|You know exactly why I'm here. Now shut your mouth, and come die like a man.
FuryFirstAppearance|Fury First Appearance|Megaera|Halt, Zagreus. Not one step further.
FuryFirstAppearance|Fury First Appearance|Zagreus|Come on, Meg. Haven't we had more than enough of each other by now? Besides, don't you have someplace else to be?
FuryFirstAppearance|Fury First Appearance|Megaera|Your father sent me. All in all, I'd rather be on your bad side than his. Now you can turn back like a good little man, or I can send you home the painful way. What'll it be?
FuryFirstAppearance|Fury First Appearance|Zagreus|...I'll have to go with the painful way.
FuryFirstAppearance|Fury First Appearance|Megaera|A man after my own heart.
FuryEncounterStoryProgress02|Fury Encounter Story Progress 02|Megaera|Tell me something, Zag, because I'm curious. Do your Olympian relatives know the real reason you've been trying to escape?
FuryEncounterStoryProgress02|Fury Encounter Story Progress 02|Zagreus|I'll get around to that in due time. They're family. They'll understand no doubt.
FuryEncounterStoryProgress02|Fury Encounter Story Progress 02|Megaera|You're in over your head, you idiot. You'll fray what bonds are left between Lord Hades and those ingrates on Olympus.
FuryAboutBeingClose01|Fury About Being Close 01|Megaera|Things can't entirely be different between you and me. You know that, don't you, Zag? Not when it comes to this, at least.
FuryAboutBeingClose01|Fury About Being Close 01|Zagreus|I do. We wouldn't both be consummate professionals if it were any other way. You won't be going easy on me, will you?
FuryAboutBeingClose01|Fury About Being Close 01|Megaera|I'm going to pretend you didn't ask me that. Now give me everything you've got!
FuryAboutBeingClose02|Fury About Being Close 02|Megaera|What is it, Zagreus? You've got that pleased-with-yourself look, which can only mean you have something obnoxious to tell me.
FuryAboutBeingClose02|Fury About Being Close 02|Zagreus|*I never*! Look, I'm simply pleased to see you, Meg. Hence the insuppressible smile. Could have been one of your lovely sisters here instead...
FuryAboutBeingClose02|Fury About Being Close 02|Megaera|You're not going to throw me off my guard that easily. My sisters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Fury About Persephone Meeting 02|Megaera|And where, exactly, do you think you're going, Zagreus?
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Fury About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|I think I'm going all the way to the top again, Meg. To find my mother. You won't stop me. Get out of my way.
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Fury About Persephone Meeting 02|Megaera|We both know that's not going to happen. Getting out of your way, I mean.
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Fury About Persephone Meeting 03|Megaera|Your mother, Zagreus. You really think you'll find her once again, out there? Even if you make it out... maybe she's found another hiding place.
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Fury About Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|It isn't us she's hiding from up there. Father let her go. He never wanted to go after her. So I appreciate your concern, but I'll find her again.
FuryAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Fury About Persephone Meeting 03|Megaera|That sounds like information neither one of them would want for me to know. You know the punishment for spilling secrets, don't you?
FuryRunClearedReaction02|Fury Run Cleared Reaction 02|Megaera|What are you doing, Zagreus? The Underworld is sealed off. What you're attempting is impossible. You've seen what happens when you go too far.
FuryRunClearedReaction02|Fury Run Cleared Reaction 02|Zagreus|This place can't stay sealed shut forever, Meg. In the meantime, I thought I'd get some practice in, you know?
FuryRunClearedReaction02|Fury Run Cleared Reaction 02|Megaera|I'm not your practice partner, fool.
FuryStoryProgress01|Fury Story Progress 01|Megaera|May I help you with something, Zagreus?
FuryStoryProgress01|Fury Story Progress 01|Zagreus|Now that you mention it, you can, Meg. I was wondering what was Father carrying on with you about back home?
FuryStoryProgress01|Fury Story Progress 01|Megaera|Eavesdropping again? If you must know, my job performance is under review. Though, I'm sure this job's about to go just fine.
FuryStoryProgress02|Fury Story Progress 02|Megaera|I sincerely hope that you enjoy these meetings with me while you can. I know I will.
FuryStoryProgress02|Fury Story Progress 02|Zagreus|Now that's a rather ominous thing to say to someone, Meg. Care to explain in terms an idiot like me could understand?
FuryStoryProgress02|Fury Story Progress 02|Megaera|Lord Hades is exploring other options. He has no confidence in my ability to stop you anymore. Though, maybe it isn't too late for me to change his mind.
FuryRunProgress01|Fury Run Progress 01|Megaera|It's been a while, Zagreus. You must have made it pretty far last time. Let's see. Outer reaches of Asphodel?
FuryRunProgress01|Fury Run Progress 01|Zagreus|Outer reaches of Asphodel. And I have to say, Meg, you are positively a sight compared with that blasted Bone Hydra stewing away up there.
FuryRunProgress01|Fury Run Progress 01|Megaera|How very flattering, to have compared me to the remains of some mindless outsized lizard. Come, maybe I'll kill you just as easily as your new Hydra friend.
FuryRunProgress02|Fury Run Progress 02|Megaera|How many times have we been going at it like this, Zagreus? You tired of me, yet?
FuryRunProgress02|Fury Run Progress 02|Zagreus|We're both immortals, Meg. We'll be seeing plenty of each other for a while yet. I've come to welcome these occasions.
FuryRunProgress02|Fury Run Progress 02|Megaera|Then, good. Lashing you across the face beats waiting for the opportunity to do so. Come.
FuryRunProgress03|Fury Run Progress 03|Megaera|I heard what happened. You crossed the River of Flame. You really did it.
FuryRunProgress03|Fury Run Progress 03|Zagreus|That Hydra was a total bastard, though. Bastard*s*. But, you sound practically impressed with me, there, Meg! I feel so flattered!
FuryRunProgress03|Fury Run Progress 03|Megaera|You'll soon feel something else. I don't know how you did it. But it changes nothing.
FuryRunProgress04|Fury Run Progress 04|Megaera|How utterly disgusting... I was just counting, Zagreus, and as it happens, I have lost to you fifty times, already! If not more. Can you believe this? *Ugh*, how I've fallen.
FuryRunProgress04|Fury Run Progress 04|Zagreus|Oh, don't take it so hard, Meg! Once you die several dozen times, you start to get accustomed to the emotional pain, as well as the physical! Up for some more of either?
FuryRunProgress04|Fury Run Progress 04|Megaera|Of course! Who do you think I am? Although I guess there's no use keeping score with you.
FuryRunProgress05|Fury Run Progress 05|Megaera|You know how many times you've beaten me, here, Zagreus? Can you even guess?
FuryRunProgress05|Fury Run Progress 05|Zagreus|*Erm*... feels like a lot, admittedly, I mean, we've been going at this for a while, now. Four hundred and twelve times...?
FuryRunProgress05|Fury Run Progress 05|Megaera|...Five hundred times, exactly. Though I figure, you haven't been keeping track of how many times I've killed you. *Ugh*, maybe that's my problem. Well, plenty of time to work it out after this.
FuryAboutAlecto01|Fury About Alecto 01|Megaera|You beat Alecto, Zag. Could hear her screaming her head off about it all the way through Tartarus... I almost want to thank you.
FuryAboutAlecto01|Fury About Alecto 01|Zagreus|I almost want to say you're very welcome. Have you and she always been on bad terms like this?
FuryAboutAlecto01|Fury About Alecto 01|Megaera|We have long-standing differences. It's worse with family. You know what it's like.
FuryAboutTisiphone01|Fury About Tisiphone 01|Megaera|*Huh*. Not even Tisiphone could stop you. Your father must be sorely disappointed.
FuryAboutTisiphone01|Fury About Tisiphone 01|Zagreus|He's difficult to please, that much is true. What happened to Tisiphone, anyway? She isn't much for conversation.
FuryAboutTisiphone01|Fury About Tisiphone 01|Megaera|It runs in the family. Tis only knows her work. And, professional distance is important.
FuryAboutSisyphus01|Fury About Sisyphus 01|Megaera|If there's anyone in all the Underworld who owes you, Zagreus, it's your friend, Sisyphus. He would be much worse off if not for you.
FuryAboutSisyphus01|Fury About Sisyphus 01|Zagreus|What, because I've been distracting you from administering lashings like before? I hate to think you prefer to whip with no fear of reprisal whatsoever, Meg.
FuryAboutSisyphus01|Fury About Sisyphus 01|Megaera|Dereliction of duty and fear of reprisal are not one and the same. Though you don't seem to be concerned with either one.
FuryNoHammerReaction01|Fury No Hammer Reaction 01|Megaera|Your weapon's looking rather dull, there, Zagreus. Great Daedalus decided not to grace you with his gifts this time around?
FuryNoHammerReaction01|Fury No Hammer Reaction 01|Zagreus|Now that you mention it, he hasn't, no. Though I'm prepared to say I don't need special augmentations to get past you.
FuryNoHammerReaction01|Fury No Hammer Reaction 01|Megaera|Oh, we can put that to the test right now. Just remember, you need all the help you can get.
FuryDarknessReaction01|Fury Darkness Reaction 01|Megaera|That Mirror's made you stronger, Zagreus. You're fortunate to have Nyx helping you.
FuryDarknessReaction01|Fury Darkness Reaction 01|Zagreus|No hard feelings. I think she feels partly responsible for all of this.
FuryDarknessReaction01|Fury Darkness Reaction 01|Megaera|She shouldn't. The only one responsible for all of this is you. And I thought even you would have understood that by now.
FuryPactReaction01|Fury Pact Reaction 01|Megaera|*Tsch*. I can't believe it. You signed the Pact of Punishment. Have you completely lost your mind? Or just trying to insult me?
FuryPactReaction01|Fury Pact Reaction 01|Zagreus|Well if you're going to be so rude about it, maybe a little of each? Though, what do you even care which pacts I sign or don't?
FuryPactReaction01|Fury Pact Reaction 01|Megaera|I'm not an idiot. I see what you're doing. You want to be punished? Then, come on.
FuryPactReaction01_B|Fury Pact Reaction 01 B|Megaera|*Tsch*. You really volunteered into a Pact of Punishment? You can't back out of it, now. You're even more of a fool than I already thought.
FuryPactReaction01_B|Fury Pact Reaction 01 B|Zagreus|Maybe I just like a challenge, ever thought of that? Besides, what do you even care which pacts I sign or don't?
FuryPactReaction01_B|Fury Pact Reaction 01 B|Megaera|You're right. I *don't *care. You want to be punished? Then, come on.
FuryPactReaction02|Fury Pact Reaction 02|Megaera|I have been longing for a fairer fight with you. Maybe that's why you signed the Pact? To pity me?
FuryPactReaction02|Fury Pact Reaction 02|Zagreus|I have my reasons. Pitying you isn't one of them. Although I guess you don't believe me, do you?
FuryPactReaction02|Fury Pact Reaction 02|Megaera|If it's punishment you want, how am I to say no?
FuryPactReaction02_B|Fury Pact Reaction 02 B|Megaera|You know I can hit even harder than usual with the Pact of Punishment working against you. Maybe that's why you signed it? To pity me?
FuryPactReaction02_B|Fury Pact Reaction 02 B|Zagreus|I have my reasons. Pitying you isn't one of them. Although I guess you don't believe me, do you?
FuryPactReaction02_B|Fury Pact Reaction 02 B|Megaera|No, I don't think I do. Come on, then, and let's see where all your pity gets you.
FuryPactReaction04|Fury Pact Reaction 04|Megaera|This should be over pretty quickly, I think, Zag. Never took you for the Forced Overtime type. That's not a Pact condition for the faint of heart.
FuryPactReaction04|Fury Pact Reaction 04|Zagreus|You wound me, Meg! You know I like to barge into situations thoughtlessly and recklessly, and sort everything out later. Forced Overtime's the perfect fit!
FuryPactReaction04|Fury Pact Reaction 04|Megaera|*Ahh*, well, when you put it that way. Look, don't go saying I didn't warn you.
FuryChaosReaction01|Fury Chaos Reaction 01|Megaera|Hold it, Zagreus. I sense something, is that... *ah*. You've been in contact with Chaos. So even they are now involved with this.
FuryChaosReaction01|Fury Chaos Reaction 01|Zagreus|Just because Chaos is giving me the power to crush you doesn't mean they're getting involved with this, does it?
FuryChaosReaction01|Fury Chaos Reaction 01|Megaera|You don't know who or what you're dealing with. Ask Nyx about them for me sometime. Here, I'll give you a chance to ask her very soon.
FuryThanatosReaction01|Fury Thanatos Reaction 01|Megaera|I know that Thanatos assisted you in getting to this point. I don't appreciate his interference.
FuryThanatosReaction01|Fury Thanatos Reaction 01|Zagreus|I'm sure you'll have a chance to tell him back at home.
FuryThanatosReaction01|Fury Thanatos Reaction 01|Megaera|He has domain over the wretched shades, but his power has no sway with me. And neither does your own.
FuryThanatosReaction02|Fury Thanatos Reaction 02|Megaera|I still cannot believe that Thanatos is helping you. I mistook him for someone with integrity.
FuryThanatosReaction02|Fury Thanatos Reaction 02|Zagreus|You mistook him for someone who blindly follows orders without considering the implications.
FuryThanatosReaction02|Fury Thanatos Reaction 02|Megaera|How dare you...! If you like death so much, then here, let me indulge you. Thanatos will welcome you with open arms.
FuryHighRelationship01|Fury High Relationship 01|Megaera|Prince Zagreus, you are trespassing beyond the limits of your authority. I am under orders to stop you.
FuryHighRelationship01|Fury High Relationship 01|Zagreus|Come on, Meg, why so formal all of a sudden? We've been through this countless times. Wait, is it because...?
FuryHighRelationship01|Fury High Relationship 01|Megaera|Oh, come on, Zag. Will you just learn to play along, for once? Come on and fight me like you mean it.
FuryHighRelationship02|Fury High Relationship 02|Megaera|What is it, Zagreus? You look a little hesitant to go another round with me. Or is it my imagination?
FuryHighRelationship02|Fury High Relationship 02|Zagreus|Well, it's just... can we really keep the personal and the professional completely separate like this, Meg? It's with mixed emotions that I fight you to the death, only to be happy to see you back at the House.
FuryHighRelationship02|Fury High Relationship 02|Megaera|Then learn to keep your emotions in check. You keep them bottled up a while, they'll be that much stronger when it's time to let them out.
FuryEncounterFistWeapon02|Fury Encounter Fist Weapon 02|Megaera|Nice gloves, there, Zagreus. Think you can take me up close with those things? Well within striking distance of my whip.
FuryEncounterFistWeapon02|Fury Encounter Fist Weapon 02|Zagreus|Not wearing them for fashion's sake, here, Meg. You won't mind if I give you my best shot with Malphon here, will you?
FuryEncounterFistWeapon02|Fury Encounter Fist Weapon 02|Megaera|I'd mind if you didn't. Want to get your hands dirty, fine. Let's see it.
FuryAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Fury About Weapon Enchantments 01|Megaera|What happened to your weapon, Zagreus? I sensed its power long before you turned up. That isn't just some Daedalus enchantment on it.
FuryAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Fury About Weapon Enchantments 01|Zagreus|Oh, Stygius and I have been getting much more closely acquainted lately, Meg. Would you care to see the fruits of our healthy symbiotic relationship?
FuryAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Fury About Weapon Enchantments 01|Megaera|You, in a healthy relationship? Why yes, then this I have to see.
FuryKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Keepsake Reaction 01|Megaera|Nice earring, Zagreus. Maybe I should have thought twice before giving you a thing like that.
FuryKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Keepsake Reaction 01|Zagreus|Why, because the gift you generously gave me may end up being instrumental in your own demise? Sounds straight out of one of those tales the mortals like to go spreading around.
FuryKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Keepsake Reaction 01|Megaera|They like it when best-laid plans fall completely to pieces, don't they? You better grow to like it, too.
FuryThanatosKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Thanatos Keepsake Reaction 01|Megaera|I sense something of death upon you, Zagreus. What's that you have, something from Thanatos is it?
FuryThanatosKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Thanatos Keepsake Reaction 01|Zagreus|Oh, this old thing? It's just a listless butterfly Than gave me, which happens to fill me with even more supernatural strength than usual. Don't pay it any mind.
FuryThanatosKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Thanatos Keepsake Reaction 01|Megaera|Not even Thanatos can help you here. But if I ever start a bug collection, I'll know who to call.
FuryLegendaryKeepsakeReaction01_B|Fury Legendary Keepsake Reaction 01 B|Megaera|You know Battie's not going to work here, don't you? I'm definitely not going to help you out of this one.
FuryLegendaryKeepsakeReaction01_B|Fury Legendary Keepsake Reaction 01 B|Zagreus|Come on, Meg, you can do anything if you set your mind to it! Though, don't worry, Battie's just here for the show.
FuryLegendaryKeepsakeReaction01_B|Fury Legendary Keepsake Reaction 01 B|Megaera|Then, let's make it a good one. Come on.
FuryLegendaryKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Legendary Keepsake Reaction 01|Megaera|Your little bat companion not too much to handle, is she, Zagreus? I trust you're taking excellent care of her. Not that she needs your help.
FuryLegendaryKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Legendary Keepsake Reaction 01|Zagreus|Oh she's been positively perfect, thank you, Meg. Especially in how she puts us into contact when I need a hand. I hope it's not too much hassle, helping out from time to time?
FuryLegendaryKeepsakeReaction01|Fury Legendary Keepsake Reaction 01|Megaera|If you were hoping to avoid a hassle, you've definitely come to the wrong place.
FuryLowHealth01|Fury Low Health 01|Megaera|Look at yourself, Zagreus, you are a total mess. Halfway to death or worse. You're making this too easy.
FuryLowHealth01|Fury Low Health 01|Zagreus|Hit a few snags on my way to meet you, Meg. So, if you wouldn't mind going easy on me this one?
FuryLowHealth01|Fury Low Health 01|Megaera|Not on your life or death. But I will kill you quickly, how's that?
FuryLowHealth02|Fury Low Health 02|Megaera|You're wounded, Zagreus. How unbecoming of a god. Not to mention that I have the upper hand.
FuryLowHealth02|Fury Low Health 02|Zagreus|I figured I'd give you a head start this time, so I let the wretched shades bludgeon me repeatedly along the way.
FuryLowHealth02|Fury Low Health 02|Megaera|Fool. If you're half-dead already by the time you get to me, what hope can you possibly have for what lies ahead?
FuryLowHealth03|Fury Low Health 03|Megaera|You look like you had trouble getting to me, Zagreus. Did you try asking for directions on the way?
FuryLowHealth03|Fury Low Health 03|Zagreus|You sound like Hypnos. He's getting to you, isn't he. Isn't he!
FuryLowHealth03|Fury Low Health 03|Megaera|You shut your mouth right now, with that. Come die.
FuryLowHealth04|Fury Low Health 04|Megaera|You're not escaping death this time, here, Zagreus. You ready to go home?
FuryLowHealth04|Fury Low Health 04|Zagreus|No, not just yet, though thanks for asking, Meg. If you intend to force me, know that I am going to resist, with all my might.
FuryLowHealth04|Fury Low Health 04|Megaera|Well I appreciate the warning. Now prepare to die.
FuryEncounter01|Fury Encounter 01|Megaera|Ever stubborn, aren't you. Maybe my whip might make you reconsider whatever it is that you're attempting here.
FuryEncounter01|Fury Encounter 01|Zagreus|Your whip's not been all that persuasive in the past.
FuryEncounter01|Fury Encounter 01|Megaera|Maybe persistence will pay off for both of us. Come, then.
FuryEncounter02|Fury Encounter 02|Megaera|And there you are again. Lord Hades ought to lock you up rather than let you run amok in his domain like this.
FuryEncounter02|Fury Encounter 02|Zagreus|I'm sure he'd welcome all this feedback from you, Meg. Or maybe you're just pining for my father's job?
FuryEncounter02|Fury Encounter 02|Megaera|I have no envy for your father's position. Besides, I happen to enjoy my own responsibilities.
FuryEncounter03|Fury Encounter 03|Megaera|Oh, there you are. Just as I was beginning to think it's been too long since last I killed you, Zag.
FuryEncounter03|Fury Encounter 03|Zagreus|Admit it, Meg. You can't stop thinking about me.
FuryEncounter03|Fury Encounter 03|Megaera|Don't flatter yourself. I think of you in pain. And now there's no more need for the imagination.
FuryEncounter04|Fury Encounter 04|Megaera|Well, Zag? Any last requests this time before I send you home?
FuryEncounter04|Fury Encounter 04|Zagreus|Let's see, how about a swift and painful death, would that be possible?
FuryEncounter04|Fury Encounter 04|Megaera|Be cheeky all you like. You'll get exactly what you asked, and nothing more.
FuryWinStreak01|Fury Win Streak 01|Megaera|*Pff*. And here you are again. You're slow to learn the way of things I see.
FuryWinStreak01|Fury Win Streak 01|Zagreus|I may be slow to learn, but... least I'm rather patient!
FuryWinStreak01|Fury Win Streak 01|Megaera|This talk about your patience is beginning to test mine. Enough! Come on and die.
FuryWinStreak02|Fury Win Streak 02|Megaera|Give up already, Zag. Or I'll keep killing you each time you come this far.
FuryWinStreak02|Fury Win Streak 02|Zagreus|I have some bad news for you, Meg. Little by little, I'm getting stronger.
FuryWinStreak02|Fury Win Streak 02|Megaera|That may be so. But you will never be my equal. Ever. You'd do well to remember that.
FuryWinStreak03|Fury Win Streak 03|Megaera|You're never getting past me, Zagreus.
FuryWinStreak03|Fury Win Streak 03|Zagreus|While that's probably the case... maybe I will this time.
FuryWinStreak03|Fury Win Streak 03|Megaera|Keep telling yourself that. Maybe it'll help take your mind off the pain that is to come.
FuryLoseStreak01|Fury Lose Streak 01|Megaera|Even if you manage to get past me, there's no getting out of Asphodel. You saw what it was like. You really want to go back there?
FuryLoseStreak01|Fury Lose Streak 01|Zagreus|It's not a matter of want. The way out is there in that direction, past the river of flame.
FuryLoseStreak01|Fury Lose Streak 01|Megaera|You're more stubborn than your father. I never thought that such a thing was possible.
FuryLoseStreak02|Fury Lose Streak 02|Megaera|Finally, you're back. You won't get past me like you did last time. Though, I would like to see you try.
FuryPreMatchHighAffinity01|Fury Pre Match High Affinity 01|Megaera|Well, Zag? May I have this dance for old time's sake?
FuryPreMatchHighAffinity02|Fury Pre Match High Affinity 02|Megaera|You ready for me this time, Zagreus? Come on and fight. No holding back.
FuryPreMatchHighAffinity03|Fury Pre Match High Affinity 03|Megaera|I guess we know the drill by now, don't we. Not that I don't enjoy our little arguments, in my own way.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable01|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 01|Megaera|He's here, Alecto. Tis. Let's get him, now.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable02|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 02|Megaera|Prepare yourselves, Sisters. And you, too, Zag.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable03|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 03|Megaera|Together this time, Sisters. Go!
FurySistersUnionRepeatable04|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 04|Megaera|Alecto. Tisiphone. Our guest is here.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable05|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 05|Megaera|He's here. Let's get to work, Sisters.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable06|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 06|Megaera|Well, Sisters? We have a reputation to uphold.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable07|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 07|Megaera|You ready, Sisters? There he is. Now, on my mark.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable09|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 09|Megaera|All right, Sisters, let's show him what we've got.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable10|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 10|Megaera|Alecto, Tis, he's mine. Just back me up.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable11|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 11|Megaera|No time for further talk, now, Sisters. Take him, now.
FurySistersUnionRepeatable12|Fury Sisters Union Repeatable 12|Megaera|No quarter now or ever, Erinyes. Attack!
FurySisterUnionRepeatable01|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 01|Megaera|Are you ready, Sister? Let's take care of him.
FurySisterUnionRepeatable02|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 02|Megaera|Come, Sister, it's time to get to work.
FurySisterUnionRepeatable03|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 03|Megaera|He's here, Sister. Let's go.
FurySisterUnionRepeatable04|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 04|Megaera|It's him. Prepare yourself, Sister.
FurySisterUnionRepeatable05|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 05|Megaera|Alecto and I were just wondering when you'd arrive.
FurySisterUnionRepeatable07|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 07|Megaera|You see, Tisiphone? He's here, just as I said.
FurySisterUnionRepeatable09|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 09|Megaera|Let's go, Sister. Together, we can take him.
FurySisterUnionRepeatable10|Fury Sister Union Repeatable 10|Megaera|...Well, Sister, we'll have to finish catching up some other time.
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity01|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 01|Megaera|I wish it didn't have to be this way.
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity02|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 02|Megaera|Why must we always have to fight.
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity03|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 03|Megaera|It's time we had one of our little fights.
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity04|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 04|Megaera|I so was hoping you'd show up just now.
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity05|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 05|Megaera|Now that you're here, how about a little dance?
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity06|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 06|Megaera|How about we go once more for old time's sake?
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity07|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 07|Megaera|You ready for me, Zagreus?
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity08|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 08|Megaera|And here I was just wondering when you'd show up.
FuryMiscStartHighAffinity09|Fury Misc Start High Affinity 09|Megaera|And there he is at last, the Prince himself.
FuryMiscStartWinStreak01|Fury Misc Start Win Streak 01|Megaera|You've come to die to me again?
FuryMiscStartWinStreak02|Fury Misc Start Win Streak 02|Megaera|I killed you last time, I'll kill you again.
FuryMiscStartWinStreak03|Fury Misc Start Win Streak 03|Megaera|I guess you want to die again?
FuryMiscStartWinStreak04|Fury Misc Start Win Streak 04|Megaera|It seems you haven't learned your lesson yet.
FuryMiscStartWinStreak05|Fury Misc Start Win Streak 05|Megaera|I hope you'll pose more of a threat this time.
FuryMiscStartWinStreak06|Fury Misc Start Win Streak 06|Megaera|You don't seem to learn. Then, come and die.
FuryMiscStartWinStreak07|Fury Misc Start Win Streak 07|Megaera|You aren't getting past me, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak01|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 01|Megaera|I'll never stand aside for you.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak02|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 02|Megaera|I'm back again, and I'll keep coming back.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak03|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 03|Megaera|You'll get past me over my dead body.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak04|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 04|Megaera|I'm never going to back down from you.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak05|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 05|Megaera|I guess we know how this is going to go.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak06|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 06|Megaera|I'm pledged to stand against you, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak07|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 07|Megaera|I will keep coming back, the same as you.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak08|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 08|Megaera|I will not stand aside for you, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak09|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 09|Megaera|Don't know if I can stop you anymore, but I can slow you down.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak10|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 10|Megaera|I'll get you back for what you did last time.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak11|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 11|Megaera|One of these encounters, you'll let your guard down, and I'll kill you again for old time's sake.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak12|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 12|Megaera|Even if I can't stop you... I can get a few good hits in, I'm sure.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak13|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 13|Megaera|I've got a lot of payback to administer here, let me tell you, Zag.
FuryMiscStartLoseStreak14|Fury Misc Start Lose Streak 14|Megaera|*Ungh*, I've practically lost count how many times you beat me in a row here, Zag...
FuryMiscStart01|Fury Misc Start 01|Megaera|I thought you might show up.
FuryMiscStart02|Fury Misc Start 02|Megaera|You're right on schedule.
FuryMiscStart03|Fury Misc Start 03|Megaera|No need for small talk, Zag.
FuryMiscStart04|Fury Misc Start 04|Megaera|Up for another fight I see?
FuryMiscStart05|Fury Misc Start 05|Megaera|What say we get things started.
FuryMiscStart06|Fury Misc Start 06|Megaera|You ready for me, Zagreus?
FuryMiscStart07|Fury Misc Start 07|Megaera|Come on and show me what you've got.
FuryMiscStart08|Fury Misc Start 08|Megaera|Let's go, then, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStart09|Fury Misc Start 09|Megaera|I'm ready for you, Zag.
FuryMiscStart10|Fury Misc Start 10|Megaera|Not one step further, Zag.
FuryMiscStart11|Fury Misc Start 11|Megaera|I can't just let you off without a fight.
FuryMiscStart12|Fury Misc Start 12|Megaera|It's you again, is it.
FuryMiscStart13|Fury Misc Start 13|Megaera|Come all this way again, just to see me.
FuryMiscStart14|Fury Misc Start 14|Megaera|Get on your guard, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStart15A|Fury Misc Start 15 A|Megaera|You're prompt sometimes, I have to give you that.
FuryMiscStart15|Fury Misc Start 15|Megaera|Halt, Zagreus. Not one step further.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship01|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 01|Megaera|Come for another round with me, Zagreus?
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship02|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 02|Megaera|Let's see if you can make it past me, Zag.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship03|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 03|Megaera|No hard feelings, Zagreus. And don't you dare hold back.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship04|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 04|Megaera|One thing I like about you, Zag? You're always right on time.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship06|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 06|Megaera|I hope you're ready for me this time, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship07|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 07|Megaera|Don't think I'm going to go easy on you, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship08|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 08|Megaera|You know it's strictly business here between us, don't you, Zag?
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship09|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 09|Megaera|I expect you to give me the best you've got, Zagreus.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship10|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 10|Megaera|If you so much as think of going easy on me, Zagreus, I'll kill you.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship11|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 11|Megaera|No holding back against me, Zagreus. Certainly not here.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship12|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 12|Megaera|You'll find I don't grow weary of these run-ins with you, Zag.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship13|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 13|Megaera|You know I can't just let you walk away without a fight.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship14|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 14|Megaera|You won't be getting out of here without a dance.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship15|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 15|Megaera|There's nothing you can do to hurt me, Zag. Though I would like to see you try.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship16|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 16|Megaera|I'm starting to enjoy these little outings with you, Zag.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship17|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 17|Megaera|Come on, Zag. Come at me with everything you've got.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship18|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 18|Megaera|Do you want me, Zagreus? Then come and get me.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship19|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 19|Megaera|I'll give you one thing, Zag. You never keep me waiting very long.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship20|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 20|Megaera|You're looking pretty good, there, Zag. Though let me see what I can do.
FuryMiscStartMaxRelationship21|Fury Misc Start Max Relationship 21|Megaera|No pleasure without pain, right, Zagreus?
Fury2SisterUnion01|Fury 2 Sister Union 01|Alecto|You ready, Megaera? Tisiphone? Let's go.
Fury2SisterUnionSingleSis01|Fury 2 Sister Union Single Sis 01|Alecto|Check it out, Sis! The god of trash is here. Let's get to work.
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg01|Duo - Union and Meg (1)|Alecto|*Ugh*, would you just *look *at him! That smug look, that posture, *everything*! Please tell me you're not going soft for this trash-god, Sister.
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg01|Duo - Union and Meg (1)|Megaera|Come on, Alecto. When was the last time that we looked to one another for approval? Besides, as long as we kill him, what do you even care?
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg01|Duo - Union and Meg (1)|Alecto|You know, fair point, there, Sister! Very nicely said. *Let's kill him, now*!
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg02|Duo - Union and Meg (2)|Alecto|Look at this awful piece of trash, come here again to bleed all over our nice shiny floor. Ready to fight my lovely sister, there, redblood?
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg02|Duo - Union and Meg (2)|Megaera|He's not so awful once you get to know him, Sis. Not that it matters for what we're about to do.
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg02|Duo - Union and Meg (2)|Alecto|The both of you disgust me, Meg, you know that? Get it together and *kill *him this time, damn you!
Fury2PactReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Reaction 01|Alecto|You must have gone and signed a Pact! Isn't that right, redblood? Tell me right now.
Fury2PactReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Reaction 01|Zagreus|Well, as a matter of fact, I have. Though I don't see how that's any business of yours, Alecto.
Fury2PactReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Reaction 01|Alecto|I like working *alone*! And you don't see me doing that, right now, do you? So I would say it's my business, all right. Along with killing *you*!
Fury2PactDisabledReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Disabled Reaction 01|Alecto|*Whew*, I thought I'd never get some quiet time again, you know, redblood? That damned Pact you stupidly agreed to, making me work with my sisters again. I'll get you for that!
Fury2PactDisabledReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Disabled Reaction 01|Zagreus|I'm sensing a pattern that it really doesn't take much for you to have something to *get *me for, does it?
Fury2PactDisabledReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Disabled Reaction 01|Alecto|Oh, that's rich! How smart of you, you're *smart*! Know what? I'll get you for that, too.
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Alecto|*Ah, hah hah, hohohohohhh. *Finally. I've been waiting for this! Really.
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Zagreus|You must be one of Megaera's lovely sisters, I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Waiting for what, exactly?
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Alecto|...So sick of, you know, doing my regular job, uninterrupted. Not having to clean up Meg's messes!
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Zagreus|I get the feeling we're starting off on the wrong foot.
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Alecto|Anyway. I always wanted to kill a god. You'll have to do.
Fury2PostEnding01|Fury 2 Post Ending 01|Alecto|Heard rumblings about some news back at your daddy's House, redblood. So his illustrious abducted Queen, she's come back home?!
Fury2PostEnding01|Fury 2 Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Wait, how do you even know all that? And should you really be talking about the Queen that way?
Fury2PostEnding01|Fury 2 Post Ending 01|Alecto|I don't answer to her! She can come and go as she wants for all I care. But you want to know who can't?! Yeah, you.
Fury2PostEnding02|Fury 2 Post Ending 02|Alecto|I got to ask, how come you keep on showing up, redblood? I thought you would have had enough beatings by now.
Fury2PostEnding02|Fury 2 Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Well, you know, I've come to enjoy these visits with you so much, Alecto, that I've made it something of a regular routine. Form good habits, and then stick to them, I say!
Fury2PostEnding02|Fury 2 Post Ending 02|Alecto|You call this a good habit, huh? Maybe for me, it is. Well, come here all you like, and I will be here waiting, *every single time*! About once every three times, anyway.
Fury2PostEpilogue01|Fury 2 Post Epilogue 01|Alecto|Heard you had a real bash down in your daddy's House, redblood. So sorry I couldn't make it. Next time, though, all right?
Fury2PostEpilogue01|Fury 2 Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Next time, definitely, Alecto. We missed you for sure and wish you could have made it!
Fury2PostEpilogue01|Fury 2 Post Epilogue 01|Alecto|*Hohoho*, I'm sure you did. But, you know, work comes first! So let's get busy.
Fury2EndOfDiscussion01|Fury 2 End Of Discussion 01|Alecto|Hey, redblood. I have done a lot of thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that I want you *never *to speak to me again. *Ever*. Got that?
Fury2EndOfDiscussion01|Fury 2 End Of Discussion 01|Zagreus|...*Erm*, I don't know how to respond to what you said without directly disobeying your request, Alecto. But for future reference, fine, I'll bite.
Fury2EndOfDiscussion01|Fury 2 End Of Discussion 01|Alecto|You'll *die*! There's no use standing here flapping our gums when we could cut to killing one another right away. Come on!
Fury2LowHealth01|Fury 2 Low Health 01|Alecto|*Ahh*, look at you, redblood. You're practically already dead! Now that's no fun at all.
Fury2LowHealth01|Fury 2 Low Health 01|Zagreus|Sorry to disappoint you, Alecto. I know you enjoy being responsible for a hundred percent of my bloodshed.
Fury2LowHealth01|Fury 2 Low Health 01|Alecto|Oh, that's all right, no hard feelings at all! You just be sure to get in better health before next I get to kill you, hm?
Fury2LowHealth02|Fury 2 Low Health 02|Alecto|You know I smelled your blood from three chambers away? Hope you saved some of it for me.
Fury2LowHealth02|Fury 2 Low Health 02|Zagreus|I've saved some of my blood, yes! Though I was thinking I'd hang onto it for now, if you don't mind.
Fury2LowHealth02|Fury 2 Low Health 02|Alecto|Do I look like someone who doesn't mind, trash god? I'll take your blood, however much you've got.
Fury2LowHealth03|Fury 2 Low Health 03|Alecto|What's the matter, redblood? You look a little paler than usual. Been bleeding much, having to get this far?
Fury2LowHealth03|Fury 2 Low Health 03|Zagreus|I ran into some setbacks, if you have to know. But don't worry, I'm sure I've plenty left to bleed.
Fury2LowHealth03|Fury 2 Low Health 03|Alecto|Oh *whew*, that's a relief all right! I was so worried that I wasn't going to be the one to kill you this time.
Fury2LowHealth04|Fury 2 Low Health 04|Alecto|You're looking pretty beat already, there, redblood. So let's finish you off.
Fury2LowHealth05|Fury 2 Low Health 05|Alecto|Next time, don't you go losing so much blood before you get here, trash! I like to take it out of you myself.
Fury2MiscEncounter01|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 01|Alecto|You're no god! You're nothing but a piece of trash. Born into all of this. And you don't even want it!
Fury2MiscEncounter01|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 01|Zagreus|You seem to have me all figured out. And here I thought we were still getting to know each other.
Fury2MiscEncounter01|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 01|Alecto|*Tsch*. Well. You want to know what I want? Here, I'll show you.
Fury2MiscEncounter02|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 02|Alecto|You know what I like about you? The way you bleed. *Mmm*.
Fury2MiscEncounter02|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 02|Zagreus|That... is not the type of flattery I'm used to. You're making me a bit uncomfortable, I'll have you know.
Fury2MiscEncounter02|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 02|Alecto|Never met a god that bleeds like you. Red. Like a worthless mortal. Come on! Let's bleed you dry.
Fury2MiscEncounter03|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 03|Alecto|Let's get to work, redblood, what do you say? Me, I say you've kept this girl waiting long enough.
Fury2MiscEncounter03|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 03|Zagreus|Well, I say I don't appreciate you calling me redblood. You're making me rather self-conscious about it, you know.
Fury2MiscEncounter03|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 03|Alecto|*Oh, hoho*, you're funny. But you'll break. They always do.
Fury2MiscEncounter04|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 04|Alecto|I have got to admit, you are really frustrating, you know, redblood? What is it going to take to make you scream, hm?
Fury2MiscEncounter04|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 04|Zagreus|What, you mean to say Meg never told you? And here I thought you two were close.
Fury2MiscEncounter04|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 04|Alecto|*Ehh*, we'll find out. I've got plenty of ideas left I've been meaning to try.
Fury2MiscEncounter05|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 05|Alecto|You know something, redblood? In retrospect, I should have known this wasn't going to be a quick job.
Fury2MiscEncounter05|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 05|Zagreus|They say both gods and mortals are notoriously poor at estimating how long it takes to get anything done.
Fury2MiscEncounter05|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 05|Alecto|Normally when I'm on the job, they grovel, then they scream. They shut up eventually, but not you. At least, not yet.
Fury2MiscEncounter06|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 06|Alecto|*Huh*! You really must like pain an awful lot, redblood. Or maybe it's just me.
Fury2MiscEncounter06|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 06|Zagreus|You see, Alecto? Turns out we do have a common interest after all.
Fury2MiscEncounter06|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 06|Alecto|Did you just--? Don't you *ever *compare yourself to me again, you trash. You want more pain, I'm happy to oblige.
Fury2MiscEncounter07|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 07|Alecto|I've got a lot to be thankful for, you know, redblood? Your daddy could have shut you in the lowest pits, and then we never would have met!
Fury2MiscEncounter07|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 07|Zagreus|Perish the thought, Alecto. What would you have done with yourself if not for all our fated encounters?
Fury2MiscEncounter07|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 07|Alecto|I don't know! I mean, before we met, I flayed all sorts of other trash down here! But lately I've been keeping them waiting, because of you.
Fury2MiscEncounter08|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 08|Alecto|Good job, redblood! You made it all this way! But, I have got to send you back to daddy, now. Nothing personal!
Fury2MiscEncounter08|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 08|Zagreus|Wish you could join me, Alecto. Want me to put in a good word with Father next time, so you can come visit us at the House yourself?
Fury2MiscEncounter08|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 08|Alecto|Oh, you know, I'd rather have my eyes put out, but thanks for offering! Now, time to head on home.
Fury2MiscEncounter09|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 09|Alecto|You know, redblood, my appointments usually don't come to *me*, much less again and again! Think I'm here to show you a good time, huh?!
Fury2MiscEncounter09|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 09|Zagreus|Alecto, I just like to see you menacingly smile. And, hey, having to deal with you now and again beats having to fight Meg all the time.
Fury2MiscEncounter09|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 09|Alecto|*Whaa*?! You think dealing with *me *beats dealing with that *weakling*? *Graaaah*!
Fury2MiscEncounter10|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 10|Alecto|How many times is it going to take, redblood? *How many*?! Tell me! How can you stand running into me like this, over and over?
Fury2MiscEncounter10|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 10|Zagreus|Well, habits can be hard to break. As for how many times, I've really no idea. Though I guess there's one way to find out.
Fury2MiscEncounter10|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 10|Alecto|I'll give you one thing... I like it when my prey bites back. Come on, let's see some blood again.
Fury2AboutTisiphoneSpeech01|Fury 2 About Tisiphone Speech 01|Alecto|Tisiphone's started to say the strangest things, lately, redblood. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Fury2AboutTisiphoneSpeech01|Fury 2 About Tisiphone Speech 01|Zagreus|Oh, don't fret. I was just trying to help her expand her somewhat limited vocabulary.
Fury2AboutTisiphoneSpeech01|Fury 2 About Tisiphone Speech 01|Alecto|Stay out of her head!! You really think she's got something to learn from you? Learn to shut up from her!
Fury2AboutMegaeraRelationship01|Fury 2 About Megaera Relationship 01|Alecto|*Eugh*, still can't believe Megaera got mixed up with you, redblood. For all her weakness, I always thought at least she took her job here seriously. *Eh*, live and learn!
Fury2AboutMegaeraRelationship01|Fury 2 About Megaera Relationship 01|Zagreus|Not interested in your nasty remarks about her, Alecto. Though if you keep them up, I'm warning you, I might get mad.
Fury2AboutMegaeraRelationship01|Fury 2 About Megaera Relationship 01|Alecto|*Ohh*, you might get *mad*? Defend Megaera's honor, since she's far too weak to do it her damn self? You think she's so pure! *Hahaha*! You're disgusting! Both of you.
Fury2WinStreak01|Fury 2 Win Streak 01|Alecto|Oh hey, redblood! You're back for more. I like that stubborn stupidness about you, honestly. If only I could keep you alive even longer this time.
Fury2WinStreak01|Fury 2 Win Streak 01|Zagreus|What, you planning to kill me with insults this time?
Fury2WinStreak01|Fury 2 Win Streak 01|Alecto|Haven't decided how just yet. This girl likes a little spontaneity.
Fury2WinStreak02|Fury 2 Win Streak 02|Alecto|*Huh*! Normally my marks don't make a habit of seeking me out again after I'm through with them.
Fury2WinStreak02|Fury 2 Win Streak 02|Zagreus|I can imagine that, it's just, I've really come to appreciate these little back-and-forth exchanges that we have.
Fury2WinStreak02|Fury 2 Win Streak 02|Alecto|*Ugh*, I do so hate to let you down like this, redblood. But you're just not my type. Maybe I'll finally get it through your head this time.
Fury2LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Lose Streak 01|Alecto|Know something, redblood? Try as I might, I still have not forgiven you for beating me last time. Call it a crippling character flaw, I don't know...
Fury2LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Lose Streak 01|Zagreus|Forgiveness can take time. Though self-reflection is a healthy step. We're making progress!
Fury2LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Lose Streak 01|Alecto|You think we're making progress? Here? *Ah, hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, *why you piece of trash! I'll show you progress.
Fury2LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Lose Streak 02|Alecto|Redblood, I'm getting awful sick of seeing your smug face, time, after time, after time.
Fury2LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Lose Streak 02|Zagreus|Have you given any thought to just... leaving me alone, and going back to wherever it is you came from?
Fury2LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Lose Streak 02|Alecto|You see? That is *exactly *what I mean. To think that Megaera had to put up with you for, I don't know how long.
Fury2LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Damn you for this, redblood. You're making me look bad, you know? Making me *feel *bad.
Fury2LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Lose Streak 03|Zagreus|Alecto, I didn't ask you to repeatedly attempt to kill me. How did you expect me to respond?
Fury2LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Lose Streak 03|Alecto|*Ah-hahah-hahaha, hahah*, you do know what happens when you make me *feel *bad, don't you...?
Fury2LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Lose Streak 04|Alecto|*Huh*, it's the god of trash, come once again to filthy up this place! You're getting real predictable, you know.
Fury2LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Lose Streak 04|Zagreus|Considering I beat you last we met, I'd be much more concerned with your predictability than mine.
Fury2LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Lose Streak 04|Alecto|Don't want to hear it from you, trash! Just want to see you bleed. Now you come here!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable01|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 01|Alecto|*Ohh*, there he is, sisters. It's time to get to work.
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable03|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 03|Alecto|Let's tear him into shreds, sisters, come on!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable04|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 04|Alecto|Hey, check it out, sisters, he's back. You ready?
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable05|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 05|Alecto|He's come crawling back again, sisters. Let's get him, then.
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable06|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 06|Alecto|All right, sisters! Don't screw this up for me!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable07|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 07|Alecto|I'm taking point against this trash, sisters. You back me up.
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable08|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 08|Alecto|All three of us against *this *trash, sisters? All right!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable09|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 09|Alecto|The three Furies up against the trash god! What a fight!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable09|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 09|Alecto|Oh, *hohohohoho*, look at him, sisters! Don't you just want to whip him all to shreds?!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable10|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 10|Alecto|Much as I love chatting with you, Meg, Tisiphone... our prey is here.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable01|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 01|Alecto|You ready, Sis? This redblood's nothing to the both of us.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable03|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 03|Alecto|Well, Sis, what do you say we get started on him?
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable04|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 04|Alecto|There he is, Sis! I'm ready if you're ready.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable05|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 05|Alecto|All right, Sister! Let's rip him all to shreds!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable06|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 06|Alecto|You ready for him, Sister? I most definitely am!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable07|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 07|Alecto|You're never getting through the both of us without losing a lot of blood, trash god.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable08|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 08|Alecto|My sis and I, we're going to tear you limb from limb, redblood!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable09|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 09|Alecto|Think you can scoot right past the both of us, trash god?!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable10|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 10|Alecto|All right, Sis! You just back me up against this trash!
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 01|Alecto|I'll just keep killing you, redblood. Not that I mind!
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 02|Alecto|What are we going to do with you this time, now, hm?
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 03|Alecto|I'm impressed, redblood. You really never learn.
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 04|Alecto|Turns out, killing the god of trash never gets old.
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak05|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 05|Alecto|How would you like to die this time, redblood? Here, let me guess.
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak06|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 06|Alecto|You just don't get it, do you? Though I bet I can make you learn.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 01|Alecto|I'm getting real sick of you, trash god. Come on!
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 02|Alecto|Bad news for you, redblood. I like dying.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Come on, redblood, let's see you kill me again!
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 04|Alecto|You're stuck with me forever, trash. Remember that.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak05|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 05|Alecto|I'm really starting to hate you. You know that, redblood?
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak06|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 06|Alecto|Why if it isn't the god of trash himself. I'm so honored.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak07|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 07|Alecto|Good news for you, I'm in a real bad mood right now.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak08|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 08|Alecto|Been looking forward to this chance to get you back, redblood.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak09|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 09|Alecto|Heard you were in the area, and thought I'd take another stab at killing you.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak10|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 10|Alecto|Redblood, I really don't appreciate what happened here last time.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak11|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 11|Alecto|You might get through me, trash god, but I'm going to spill your blood before you do!
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak12|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 12|Alecto|Long as I slow you down, redblood, I've done my job.
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 01|Alecto|You think just 'cause you got through Megaera, you'll get through me?
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 02|Alecto|Your daddy never should have given Megaera this job.
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Megaera couldn't make it, redblood, so it's me and you.
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 04|Alecto|*Hah*! It's Megaera's hot mess. Let's clean you up.
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 01|Alecto|You got Tisiphone, so what. Now I'll get you.
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 02|Alecto|You mess with Tis, redblood, you mess with me, get it?
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Tisiphone's been having problems with you, huh. Let's see if I can help.
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 04|Alecto|Nobody messes with Tisiphone but me, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart01|Fury 2 Misc Start 01|Alecto|I'm going to enjoy this, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart02|Fury 2 Misc Start 02|Alecto|Just when I was beginning to feel bored.
Fury2MiscStart03|Fury 2 Misc Start 03|Alecto|I'm going to tear you limb from limb, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart04|Fury 2 Misc Start 04|Alecto|The Fates must want to spill your blood as much as I do.
Fury2MiscStart05|Fury 2 Misc Start 05|Alecto|Time to die, again, redblood. Let's get to killing you.
Fury2MiscStart06|Fury 2 Misc Start 06|Alecto|This job never gets old, redblood, I can assure you that.
Fury2MiscStart07|Fury 2 Misc Start 07|Alecto|Well if it isn't the god of trash himself. Come die.
Fury2MiscStart08|Fury 2 Misc Start 08|Alecto|Good, I was getting real tired waiting around to kill you.
Fury2MiscStart09|Fury 2 Misc Start 09|Alecto|*Aww*, you came back all this way! I'm flattered, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart10|Fury 2 Misc Start 10|Alecto|Got some kind of deathwish, don't you. Fine.
Fury2MiscStart11|Fury 2 Misc Start 11|Alecto|Oh, thank the Fates I get to deal with you this time.
Fury2MiscStart12|Fury 2 Misc Start 12|Alecto|Let's see what you can do, redblood. Come on!
Fury2MiscStart13A|Fury 2 Misc Start 13 A|Alecto|Well! Look who's back. The god of trash, himself.
Fury2MiscStart13|Fury 2 Misc Start 13|Alecto|Get ready for a bunch of pain and suffering, trash god.
Fury2MiscStart14|Fury 2 Misc Start 14|Alecto|Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it right there, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart15|Fury 2 Misc Start 15|Alecto|Been waiting here to beat you to a bloody pulp, redblood!
Fury2MiscStart16|Fury 2 Misc Start 16|Alecto|Don't even open that damn mouth of yours, redblood. Except to scream.
Fury2MiscStart17|Fury 2 Misc Start 17|Alecto|You must like pain, or something, don't you, there, redblood?
Fury2MiscStart18|Fury 2 Misc Start 18|Alecto|Somebody's dying soon, redblood! *Ohh*, I can't wait.
Fury2MiscStart19|Fury 2 Misc Start 19|Alecto|Come give me everything you've got, trash god!
Fury2MiscStart20|Fury 2 Misc Start 20|Alecto|Let's see what you're made of, trash god! Come on!
Fury2MiscStart21|Fury 2 Misc Start 21|Alecto|Looks like my prayers to the god of trash have finally been answered, huh?!
Fury2MiscStart22|Fury 2 Misc Start 22|Alecto|What's the matter, there, redblood? Gone awful quiet! Did I hurt your feelings, *huh*?
Fury2MiscStart23|Fury 2 Misc Start 23|Alecto|*Ohh*, I'm going to bleed you till you're dry.
Fury2MiscStart24|Fury 2 Misc Start 24|Alecto|You want to mess with me *again*, redblood?! Well then, *come on*!
Fury2MiscStart25|Fury 2 Misc Start 25|Alecto|How is it possible I am so sick of you, but never sick of *killing *you, redblood?
Fury2MiscStart26|Fury 2 Misc Start 26|Alecto|Step on it, redblood! I've got lots of other trash to whip, you know!
Fury2MiscStart27|Fury 2 Misc Start 27|Alecto|You want through that door back there, it's going to cost you blood!
Fury2MiscStart28|Fury 2 Misc Start 28|Alecto|Megaera's not just weak, she's got bad taste to match.
Fury2MiscStart29B|Fury 2 Misc Start 29 B|Alecto|Oh good, I was just itching for a live one, here, trash god.
Fury2MiscStart29A|Fury 2 Misc Start 29 A|Alecto|Live or die, your daddy doesn't care, redblood!
Fury2MiscStart29|Fury 2 Misc Start 29|Alecto|Good thing your daddy hates you, or I wouldn't have the pleasure here, redblood!
Fury2MiscStart30|Fury 2 Misc Start 30|Alecto|I'm real sick of waiting here, so how about we make this *real quick*, redblood!
Fury2MiscStart31|Fury 2 Misc Start 31|Alecto|Nothing like nice, fresh blood to warm things up in here, I always say!
Fury2MiscStart32|Fury 2 Misc Start 32|Alecto|When I heard you were coming through, redblood, I told my sisters I would see you here.
Fury2MiscStart33|Fury 2 Misc Start 33|Alecto|*Ohh*, we are going to enjoy this, here, redblood!
Fury2MiscStart34|Fury 2 Misc Start 34|Alecto|Heard you were in the area and volunteered for this, trash god.
Fury2MiscStart35|Fury 2 Misc Start 35|Alecto|Time to spill it for me once again, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart36|Fury 2 Misc Start 36|Alecto|I'll send you screaming home to daddy, now come on!!
Fury3SisterUnionSingleSis01_A|Fury 3 Sister Union Single Sis 01 A|Alecto|You mess with Tis, redblood, you mess with me, get it?
Fury3SisterUnionSingleSis01_A|Fury 3 Sister Union Single Sis 01 A|Tisiphone|*Mmmuurrderrerrr*...!
Fury3FirstAppearance|Fury 3 First Appearance|Tisiphone|*Mmmm... mmmurderer...*
Fury3FirstAppearance|Fury 3 First Appearance|Zagreus|Hey, you must be one of Meg's sisters! Nice to finally meet you. My name's Zagreus. Not *Murderer*. Definitely not.
Fury3FirstAppearance|Fury 3 First Appearance|Tisiphone|Murderer... *mmmmurderrrerrrrrrrr...!*
Fury3FirstAppearance|Fury 3 First Appearance|Zagreus|*Erm*... look, I've done some things that maybe aren't great, but I am very, very sure I haven't murdered anyone.
Fury3FirstAppearance|Fury 3 First Appearance|Tisiphone|*Mmmmmurderrrerrrrrrrr*...!
Fury3PostEnding01|Fury 3 Post Ending 01|Zagreus|I'm here on official business this time, Tisiphone, so, *uh*... stand aside! Although, I guess the whole point of this job is that you're meant to try and stop me anyway, isn't that right?
Fury3PostEnding01|Fury 3 Post Ending 01|Tisiphone|Mmm, hrr-hrr-*hrrdderrr*...
Fury3PostEpilogue01|Fury 3 Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Oh, sorry that you couldn't make the feast back at the House, Tisiphone. Though, I don't really think it was your kind of scene. Although, Ares was there, he's probably done some murders, right?
Fury3PostEpilogue01|Fury 3 Post Epilogue 01|Tisiphone|Murrddderrrr? Murrdderrr. *Murddder*!
Fury3Encounter01|Fury 3 Encounter 01|Tisiphone|*Mmmmurrr*... derr...?
Fury3Encounter01|Fury 3 Encounter 01|Zagreus|*Erm*... how about, no? No murder. No murder!
Fury3Encounter01|Fury 3 Encounter 01|Tisiphone|*Mmmmuurderrr....*
Fury3Encounter02|Fury 3 Encounter 02|Tisiphone|Murder...? Murder, murrrder...!
Fury3Encounter02|Fury 3 Encounter 02|Zagreus|I was really hoping we could change the subject. Please?
Fury3Encounter02|Fury 3 Encounter 02|Tisiphone|Muurderer... *muuurrderer*!
Fury3Encounter03|Fury 3 Encounter 03|Tisiphone|Mmm... mmm.... mmmrrrr....!
Fury3Encounter03|Fury 3 Encounter 03|Zagreus|Let me guess. Murder? Murderer, perhaps? One of those two.
Fury3Encounter03|Fury 3 Encounter 03|Tisiphone|Mmm, mmmurder... mmmurder!!
Fury3Encounter04|Fury 3 Encounter 04|Tisiphone|Mmmrrrrr... mmurrr, derrr....
Fury3Encounter04|Fury 3 Encounter 04|Zagreus|Please, I'm not a murderer, you don't have to do this.
Fury3Encounter04|Fury 3 Encounter 04|Tisiphone|Murderer. Muurrdererrr....
Fury3Encounter05|Fury 3 Encounter 05|Tisiphone|Murdererrr... murder, murder, *murder*!
Fury3Encounter05|Fury 3 Encounter 05|Zagreus|We're not getting through to one another, are we. I'm sorry that it has to be this way.
Fury3Encounter05|Fury 3 Encounter 05|Tisiphone|Murderer. *Murdererrr*!!
Fury3Encounter06|Fury 3 Encounter 06|Tisiphone|Murder? *Murder*...? Murder....
Fury3Encounter06|Fury 3 Encounter 06|Zagreus|I don't understand. But I'm not who you think I am. My father sent you to stop me, that's all.
Fury3Encounter06|Fury 3 Encounter 06|Tisiphone|Murderer... murderer! *Murderer*!
Fury3Encounter07|Fury 3 Encounter 07|Tisiphone|Mrrr... murr.. derr... *murrdderr*!
Fury3Encounter07|Fury 3 Encounter 07|Zagreus|No, murder. Zagreus. My name is Zagreus! Can you say that, Tisiphone? No murder. *Zagreus*!
Fury3Encounter07|Fury 3 Encounter 07|Tisiphone|Murr... derr... *zerrr*....
Fury3Encounter08|Fury 3 Encounter 08|Tisiphone|Mm, murrr... derr... zerrr!
Fury3Encounter08|Fury 3 Encounter 08|Zagreus|You really did say *murderzer*, didn't you! That's progress! Zagreus! I'm Zagreus, I'm not a murderer! Can you say Zagreus?
Fury3Encounter08|Fury 3 Encounter 08|Tisiphone|Derr... zerr... zahh... zahh, *graaahh*!
Fury3Encounter09|Fury 3 Encounter 09|Tisiphone|Zerr... znnhh... zrrrnggh...!
Fury3Encounter09|Fury 3 Encounter 09|Zagreus|Do you remember me, Tisiphone? My name is Zagreus. Prince of the Underworld? Pretty close with Megaera, I guess. Try saying Zagreus again for me?
Fury3Encounter09|Fury 3 Encounter 09|Tisiphone|Zrrnngh... zaahh... zahh... gree... mrrsss...?
Fury3Encounter10|Fury 3 Encounter 10|Tisiphone|*Zzaaahhh... durrr... err*... Zzahh... durr.
Fury3Encounter10|Fury 3 Encounter 10|Zagreus|Oh, you're so close, Tisiphone! Remember, Zagreus? That's me. I'm not your enemy, you know, don't you know that? I'm only Zagreus!
Fury3Encounter10|Fury 3 Encounter 10|Tisiphone|...Zzzzzaaahhh... gree... usss.... Zzaagreeusss! *Zaagreuss*!!
Fury3Encounter11|Fury 3 Encounter 11|Tisiphone|*Zzzaaggreussss*.... mm... murrdererr....
Fury3Encounter11|Fury 3 Encounter 11|Zagreus|No. Wait. Just the first part. No murderer. Just Zagreus. Or... let's see, how about... *happy*? Can you say *happy*?
Fury3Encounter11|Fury 3 Encounter 11|Tisiphone|Mmrrr... *Zzzrrderrrerrr*....
Fury3Encounter12|Fury 3 Encounter 12|Tisiphone|Murdderr... Zzaagreusss... *murddererrr*...
Fury3Encounter12|Fury 3 Encounter 12|Zagreus|*Erm*, well... let's try again with *happy*, how about that? Happy? No murder, only happy. Come on, now!
Fury3Encounter12|Fury 3 Encounter 12|Tisiphone|Murderr... murderr *Zzagreusss*!
Fury3Encounter13|Fury 3 Encounter 13|Tisiphone|Mmmmurdde*rerrr*... znnnhh... zrrrnnggh...
Fury3Encounter13|Fury 3 Encounter 13|Zagreus|*Eugh*, I guess the *happy *thing just isn't doing it for you. Though, maybe trying to kill me like this is as close as you can get. You learned my name at least, that's something, right?
Fury3Encounter13|Fury 3 Encounter 13|Tisiphone|*Murrddderr... Zzaagreusss*...
Fury3Encounter14|Fury 3 Encounter 14|Tisiphone|Mmmuurdderrr... *murrdderrrerrrrr*....
Fury3Encounter14|Fury 3 Encounter 14|Zagreus|...Then we're back to square one. Look, I was just trying to get through to you with all the Zagreus and happy stuff. But, if you can understand any of this, Tisiphone, I think you're all right, just the way you are. Friends?
Fury3Encounter14|Fury 3 Encounter 14|Tisiphone|...Zzrrngh... zrrnnggh... *zzrrdderrrerrr!*...
Fury3Encounter15|Fury 3 Encounter 15|Tisiphone|Zzz, zzaa... *Zaaggreus? *Mmurderrrer?
Fury3Encounter15|Fury 3 Encounter 15|Zagreus|Hey, *uhh*, any second thoughts, by any chance, about the whole *happy *thing? Just making sure.

TheseusExtremeMeasures01|Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Theseus|*Ah, hahaha*, it's finally time, Asterius. He's here! Aren't you, now, you vile, insignificant hellspawn? Prepare now to be overrun!!
TheseusExtremeMeasures01|Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|Oh, this is unfair... that's a bronze-plated Macedonian Tau-Lambda! What's an obnoxious bellyacher like you doing with the most durable chariot created, to date?
TheseusExtremeMeasures01|Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Theseus|*Pah*! You don't deserve to know. Suffice it that Asterius and I were handsomely rewarded once again. And we shall not hesitate to exploit our hard-fought spoils against *you*!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds02|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 02|Theseus|He would pit you against me, Asterius. I can see it in his mis-matched eyes! I cannot shake the terrible vision that, someday or night, it shall be me, standing alone here, whilst you...? Whilst you take sides against me! With that *fiend*!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds02|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 02|Zagreus|Asterius, about that, please consider it a standing offer, if you like. I'd rather have you as a friend than as a foe. Not sure that I can say the same for Theseus, of course.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds02|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 02|Theseus|*You poisonous worm*! I knew you had a more sinister trick at play, because your fighting style certainly is of no concern just on its own! Are there truly no depths to which you would not stoop?!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 03 A|Theseus|...I'm telling you, you're *wrong*, Asterius! He is no *royalty*, most certainly not any *I *would recognize! He's but a nameless, long-forgotten minor god born of the depths, and bound to stay in them!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 03 A|Minotaur|I, too, once was berated by such words, king. We've faced this enemy how many times? And in my estimation, he's fought bravely, here.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 03 A|Theseus|*Bravely*?! Hiding behind those pillars is what you call *bravely*, Asterius? We shall have to discuss this strange lapse of judgment after we achieve our victory!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A|Theseus|I hope you're perfectly pleased with yourself, hellspawn. Because Asterius has been quite cross with me! Such as he is. He says I have misjudged the likes of you! *Outrageousness*.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A|Minotaur|You don't hear me, king. We still have a lot to learn about this foe. Each time, he's differently equipped. Weapons, god-given abilities, and such. Despite our efforts... it's been difficult to read his strategies.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A|Theseus|And now, you're saying I can't fight, Asterius? Even though I had no difficulty besting *you *within that maze of yours?! Come on, let's do this fight!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A|Theseus|Well, worm! Come fight us, I suppose. And take fullest advantage of the havoc that you sowed! We are no team! We're merely two combatants, simultaneously booked to be here, now.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A|Minotaur|King, I think you are over-reacting, here. Try to be reasonable. And be more considerate about my point of view. Don't think I am asking for too much.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A|Theseus|You're asking the impossible of me! But, let us fight. And let us lose, I'm sure, because if we are not a team, what are we, then, Asterius...?
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05Extra_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 Extra A|Minotaur|You'll have to excuse the Champion, there, short one. He hasn't been himself. Though he'll still fight you to the death, I'm sure.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05Extra_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 Extra A|Zagreus|That's good, because you had me worried for a moment, there. Hey maybe I can knock some sense back into him, what do you think?
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05Extra_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 Extra A|Minotaur|I'm not so sure. I've tried. But I know better than to underestimate you. Fight us, then.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A|Theseus|Please fight with me, again, Asterius. I mean, just like before! You must forgive me my indecencies of late. This blasted fiend! His lies and treachery get right under my skin. Or the phantasmagorical equivalent!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A|Minotaur|Swear something to me, king. That you'll discard your fears about our bond. The short one here is never going to break it. He doesn't even understand it. The only one who can break it is you, yourself.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A|Theseus|I... oh, my dear friend, Asterius. I see, of course, you're right, you're right. *You're right*! And I solemnly do swear to you, indeed, that I shall never again doubt our brotherhood! Nor shall I ever listen to this fiend! Together, now and always!!
TheseusExtremeMeasures02|Theseus Extreme Measures 02|Theseus|Come forth, blackguard, and you shall soon be crushed under the massive wheels of the finest chariot the world has ever known!
TheseusExtremeMeasures02|Theseus Extreme Measures 02|Zagreus|You only have that chariot because of me, you know. It's all because of a condition of the Pact of Punishment! Nothing you did or earned. So drop the act!
TheseusExtremeMeasures02|Theseus Extreme Measures 02|Theseus|*Hahahahah*, what?! You claim to be my benefactor, when in truth, you are my figuratively mortal enemy?! I'll do the chariot-equivalent of trample you!
TheseusExtremeMeasures03|Theseus Extreme Measures 03|Theseus|Come, blackguard! And be crushed beneath the raging wheelwork of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda, once again!
TheseusExtremeMeasures03|Theseus Extreme Measures 03|Zagreus|Theseus, you do know you look even more ridiculous than normal wearing that mask? I get the chariot and the unsporting weaponry, but why wear *that *thing?
TheseusExtremeMeasures03|Theseus Extreme Measures 03|Theseus|*Bah! *This blessed mask was crafted by great Daedalus, himself! A work of art, and my entitled claim as champion! What has he ever done for you?!
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Theseus|Well now, Asterius, he's returned! And this time, we shall have to vanquish him without the aid of our divine armor! A worthy challenge, no?
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Minotaur|Be cautious not to underestimate him, king. He has proved troublesome before.
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Theseus|Nonsense, my friend! For how can one underestimate that which deserves no esteem whatsoever?! Together, now, *attack*!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon01|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 01|Theseus|Well, you senseless monster, I suspect you're not so pleased with yourself, now! Behold!! For my glorious chariot has been restored!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon01|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 01|Zagreus|Oh, indeed, nice work! Though must have cost a fortune in gemstones and diamonds, restoring an old Macedonian. I thought it was totaled after last time.
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon01|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 01|Theseus|The only thing which shall be totaled here, you heartless property-destroying scourge, is *you yourself*! Asterius!! Together, let us break him!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon02|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 02|Theseus|My chariot and I stand ready for you, daemon! And I assume Asterius, as well! I feel it in my phantom heart, we shall not fall to you this time!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon02|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 02|Zagreus|You know, my opinion of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda has fallen precipitously of late. Though perhaps it's not the chariot but the driver.
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon02|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 02|Theseus|*Silence*!! Show me a finer chariot-driver anywhere within Elysium, why, you cannot! I'll run you down for such an insult to my pride!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon03|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 03|Theseus|Ready yourself and your fine armor, friend Asterius! I shall drive circles around him, whilst you dispatch him with your mighty axe!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon03|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 03|Zagreus|Your strategy might work a little better if you didn't shout it loud enough for me to hear. Though I have to say I'm impressed you can drive, fight, and shout all at the same time.
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon03|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 03|Theseus|And *I*, fiend, am impressed that *you *yet live and breathe! A temporary state Asterius and I shall soon alleviate! *To war*!!
TheseusWithAsterius01|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (1)|Minotaur|He's here, king. Activating armor. It's fortunate repairs on your chariot were completed in time.
TheseusWithAsterius01|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (1)|Theseus|Nonsense, my friend! We could defeat this vile hellspawn with or without the additional divine protection we've been granted here! Get him!
TheseusPoseidonQuestReaction01|Theseus Poseidon Quest Reaction 01|Theseus|Avert your eyes, fiend, lest the shining bronzework of the Macedonian should strike you blind! We are prepared to face your devilry!
TheseusPoseidonQuestReaction01|Theseus Poseidon Quest Reaction 01|Zagreus|Prepared for me, really? I've dismantled your ridiculous chariot before. Even Poseidon knows you're just a blowhard with a fancy ride.
TheseusPoseidonQuestReaction01|Theseus Poseidon Quest Reaction 01|Theseus|How *dare *you to invoke my Lord Poseidon's name?! And, to besmirch our complicated past! No god shall ever favor you as he has favored both Asterius and me!
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Theseus|Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Minotaur|Two against one. Seems hardly fair.... Ah, well! *<Snort> *Let's kill him and be done, king.
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Zagreus|Theseus?! The Bull of Minos?! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Theseus|*Ahh*, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Minotaur|I warned you, short one. Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only other foe whom I have ever faced, who bested me.

TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouLost|Theseus Second Encounter 01 If You Lost|Theseus|So! The fiend returns to challenge us again, Asterius! Despite having experienced such a thorough thrashing by us last time!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouLost|Theseus Second Encounter 01 If You Lost|Zagreus|You know full well that wasn't a fair fight. Face me yourself and we'll see how you fare.
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouLost|Theseus Second Encounter 01 If You Lost|Theseus|*Silence*, you monster! I'll hear no more such wicked lies, half-truths, or quarter-truths! You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouWon|Theseus Second Encounter 01 If You Won|Theseus|So! The fiend returns to challenge us again, Asterius! Or, rather, to besmirch the honor of this competition!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouWon|Theseus Second Encounter 01 If You Won|Zagreus|Besmirch *what *honor? You're just complaining that you lost. Even though I was outnumbered!

You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Theseus|What are those bestial gloves of yours, blackguard? Beginning to show more of your true and savage nature, here perhaps?
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|No. He bears the Twin Fists in the aspect of a king called Gilgamesh. That king, he, too, wrestled a beastlike man, who then became a friend. Maybe that's why I knew this fight would come.
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Theseus|What are you telling me, Asterius? Now is certainly not a good time for waxing philosophical, I think! And, surely this King Gilgamesh of whom you speak is much more competent a fighter than *this *filth!
TheseusEncounter01|Theseus Encounter 01|Theseus|So, hellspawn! You seek to break through to the surface of the world. But you shall not achieve your goal, whilst I yet live and breathe! Or the equivalent of it, here in the splendors of Elysium!
TheseusEncounter01|Theseus Encounter 01|Zagreus|Then you leave me with little choice but to make you shut up, already. And your bull-headed manservant there.
TheseusEncounter01|Theseus Encounter 01|Theseus|That *Minotaur *whom you address is my dear friend, you preconceiving stain upon the earth! Asterius and I are brothers here in death as we were enemies in life. Not that you could ever understand fraternal bonds as strong as ours!
TheseusEncounter02|Theseus Encounter 02|Theseus|*Ah-hah*, the fiend comes crawling back once more, drawn as he is much like the unassuming moth unto the flame of righteousness!
TheseusEncounter02|Theseus Encounter 02|Zagreus|Oh no! Not the flame of righteousness! Are you finished? Let's get this started, I've come a long way.
TheseusEncounter02|Theseus Encounter 02|Theseus|Hear that, Asterius? Our fiendish visitor is begging us for mercy. Begging us, no doubt, to drop our guard!! Together now, my friend, let's vanquish him, and may the glory of Olympus guide us!!
TheseusEncounter03|Theseus Encounter 03|Theseus|And where do you think you're going, fiend?! Thought you might scoot right past Asterius and myself without a fight?
TheseusEncounter03|Theseus Encounter 03|Zagreus|No, on quite the contrary I've been under no impression that avoiding conflict is an option here. So say your piece, and let's get on with it.
TheseusEncounter03|Theseus Encounter 03|Theseus|You, hellspawn, shall not traverse that gate behind me whilst my compatriot and I equivalently live and breathe! Prepare for death!
TheseusEncounter04|Theseus Encounter 04|Theseus|*Ah, hahaha, *you are just in time, Fiend from Lowest Depths! Asterius and I have trained extensively since our last skirmish here!
TheseusEncounter04|Theseus Encounter 04|Zagreus|So all you do here in Elysium is train for martial competition? You're constantly awaiting your next fight to the death?
TheseusEncounter04|Theseus Encounter 04|Theseus|And who are *you *to judge, you misbegotten, shameful, unfilial maggot? It is an *honor *to have the opportunity to spend my afterlife perpetually standing in your ruinous path!
TheseusEncounter05|Theseus Encounter 05|Theseus|See here, Asterius! The god-hated fiend is back once more to be destroyed by our joint, righteous fury!
TheseusEncounter05|Theseus Encounter 05|Zagreus|*God-hated*? You'll have to be more specific. I have the gods on my side. Though I suppose you do, too. Why can't they make up their minds?
TheseusEncounter05|Theseus Encounter 05|Theseus|They *have *made up their minds! They stand united against darkness, as do I! With the exception of Asterius, here, who serves the light! Let's serve it now, my friend! To battle!
TheseusWinStreak01|Theseus Win Streak 01|Theseus|Upon my word, the fiend again darkens these halls! Alas, Asterius, it seems I was mistaken and he hasn't learned his lesson after all!
TheseusWinStreak01|Theseus Win Streak 01|Zagreus|And what's this lesson that I ought have learned? Is it to always slay you first since you're so damn insufferable all the time?
TheseusWinStreak01|Theseus Win Streak 01|Theseus|Your lesson, monster, is to never, *ever *take up arms against those favored by the gods themselves! You shall never see the light of day as I once did! Uh, no offense, Asterius.
TheseusLoseStreak01|Theseus Lose Streak 01|Theseus|Well, hellspawn, you stained my honor last we battled here. But as you plainly see, I have returned! As has Asterius! And we've no shortage of honor left to spare!
TheseusLoseStreak01|Theseus Lose Streak 01|Zagreus|Shouldn't *I * be the Champion of Elysium, now that I've beaten you? Isn't there someone else around to challenge me, say, Heracles? Someone less chatty?
TheseusLoseStreak01|Theseus Lose Streak 01|Theseus|*Ah, hahaha, *very clever, fiend. Invoking Heracles' name, in an attempt to drive me to a jealous rage. It shall not work! But you shall dearly pay nevertheless!
TheseusLoseStreak02A|Theseus Lose Streak 02 A|Theseus|The monster has returned, in a vainglorious attempt to wrest the title Champion from me!
TheseusLoseStreak02A|Theseus Lose Streak 02 A|Zagreus|I couldn't care less about your title. Though, shouldn't you share it with the Minotaur? He's more than half the reason you've been any trouble.
TheseusLoseStreak02A|Theseus Lose Streak 02 A|Theseus|You'll not drive a wedge between us, fiend. Asterius and I share a fraternal bond forged from the strongest bronze! Nay, adamant! But you have caused us both offense, so, die!
TheseusLoseStreak02|Theseus Lose Streak 02|Theseus|I have recovered, as you can plainly see, monster! As has Asterius! And this time we are filled with renewed vigor, to destroy you utterly!
TheseusLoseStreak02|Theseus Lose Streak 02|Zagreus|So we're locked in an endless cycle of violence, basically. I guess that's one way for you to pass the time here in this stodgy place.
TheseusLoseStreak02|Theseus Lose Streak 02|Theseus|You take that back about Elysium! Or, better: I shall make you eat those careless, inappropriate remarks! Come, Asterius, *to war*!
TheseusWithAsterius02|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (2)|Minotaur|We're well-equipped to deal with you, short one. Though I know better than to disregard your might.
TheseusWithAsterius02|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (2)|Theseus|Speak for yourself, Asterius! I, for one, know only pure contempt for this foul daemon and his underhanded fighting style! A style we shall easily dismantle, now!
TheseusWithAsterius03|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (3)|Theseus|What hope have you, monster, versus the blessed bonds of brotherhood?
TheseusWithAsterius03|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (3)|Minotaur|Best not belittle him, king. He is more powerful than he appears. We must remain alert, this time.
TheseusWithAsterius03|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (3)|Theseus|Oh, I am perfectly alert right now, Asterius! And were I still alive, I would be positively salivating at the thought of running through this pustule with my spear, or whichever means I had available! Now, *let's go*!
TheseusWithAsterius04|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (4)|Zagreus|Theseus, before you flap your ghostly gums at me again, I'd like to hear from good Asterius this time! He almost never gets a word in, thanks to you.
TheseusWithAsterius04|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (4)|Minotaur|The king speaks for the both of us, short one. Though if you wish to hear me say something to you, I will oblige.
TheseusWithAsterius04|Duo - Theseus and Asterius (4)|Theseus|And I, too, shall oblige! That is, oblige my trusty spear, which yearns to penetrate your soft and vulnerable, altogether pallid flesh! Now, die!
TheseusPostEnding01|Theseus Post Ending 01|Theseus|Why, look, Asterius, the fiend returns! The rumors that he fled to haunt the surface must have been mere lies!
TheseusPostEnding01|Theseus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Well no, in this case, those rumors must have been quite accurate, it's just, I'm back! Realized I didn't want a future for myself that didn't include crushing you repeatedly like this.
TheseusPostEnding01|Theseus Post Ending 01|Theseus|Oh, *hoho*, such *clever *excuse-making from one so versed in treachery! Well, if you are indeed contained within this realm, then we shall be delighted to make sure it always stays that way! Now come and fight!
TheseusPostEpilogue01|Theseus Post Epilogue 01|Theseus|Have you yet heard, monster?! The Queen Persephone is back! To rule the Underworld in all her terrifying grace! Perhaps one of these days or nights she shall be present in the stands, to witness your destruction at our hands!
TheseusPostEpilogue01|Theseus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Yeah, about that? She's my mother. So maybe watch your fool mouth with me, or else I might just put in a bad word!
TheseusPostEpilogue01|Theseus Post Epilogue 01|Theseus|Oh, you disgust me, daemon, that you would even dare to say such things about the Queen! Prepare now to be *vanquished *in her name!
TheseusLowHealth01|Theseus Low Health 01|Theseus|What's this, Asterius? This blackguard thinks that he can saunter in here whilst bleeding profusely, and confront the two of us?! A hollow fool!
TheseusLowHealth01|Theseus Low Health 01|Zagreus|Ran into trouble on the way with your combative friends here in Elysium. One more unfair advantage in your favor.
TheseusLowHealth01|Theseus Low Health 01|Theseus|How would you know of fairness, fiend? You belong in the lowest depths, forgotten in the mists of time! Come, let us send you there!
TheseusLowHealth02|Theseus Low Health 02|Theseus|Look at this contemptible fiend, stumbling half-dead already into our hallowed colosseum! What transpired, monster, did perchance my Exalted brethren trouble your dark path?
TheseusLowHealth02|Theseus Low Health 02|Zagreus|Theseus? I would appreciate it if you could be more considerate of the substantial effort necessary just to reach this point where I can make you shut your mouth.
TheseusLowHealth02|Theseus Low Health 02|Theseus|Effort, *pah*! You shall be imminently slain, and *effortlessly*, I am quite certain of that! Asterius, to arms!!
TheseusLowHealth03|Theseus Low Health 03|Theseus|What hope can you possibly have of vanquishing us, hellspawn, when you are visibly upon the verge of death? You are, more than usual, a miserable sight!
TheseusLowHealth03|Theseus Low Health 03|Zagreus|Thanks for your concern, there, Theseus. But I trust I have plenty of life left in me with which to destroy you, if not your companion as well.
TheseusLowHealth03|Theseus Low Health 03|Theseus|*Hah! *What would you know of trust! Being a vile, grievously-wounded-already creature such as you are! Asterius, let's end his misery!
TheseusYarnReaction01|Theseus Yarn Reaction 01|Theseus|What's this? Our enemy has come to mock us, Asterius! He holds the Yarn of Ariadne, and would flaunt it in our faces!
TheseusYarnReaction01|Theseus Yarn Reaction 01|Zagreus|What, this? I just picked it out of a Well. Was supposed to help me get here. No offense intended, more than usual. What's it to you?
TheseusYarnReaction01|Theseus Yarn Reaction 01|Theseus|As if you wouldn't know! That Yarn is a token of days long gone. When Asterius and I battled in the Labyrinth, to the death! Together, we now face a greater threat. Attack us if you dare!
TheseusYarnReaction02|Theseus Yarn Reaction 02|Theseus|Again you mock me with the Yarn of Ariadne, blackguard. You ought know that woman's name means absolutely nothing to me, now!
TheseusYarnReaction02|Theseus Yarn Reaction 02|Zagreus|You seem pretty put off by a random bit of twine, there, Former King of Athens. Care to share your innermost thoughts on the subject, or best keep them bottled up?
TheseusYarnReaction02|Theseus Yarn Reaction 02|Theseus|Nothing shall be bottled *here*, you filth! That she became enamored of me was not my responsibility, besides! She was naive! The same as you.
TheseusYarnReaction03|Theseus Yarn Reaction 03|Theseus|That blasted Yarn of Ariadne, once again!! Have you no shred of dignity at all, monster? Or would you stoop to any desperate means to draw me out?
TheseusYarnReaction03|Theseus Yarn Reaction 03|Zagreus|Just happened to have it on me, Theseus. But it seems to keep upsetting you. Maybe you should seek this Ariadne in my father's realm, and make amends?
TheseusYarnReaction03|Theseus Yarn Reaction 03|Theseus|Maybe *you *should *shut up*!! That Ariadne's dead to me. She has been since we were alive! I cherish her memory, yes. But only because, if not for her, I'd not have met Asterius! Now, meet his axe!!
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Theseus|Why, look, Asterius! It seems the fiend has brought some sort of nondescript yarn-ball! Not seen the likes of it. Indeed, it holds no sway on me, at all!
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Minotaur|King. The princess Ariadne was my sister, if you don't recall. Please do not denigrate her memory. *<Snort> *You're making me upset.
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Theseus|*Ah*, no, my friend! I meant you no offense! But I'd no love for her, was that my fault?! *Pff*, forgive me. I... I shall seek her out. Someday or night. But first!! This daemon *has *to be destroyed. Together, no?!
TheseusAutographReaction01|Theseus Autograph Reaction 01|Theseus|Now hold a moment, fiend! Asterius made me aware that you recently asked of him an *autograph*. A tribute to his fame! As I am Champion, I am prepared to generously offer mine, as well.
TheseusAutographReaction01|Theseus Autograph Reaction 01|Zagreus|Oh! No thanks. Appreciate the offer, though. How about a fight, instead?
TheseusAutographReaction01|Theseus Autograph Reaction 01|Theseus|*Ah, pffsch*, you...! 'Twas merely a jest! I'd not have given you the cloth about my loins, much less my name! But a fight you certainly shall have!
TheseusAboutBeingChampion01|Theseus About Being Champion 01|Theseus|Ready yourself, Asterius, my friend! For our most hated enemy has come to challenge us again, before this loving crowd!
TheseusAboutBeingChampion01|Theseus About Being Champion 01|Zagreus|I don't understand this place at all. How is it you're still champion after all this time? After losing repeatedly and often, I mean.
TheseusAboutBeingChampion01|Theseus About Being Champion 01|Theseus|What would you know of it?! There's more, much more, to being champion than empty victories! It is a way of thought. A bearing! A certain dignity which you shall never have!
TheseusAboutGods01|Theseus About Gods 01|Theseus|The gods are testing us once more, Asterius! For, how else to explain this fiend approaching us, bearing such blessings as would normally be fit only for heroes such as we?
TheseusAboutGods01|Theseus About Gods 01|Zagreus|You *do *know I'm related to them, right? The god of the dead is my father? I'm sure word's gotten around. Not that I want deferential treatment from the likes of you.
TheseusAboutGods01|Theseus About Gods 01|Theseus|Good! For you'll get nothing of the sort. The gods are on *my *side, not yours, monster! What business would they have, abetting you?
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds01|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 01|Theseus|Beware, Asterius! The daemon comes! The daemon, who would sever the fraternal bonds we share, if we so much as drop our guard!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds01|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 01|Zagreus|What? You think I'm here to ruin your friendship? Look, to each his own in that regard, though since you bring it up, I really don't see why Asterius puts up with you.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds01|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 01|Theseus|*You see*? Just as I said! Cover your bovine ears, Asterius, for this monstrosity would poison us to get the upper hand!
TheseusAboutManyBattles01|Theseus About Many Battles 01|Theseus|You know, hellspawn, I have been thinking on this for some time, and I've a declaration I must make: I shall hear no more of your silver-tongued lies. You come here, and we fight, and that is all!
TheseusAboutManyBattles01|Theseus About Many Battles 01|Zagreus|What are you even talking about? I barely get a word in edgewise, much less Asterius over there. You know what? Fine. I've had it with you, anyway.
TheseusAboutManyBattles01|Theseus About Many Battles 01|Theseus|And *I*'ve had it with *you*! Now, come, Asterius, let's shut this blackguard up! Or shut him *down*, whichever you prefer.
TheseusAboutManyBattles02|Theseus About Many Battles 02|Theseus|There is but one thing I shall give to you, blackguard. Other than the razor-sharp point of my blessed spear! You are resilient. Time after time, you challenge us! Sometimes I fear I shall develop some sort of grudging respect for you!
TheseusAboutManyBattles02|Theseus About Many Battles 02|Zagreus|I've no such fear, myself, Theseus. Though, I appreciate you noticing. You're quite an inspiration, you know? I wouldn't come all this way to destroy just anyone.
TheseusAboutManyBattles02|Theseus About Many Battles 02|Theseus|To *be *destroyed, you mean! I see you plain, monster. You seek the glory of this fight, before this crowd? You yearn for it! Then, you shall have it! Just as often as you please!
TheseusAboutPainting01|Theseus About Painting 01|Theseus|I vividly recall our every clash against you, daemon. Each victory! And even the defeats. But you? You've not learned anything, have you?
TheseusAboutPainting01|Theseus About Painting 01|Zagreus|It's all right, Theseus. We have a splendid painting of you back at the House, for those moments when I invariably forget you exist. You were quite dashing with long hair, you know!
TheseusAboutPainting01|Theseus About Painting 01|Theseus|So, I am honored even in the lowest pits of hell? And yet, remembered in my carefree youth. Not in the wisdom of my latter days! Well then, remember *this*!
TheseusHasWeaponUpgrade01|Theseus Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Theseus|What, *ho*, that is a handsome spear you doubtless claimed deceitfully from some more-worthy bearer than yourself!
TheseusHasWeaponUpgrade01|Theseus Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Zagreus|Oh, this old thing? How nice of you to notice. It once belonged to the hero, Achilles. A little past your time, but maybe you've heard of him? Seeing as he's *much *more famous than you ever were.
TheseusHasWeaponUpgrade01|Theseus Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Theseus|How *dare *you say such things to me! I was the greatest king of Athens in my day! The tales of my exploits with Asterius and many other challenges shall long outlive whatever comes of *you*!
TheseusAboutArthurAspect01|Theseus About Arthur Aspect 01|Theseus|Tell me something, monster: Whence did you steal that kingly blade you're brandishing about? It seems ill-fitting for one such as you.
TheseusAboutArthurAspect01|Theseus About Arthur Aspect 01|Zagreus|Oh, this? I wouldn't say I stole it, so much as naturally wooed the Fates into bestowing it upon me. You could say I'm kind of testing it out.
TheseusAboutArthurAspect01|Theseus About Arthur Aspect 01|Theseus|*Ahh*, well then! I pity whosoever shall lay hands upon that cursed thing, once you are finished with this *testing *of yours. I think that we can make it rather quick!
TheseusMiscStartWithGilgameshAspect01|Duo - Start and Gilgamesh Aspect (1)|Minotaur|There, king! He has the weapons I told you about... the fists of Gilgamesh. Follow my lead this time.

TheseusMiscStart13|Theseus Misc Start 13|Theseus|We've nothing left to say to one another, hellspawn! Other than: To battle!
TheseusMiscStart14|Theseus Misc Start 14|Theseus|Few others in Elysium are so unwise to take up arms against Asterius and myself!
TheseusMiscStart15|Theseus Misc Start 15|Theseus|You challenge us to battle, hellspawn?! Then, Asterius and I accept!
TheseusMiscStart16|Theseus Misc Start 16|Theseus|Attack us if you dare, blackguard! Asterius and I stand ready!

TheseusMiscStart22|Theseus Misc Start 22|Theseus|Upon my faith, you'll take not one more step toward the light of day!

MinotaurExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Extreme Measures 01|Minotaur|Observe this gleaming coat of bronze with which I am adorned, now, short one. *<Snort> *Your doing, as I'm to understand.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|My father is to thank for that, not me. I've proven difficult for him to contain, so now I'm beneficiary of his latest Pact of Punishment. You're welcome!
MinotaurExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Extreme Measures 01|Minotaur|I hadn't thanked you, as of yet. Though, come. I'll repay you suitably for having me encased within this... suit.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Extreme Measures 02|Minotaur|Tell me, short one, where is your own armored suit? I would prefer not to do battle against one who's ill equipped.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Extreme Measures 02|Zagreus|You know, my father keeps the dress code very strict down there in Tartarus. No armor in the House! Never tried the stuff.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Extreme Measures 02|Minotaur|Dress code. *<Snort> *I, too, follow a code. And it's a code that strictly states I cannot let you pass without a fight.
MinotaurExtremeMeasuresWinStreak01|Minotaur Extreme Measures Win Streak 01|Minotaur|Even with this armor I was unable to best you one-to-one. Perhaps I lack as yet the necessary training to take full advantage of its benefit.
MinotaurExtremeMeasuresWinStreak01|Minotaur Extreme Measures Win Streak 01|Zagreus|I don't suppose you have some good acquaintances with whom to train, until such time as you see fit to face me once again?
MinotaurExtremeMeasuresWinStreak01|Minotaur Extreme Measures Win Streak 01|Minotaur|No. *<Snort> *King Theseus is occupied with preparations of his own. You are my good acquaintance now.
MinotaurPactReverted01|Minotaur Pact Reverted 01|Minotaur|I am returned once more to my more-earthly capability, short one. And I am able to move freely once again.
MinotaurPactReverted01|Minotaur Pact Reverted 01|Zagreus|Fine change of pace, Asterius! Who needs that old, spectacular, custom-fitting suit of legendary armor, anyway?
MinotaurPactReverted01|Minotaur Pact Reverted 01|Minotaur|You mock me. Yet you know nothing of being trapped; enclosed in something and unable to break free. I need no armor to fight you.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|You haven't spoken to your fist-weapons yet, have you, short one? *'I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death.' *That's what you're supposed to tell them. I'm sure of it.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|Just been a little tied up lately is all, but I will get to it, Asterius! I guess you'll want to know the result?
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|Yes. Here, I'll give you this chance to get home quickly, if you want to know, yourself.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect02|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 02|Minotaur|There, on your hands... the weapons you call Malphon. They're just as I saw in my dream. Monstrous. Like me.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect02|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 02|Zagreus|Former property of someone called Gilgamesh. The beast-man he fought, Enkidu... you said they became friends? What said your dream about us on that front, sir?
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect02|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 02|Minotaur|It didn't say much. Only that we would fight. Just as that Gilgamesh and Enkidu once did. Maybe the outcome will be the same, maybe it won't. We'll find out.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Minotaur|You come from the bowels of hell. This is not your place.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Zagreus|Agreed on both counts! Just passing through, so if you'll excuse me...
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Minotaur|I will not. *<Snort> *The Champion of Elysium would never back down from such a contest. Neither will I.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Zagreus|Wait, *you're *not the Champion of Elysium...? You're the Bull of Minos! I can't imagine who's even stronger than you. Is it Heracles? Tell me it's Heracles.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Minotaur|I will not. *<Snort> *You talk too much, short one. Come get destroyed.
MinotaurMetTheseus01|Minotaur Met Theseus 01|Minotaur|You have met the Champion, the king. Let us see if you are fit to face him once again.
MinotaurMetTheseus01|Minotaur Met Theseus 01|Zagreus|You mean face both of you, together. Which doesn't seem particularly fair.
MinotaurMetTheseus01|Minotaur Met Theseus 01|Minotaur|Life isn't particularly fair, short one. Nor death. I'd have expected you to know as much. But here, have your fair fight.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Minotaur|Let us clash here again before you face the Champion. We never will allow you through without a fight.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Zagreus|You're nothing like Theseus. Why go along with everything he says and does? You're your own man. And bull.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Minotaur|King Theseus slew me in life, and saved me in death. I was cast into Erebus. A monster. He found me when he died. And used his influence to bring me here, with him.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Zagreus|That's nice of him and all, but sounds like you're even to me. Seeing as he killed you in the first place.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Minotaur|No; we're not. And I will fight for him, and alongside him, for eternity. As recompense for helping me to understand exactly who I am.
MinotaurDefeatedTheseus01|Minotaur Defeated Theseus 01|Minotaur|You bested the Champion, himself. Which means that I have little hope of vanquishing you, here.
MinotaurDefeatedTheseus01|Minotaur Defeated Theseus 01|Zagreus|So then, why bother fighting me? You don't have to do this. That Theseus is a highly questionable influence on you!
MinotaurDefeatedTheseus01|Minotaur Defeated Theseus 01|Minotaur|I see you plain, short one. I, too, was born of darkness. But, I chose the path of light. Even in death, it was not too late. *<Snort> *Not even for a monster, such as I. I trust your deaths will likewise be enlightening.
MinotaurPactHighHeatReaction01|Minotaur Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Minotaur|This heat... it reminds me of when I was young. Living in darkness. Learning to fight. To kill.
MinotaurPactHighHeatReaction01|Minotaur Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Zagreus|I suppose you're about to put that learning to practice in another moment here?
MinotaurPactHighHeatReaction01|Minotaur Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Minotaur|I am. The heat fills me with strength. Let's see if it has any effect on you.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|*Ah*. I sense another furious battle here awaits us, short one. Although you're more inquisitive than usual...
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Zagreus|*Uhh*, oh! It's just, I have an odd request. You see, the god of slumber, Hypnos? Colleague of mine. Huge fan. He's in desperate need of your autograph. Little personalized message? I don't suppose you'd be so kind. It'd mean a lot to him.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|Autograph. I see. Then, it appears there are such gods as favor me. I will inscribe a bit of parchment for your colleague, then.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Storyteller|*The god-forsaken Minotaur impresses then upon a parchment a brief message to the god of sleep, and gives it to the favor-asking Prince.*
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|Know, short one, that this favor is for you and not for Hypnos. Though he may challenge me himself, at any time.
MinotaurAboutFistWeapon01|Minotaur About Fist Weapon 01|Minotaur|*Huh*. You mean to fight with me bare-handed this time, short one? I'm not ashamed to say the Champion himself defeated me in such a manner back when we drew breath.
MinotaurAboutFistWeapon01|Minotaur About Fist Weapon 01|Zagreus|Wouldn't say the Twin Fists of Malphon counts as empty-handed, sir, though it surprises me to hear you could be beaten in such a way.
MinotaurAboutFistWeapon01|Minotaur About Fist Weapon 01|Minotaur|I was hungry and unprepared. Inexperienced. No longer. Come.
MinotaurAboutFriendship01|Minotaur About Friendship 01|Minotaur|You must take pleasure in having to fight against me, short one. I, too, have come to look forward to it. Even if I end up falling to your strength.
MinotaurAboutFriendship01|Minotaur About Friendship 01|Zagreus|Oh, I was going to say, I'd much prefer we settle this more amicably, couldn't we? Perhaps I could interest you in a fine bottle of Nectar? Ambrosia, even?
MinotaurAboutFriendship01|Minotaur About Friendship 01|Minotaur|No, thank you. These battles are enough. Besides... you won that Ambrosia from us, fair and square.
MinotaurAboutFriendship02|Minotaur About Friendship 02|Minotaur|Well, you're back, short one. Or Prince. Whatever they call you. I'm not much for formality.
MinotaurAboutFriendship02|Minotaur About Friendship 02|Zagreus|Not much for it either, here, Asterius. Though, speaking of which, how would you prefer to be addressed? The Minotaur, the Bull of Minos? Those aren't offensive to you, are they?
MinotaurAboutFriendship02|Minotaur About Friendship 02|Minotaur|They don't mean anything to me. They mean something to others. I have my name. You know it. Use it if you want. Now, enough.
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Zagreus|Say, you're from Crete, originally, aren't you, Asterius? I know this is a stretch, but... I don't suppose you ever heard of a commander by the name of *Schelemeus*? Captain of the Cretan second fleet, something like that?
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Minotaur|The king of Crete commanded the greatest navy in the world. Even I knew that, having never seen the light of day, the ships, the sea. *Schelemeus*, huh...? I might have heard the name. So what?
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Zagreus|What, Schelemeus was a real person, then? But, Skelly said... ah, you know what, it's nothing, Asterius. Shall we?
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Minotaur|Yes. Let's.
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|You've come, short one. I dreamed of this very moment.
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|Come on, Asterius, we've fought how many times already? What's there to dream about?
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|No. I dreamed. And in my dream, there was something I had to tell you. Rather... something you have to tell the weapons you wear on your hands. Tell them, *'I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death.'*
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|Hey, I know what that is, that's a waking-phrase. So I'm to speak it to Malphon. Wait, why are you helping me?
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|I don't know whether I'm helping you or not. But in my dream... an ancient hero fought a beast of a man, barehanded. They became friends, in the end, after a great battle. I long for a fight like that.
MinotaurClearProgress01|Minotaur Clear Progress 01|Minotaur|I wonder something, short one. You keep coming back. But I don't know why. You're trying to get out of here, aren't you? But something's killing you up there.
MinotaurClearProgress01|Minotaur Clear Progress 01|Zagreus|You've deduced more or less correctly, Asterius. And yes, let's say there are some challenges remaining once I get out of Elysium. Though I'd best say no more of it than that.
MinotaurClearProgress01|Minotaur Clear Progress 01|Minotaur|That's fine. It's good to know you've fallen just as often as I have. I may not be the one to kill you. But I'll soften you up for whoever does.
MinotaurClearProgress01_B|Minotaur Clear Progress 01 B|Minotaur|You ever make it out of here, short one? I wonder, sometimes, what it must be like... the outside.
MinotaurClearProgress01_B|Minotaur Clear Progress 01 B|Zagreus|You've never been outside? Oh, right... the labyrinth thing. You lived in a horrible maze all your life. I haven't seen much of the surface, but... it's beautiful. Cold. When I'm there, though, I... feel out of place.
MinotaurClearProgress01_B|Minotaur Clear Progress 01 B|Minotaur|Out of place. I understand, I think. I don't see why you'd want to go somewhere like that. It can't live up to the stories. Why ruin it? Speaking of which...
MinotaurPostEpilogue01|Minotaur Post Epilogue 01|Minotaur|Everyone's saying that the Queen is back. Do you know what that means, short one?
MinotaurPostEpilogue01|Minotaur Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Well, for me, at least, it happens to mean quite a bit. I'm her son!
MinotaurPostEpilogue01|Minotaur Post Epilogue 01|Minotaur|It doesn't mean a thing. We're still here to fight. Though, for what it's worth... my mother also was a queen. May yours treat you better than she treated me. Better than I'm about to treat you, here.
MinotaurLowHealth01|Minotaur Low Health 01|Minotaur|I smell the blood on you, short one. *<Snort> *You are severely wounded. This will not be a fair fight.
MinotaurLowHealth01|Minotaur Low Health 01|Zagreus|An unfair fight is not worth having, then, wouldn't you say?
MinotaurLowHealth01|Minotaur Low Health 01|Minotaur|I would not. An unfair fight is better than no fight at all.
MinotaurLowHealth02|Minotaur Low Health 02|Minotaur|You're hardly in a state to fight against me, here. Won't take too long to bring you death.
MinotaurLowHealth02|Minotaur Low Health 02|Zagreus|Great! Thanks for the encouragement, Asterius. Don't let me keep you waiting on that, then.
MinotaurLowHealth02|Minotaur Low Health 02|Minotaur|If mere words can sap your will for battle, short one, then know this: You never stood a chance.
MinotaurLowHealth03|Minotaur Low Health 03|Minotaur|You look as though you withstood many foes in getting here this time. Barely withstood, that is.
MinotaurLowHealth03|Minotaur Low Health 03|Zagreus|They took a lot out of me, yes. But you have no idea just how long and arduous a trip it is from Tartarus to here!
MinotaurLowHealth03|Minotaur Low Health 03|Minotaur|What would you know of arduous? Try living in an ever-shifting maze of countless passageways. Now let me finish what your foes began.
MinotaurEncounter01|Minotaur Encounter 01|Minotaur|We meet again, short one. For further battle.
MinotaurEncounter01|Minotaur Encounter 01|Zagreus|*Short one*?! That's a low blow, sir. I thought you were the big-honorable type.
MinotaurEncounter01|Minotaur Encounter 01|Minotaur|You mock my sense of honor. *<Snort> *Common tactic. Now prepare.
MinotaurEncounter02|Minotaur Encounter 02|Minotaur|You choose to challenge me again. Not many in Elysium so dare. Then, I accept.
MinotaurEncounter02|Minotaur Encounter 02|Zagreus|Wait, I never challenged you! The entrance to your chamber looks like any other pathway in Elysium. I have no quarrel with you, sir!
MinotaurEncounter02|Minotaur Encounter 02|Minotaur|To step into my chamber is to challenge me. *<Snort> *It is a custom since the time I lived and breathed in darkness. I will send you into such a darkness now.
MinotaurEncounter03|Minotaur Encounter 03|Minotaur|My next opponent has arrived in short order.
MinotaurEncounter03|Minotaur Encounter 03|Zagreus|Short order? That was another jab about my height, wasn't it!
MinotaurEncounter03|Minotaur Encounter 03|Minotaur|I do not jab. *<Snort> *All of my strength goes into every strike. Observe.
MinotaurEncounter04|Minotaur Encounter 04|Minotaur|You have returned to my chamber. I trust you are familiar now with what this means.
MinotaurEncounter04|Minotaur Encounter 04|Zagreus|It means I've challenged you to a battle of strength and glory, because apparently that's all there is to do for fun around here for those such as yourself?
MinotaurEncounter04|Minotaur Encounter 04|Minotaur|That... *<Snort> *Yes. Essentially that is correct. Prepare.
MinotaurEncounter05|Minotaur Encounter 05|Minotaur|It would seem *<Snort> *that the time for additional *fun *has arrived.
MinotaurEncounter05|Minotaur Encounter 05|Zagreus|Ah, yes, my favorite pastime: Getting butchered by a giant double-bladed axe. And sometimes trampled.
MinotaurEncounter05|Minotaur Encounter 05|Minotaur|Then, good. You have much to enjoy in store.
MinotaurEncounter06|Minotaur Encounter 06|Minotaur|Well, short one. It seems I must attempt to maim you here, so that the king and I might finally stop you at the gates.
MinotaurEncounter06|Minotaur Encounter 06|Zagreus|You know, you hurt me with this '*short one*' business almost as much as with that axe. Why isn't Theseus '*short one*'? We're the same height!
MinotaurEncounter06|Minotaur Encounter 06|Minotaur|No. The king is greater. He is the greatest king of Athens! What are you? A willful son of a fickle god. I am beneath your father's notice. And you are beneath the king's. Now fight me.
MinotaurWinStreak01|Minotaur Win Streak 01|Minotaur|It is not often that my challengers return to face another slaughter at my hands.
MinotaurWinStreak01|Minotaur Win Streak 01|Zagreus|Yeah, well. You're kind of in my way. What choice do I have?
MinotaurWinStreak01|Minotaur Win Streak 01|Minotaur|Your choices led you here, and they will lead you to defeat, again.
MinotaurLoseStreak01|Minotaur Lose Streak 01|Minotaur|You are more skilled than I expected, short one. A re-match is most certainly in order.
MinotaurLoseStreak01|Minotaur Lose Streak 01|Zagreus|You're going to force a rematch each time I manage to defeat you, aren't you?
MinotaurLoseStreak01|Minotaur Lose Streak 01|Minotaur|We and our victories are all impermanent here in Elysium. We live, such as it is, for moments such as these.
MinotaurMiscStart01|Minotaur Misc Start 01|Minotaur|Your challenge is hereby accepted, short one.
MinotaurMiscStart02|Minotaur Misc Start 02|Minotaur|Another challenger. *<Snort> *Come get destroyed.
MinotaurMiscStart03|Minotaur Misc Start 03|Minotaur|I accept all challengers. No prior notice necessary.
MinotaurMiscStart04|Minotaur Misc Start 04|Minotaur|You have returned. *<Snort> *I'm always ready to oppose you.
MinotaurMiscStart05|Minotaur Misc Start 05|Minotaur|You enter my chamber once again, short one. Then, good.
MinotaurMiscStart06|Minotaur Misc Start 06|Minotaur|I expected you to reappear. *<Snort> *Let us fight.
MinotaurMiscStart07|Minotaur Misc Start 07|Minotaur|Appears it's time we challenged one another once again. Prepare.
MinotaurMiscStart08|Minotaur Misc Start 08|Minotaur|Good. *<Snort> *It feels as though I haven't crushed the life from anything in ages.
MinotaurMiscStart09|Minotaur Misc Start 09|Minotaur|Returned to battle me for glory, short one? *<Snort> *Excellent.
MinotaurMiscStart10|Minotaur Misc Start 10|Minotaur|Come fight me again, short one. We have eternity to grow stronger.
MinotaurMiscStart11|Minotaur Misc Start 11|Minotaur|Thank you, short one. *<Snort> *Few in Elysium dare challenge me repeatedly.
MinotaurMiscStart12|Minotaur Misc Start 12|Minotaur|The short one from the bowels of hell has finally returned.
MinotaurMiscStart13|Minotaur Misc Start 13|Minotaur|I heard you had again entered Elysium. *<Snort> *At last.
MinotaurMiscStart14|Minotaur Misc Start 14|Minotaur|Hold nothing back against me, short one. Now, come.
MinotaurMiscStart15|Minotaur Misc Start 15|Minotaur|Let us grow stronger in the ways of battle, short one.
MinotaurMiscStart16|Minotaur Misc Start 16|Minotaur|I always am prepared to fight whoever dares oppose me.
MinotaurMiscStart17|Minotaur Misc Start 17|Minotaur|Let us battle now before you face the Champion, himself.
MinotaurMiscStart19|Minotaur Misc Start 19|Minotaur|You seek the Champion. You must confront me, first.
MinotaurMiscStart20|Minotaur Misc Start 20|Minotaur|Hrmm. *<Snort> *It has been long enough since my last fight.
MinotaurMiscStart21|Minotaur Misc Start 21|Minotaur|I've been waiting for another round against you. Let's go. Now.
MinotaurMiscStart22|Minotaur Misc Start 22|Minotaur|They said you were headed this way. *<Snort> *I said I'd stop you. Though, we'll see.
MinotaurMiscStart23|Minotaur Misc Start 23|Minotaur|Each time we fight... I think I learn a little more. Let's start.
MinotaurMiscStart24|Minotaur Misc Start 24|Minotaur|I had a feeling you would cross my path again. I've been looking forward to this.
MinotaurMiscStart25|Minotaur Misc Start 25|Minotaur|I'm going to run you down, or run you through. Your choice, short one.
MinotaurMiscStart26|Minotaur Misc Start 26|Minotaur|Told the king I'd try to stop you on the way. He thought I'd have no trouble. *<Snort> *We'll see.
MinotaurMiscStart27|Minotaur Misc Start 27|Minotaur|Come on, short one. I've been waiting too long for this.
MinotaurMiscStart28|Minotaur Misc Start 28|Minotaur|You know what it takes to leave this chamber alive, short one. *<Snort> *Come on and fight.
MinotaurMiscStartExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Misc Start Extreme Measures 01|Minotaur|I have my armor, short one. Let's see what you have.
MinotaurMiscStartExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Misc Start Extreme Measures 02|Minotaur|Let's see if you can cut through my coat this time.
MinotaurMiscStartExtremeMeasures03|Minotaur Misc Start Extreme Measures 03|Minotaur|This armor's heavy. But makes me even faster than before. *<Snort> *Watch.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak01|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 01|Minotaur|You are resilient, short one, I will give you that.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak02|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 02|Minotaur|I'm prepared to slaughter you again, short one. Come fight.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak03|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 03|Minotaur|Interesting. *<Snort> *Most never challenge me again once I destroy them.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak04|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 04|Minotaur|What hope have you against the Champion, if you can't get through me?
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak05|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 05|Minotaur|You have tenacity, short one. I have to give you that.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak06|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 06|Minotaur|You do not take all your defeats to heart, do you? That's good.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak01|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 01|Minotaur|You're quick, short one. Let's see if you can get past me again.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak02|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 02|Minotaur|Well, short one. I'm curious to see if you can best me once again.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak03|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 03|Minotaur|A worthy challenger returns. Let's see you defeat me again.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak04|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 04|Minotaur|Glory and honor to you if you can vanquish me again. Come!
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak05|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 05|Minotaur|I welcome the taste of defeat, short one. It is akin to feeling alive.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak06|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 06|Minotaur|I'm still learning all your tricks, short one. Come show me more.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak07|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 07|Minotaur|Let's see you get through me again, short one.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak08|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 08|Minotaur|I'm the one to challenge *you *this time, short one.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak09|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 09|Minotaur|I have looked forward to repaying you in kind for our last fight.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak10|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 10|Minotaur|You're strong, short one. But I am just as obstinate as you.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak11|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 11|Minotaur|The Champion awaits, short one. If you can get through me again, that is.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak12|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 12|Minotaur|Good. Now I can get you back for last time. All I need is one clean hit.
MinotaurOutro01|Minotaur Outro 01|Minotaur|Well fought. Though, your technique pales in comparison to that of the Champion of Elysium. I expect you'll soon see for yourself.
MinotaurOutro02|Minotaur Outro 02|Minotaur|I respect your strength, short one. The Champion of Elysium awaits. Until such time.
MinotaurOutro03|Minotaur Outro 03|Minotaur|You were a worthy challenger. Most welcome here. Until we meet again.
MinotaurOutro04|Minotaur Outro 04|Minotaur|You have earned your passage. I go now to recover for the next occasion that we meet.
MinotaurOutro05|Minotaur Outro 05|Minotaur|Thank you for sparring with me, short one. I'm glad we've made a habit of it thus.
MinotaurGilgameshAspectOutro01|Minotaur Gilgamesh Aspect Outro 01|Minotaur|*Urgh*... the might of Gilgamesh... I understand it now. But I won't make his friend's mistake. We'll fight again.
MinotaurGilgameshAspectOutro02|Minotaur Gilgamesh Aspect Outro 02|Minotaur|Such strength... the strength of Gilgamesh. Thank you for the battle, short one.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 01|Hades|You now know that, even if you are able to surpass me, you shall ultimately perish, soon enough. And yet you still persist! Utterly senseless.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|I found her, Father. And I'm going to find Mother again. And again, and again, until I have some answers, finally. She'd like some answers, too, beginning with *why did you never tell her that I lived*? You let her go, and left her to her grief!
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 01|Hades|*Silence*, boy! Save all your ignorant and baseless accusations. You seem incapable of heeding my request that you not blather on about a matter you shall never understand. Then, I shall save my breath for this fight!
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 02|Hades|You were never supposed to live. Took all of Nyx's strength to circumvent what should have been a certainty. Now you cannot stay dead. Such is the wry humor of the Fates.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Nyx saved me.... So according to the Fates I was never meant to be born, since neither you nor Mother are of the Underworld, something like that? Or was that just another lie you told, to Mother and whoever else?
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 02|Hades|*Bah! *You think everything a lie. The realm beneath our feet was appointed to me on certain conditions, not that I had much of a choice. Among them: A one-time surface-dweller such as I would never have an heir.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|You really believed that? Then why attempt to have a child, anyway?
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 02|Hades|You don't know anything! Why anyone would *choose *to have a child is a mystery to me. The Fates said I would never have an heir. Perhaps *this *was all they meant.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 05|Hades|To think Olympus has been aiding you. You must be so grateful to them for their aid, without which none of this would have been possible.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 05|Zagreus|Yeah, about that. Father, did... did you let Mother go because you feared Olympus would find out? And... not respond well to the circumstances if they did?
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 05|Hades|*Tsch. *Be grateful they have not found out as yet, for all your meddling. You do not know them as well as you think. Ask yourself why she left Olympus, and how. Or better yet, ask *her*.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 05|Zagreus|Well, she seems quite lovely, so... knowing you, you probably tricked her into signing a pact to come join you, or something. Since you weren't allowed on Olympus, why not have Olympus come to you?
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 05|Hades|*Hah*! Surprisingly not distant from the truth. I took her, boy! I took her down with me. Is that what you wish to hear? Does that anger you? Come, bring forth that anger, then!
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 06|Hades|So, boy. Did you ask her? About how she came to join me in the Underworld. Did you confirm all your suspicions, then?
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 06|Zagreus|You didn't drag her down to hell, yourself, apparently. You're not going to tell me who did, though I can well imagine. Your brothers got to reign forever on Olympus, while you got sent down into the Underworld. So they gave you a consolation prize... didn't they?
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 06|Hades|You make such accusations, knowing next to nothing. Careless as ever. Poseidon had nothing to do with it! He knows even less than you. If you value her existence or your own, you would be wise to keep it that way. And to turn back!
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting07|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 07|Hades|...She was the Queen. Queen of the Underworld! My Queen. Commanding reverence, and awe, and fear. She was not just... what was the term you used? A *consolation prize*? You are as disrespectful to her as you are to me.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting07|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 07|Zagreus|Oh, what would you even know?! You claim so much respect for her, yet you didn't even respect her enough to tell her what happened after she left! But... what am I saying... I know you love her, still, Father. That best explains all the terrible choices you've made.
LordHadesAboutPersephoneMeeting07|Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 07|Hades|...All the terrible choices I've made. By the time you have existed for as long as I have, pray you will have made fewer. Although I fear you shall surpass me in at least this one regard.
LordHadesBeforePersephoneReturn01|Lord Hades Before Persephone Return 01|Hades|...I have done virtually everything within my power to prevent this. All of it... for nothing. The Fates were not content to saddle me within the earth; they mock me, still.
LordHadesBeforePersephoneReturn01|Lord Hades Before Persephone Return 01|Zagreus|Maybe they just think you're in the wrong. And that you're an obstinate, overbearing, miserable excuse for a husband and father. Don't you understand I'm trying to fix the problems you caused? Since you're so unwilling to do it yourself.
LordHadesBeforePersephoneReturn01|Lord Hades Before Persephone Return 01|Hades|You're right. I was unwilling. I made my choices, in all this. I loved her, yes. I loved her terribly. But now... it seems I am merely delaying the inevitable. Go, then. Go to her. But, should harm befall her... I shall bring my worst wrath upon whomever is to blame... including you.
LordHadesBeforePersephoneReturn01|Lord Hades Before Persephone Return 01|Zagreus|What? You're letting me go, just like that? You're just afraid of getting struck down again. You're serious?
LordHadesPostEnding01|Lord Hades Post Ending 01|Hades|*Heh. *Confronting you like this... it's different now. Still... it is a responsibility, just as before. There is to be no escape from my realm. Ultimately, I must see to that, myself.
LordHadesPostEnding01|Lord Hades Post Ending 01|Zagreus|That's the spirit, Father! As for me, I find the candor of our interactions here to be rather refreshing, I must say. Especially the interactions between my weapons and your physique. You're tough, but you're an easy target.
LordHadesPostEnding01|Lord Hades Post Ending 01|Hades|And you are scrawny, though slippery, blast you. All that pent-up rage behind your smiling words... come, unleash it once again. I expect you to go all out. To the death!
LordHadesExtremeMeasures01|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 01|Hades|I was reviewing the terms of the Pact of Punishment to which you are bound. Even when my servants resort to extreme measures, they were still unable to surpass you, then. So now, it is my turn.
LordHadesExtremeMeasures01|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|Caught you unprepared, did I? After Theseus and his Macedonian, I half-expected to see you thundering around on some golden chariot of your own, drawn by sable steeds, that sort of thing. But it's just you.
LordHadesExtremeMeasures01|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 01|Hades|It is just me, indeed. However... that should be more than necessary, here. No holding back this time, Zagreus. Are you ready?
LordHadesHasGuanYuAspect01|Lord Hades Has Guan Yu Aspect 01|Hades|What have you done with my ancient weapon, boy? I sense Varatha's form there in your feeble grip, but... there's some garish power you've awakened in it, haven't you?
LordHadesHasGuanYuAspect01|Lord Hades Has Guan Yu Aspect 01|Zagreus|Oh, just took a splash of Titan Blood at the right time was all. There's more to your ancient weapon than you gave it credit for, I guess. Though let's not keep it waiting, no?
LordHadesHasGuanYuAspect01|Lord Hades Has Guan Yu Aspect 01|Hades|No, let's not. Gigaros is the mightier weapon, with none of the treacherous past. It needs no fanciful shape-shifting tricks to run you through. Behold!
LordHadesHasArthurAspect01|Lord Hades Has Arthur Aspect 01|Hades|I never had any respect for Stygius, that blade you bear. Perhaps unfairly, due to Brother Poseidon's sloppy form when once he wielded it. But now it seems quite different in your care.
LordHadesHasArthurAspect01|Lord Hades Has Arthur Aspect 01|Zagreus|I think we've grown quite close to one another, yes. Enough to where I've come to know a different side of this fine blade right here. This is the aspect of some Arthur fellow! Maybe the two of you could get acquainted properly?
LordHadesHasArthurAspect01|Lord Hades Has Arthur Aspect 01|Hades|*Arthur! *No name either of gods or kings of any realm I know. Then, introduce us, as you say! To this new amateur, to whom your blade rendered its services.
LordHadesHasRamaAspect01|Lord Hades Has Rama Aspect 01|Hades|The bow is the weapon of a coward, boy. I said so even to Hera's face. I'm unsurprised that you are drawn to it, and yet... something has changed about it, I can tell.
LordHadesHasRamaAspect01|Lord Hades Has Rama Aspect 01|Zagreus|What, you mean that Coronacht has taken on the aspect of a divine preserver person of some sort, of whom I've seen mere glimpses but seems definitely very capable, and really rather brave?
LordHadesHasRamaAspect01|Lord Hades Has Rama Aspect 01|Hades|I know not why the old Infernal Arms endear themselves to you. And, I entirely care not in whose weakling aspect you bring them forth, only to fall to me.
LordHadesHasBeowulfAspect01|Lord Hades Has Beowulf Aspect 01|Hades|There you are, bearing my brother's blasted shield... flaunting it about so recklessly. Though, what have you done to it, now?
LordHadesHasBeowulfAspect01|Lord Hades Has Beowulf Aspect 01|Zagreus|Not much, really, besides awakening the aspect of a supposedly unstoppable, dragon-slaying warrior called Beowulf. If it has the power to protect him against a giant lizard, I figure it may help me against you.
LordHadesHasBeowulfAspect01|Lord Hades Has Beowulf Aspect 01|Hades|You presently shall find I'm no mere giant lizard, boy. Though we shall see whether this Beowulf is any help to you.
LordHadesHasGilgameshAspect01|Lord Hades Has Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Hades|Resorting to mere fisticuffs with me... though, how you got Malphon to look like that, I've no idea. Pray tell, whose monstrous claws are those? A manticore's?
LordHadesHasGilgameshAspect01|Lord Hades Has Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|These claws, I'll have you know, Father, belonged once to an ancient god-king known as Gilgamesh. You ever meet?
LordHadesHasGilgameshAspect01|Lord Hades Has Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Hades|*Hrm*. Provided he was flesh and blood at some point, then he resides within my realm. Presumably within Elysium somewhere, sadly bereft of his manticore claws, thanks to you. Come, show me what they can do.
LordHadesHasLuciferAspect01|Lord Hades Has Lucifer Aspect 01|Hades|You approach me with that loathsome Rail, boy. Emanating a hellish fury more even than usual, at that. Little surprise you took a shine to it. It was the weapon that I hated most of all.
LordHadesHasLuciferAspect01|Lord Hades Has Lucifer Aspect 01|Zagreus|Well, someone called Lucifer apparently thought differently, and took a crack at his own father with it, once. This one's for him, then.
LordHadesHasLuciferAspect01|Lord Hades Has Lucifer Aspect 01|Hades|Invoking names you know nothing about. Presuming, all the while, far too much. You take that monstrous artifact for another friend? You would be wiser to be wary of its influence. But, let us fight.
LordHadesMiscEncounter05|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 05|Hades|*Ah*, but there you are, boy, finally. Despite my knowing you are always late for everything, here you've outdone yourself by quite some time.
LordHadesMiscEncounter05|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 05|Zagreus|Oh shut up, and get your fork, and burn away that regal cape, and let's get to this, then. I'd no idea you had all these capes to spare! Must have a whole entire storage chamber full of them.
LordHadesMiscEncounter05|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 05|Hades|Your mockery of me may temporarily embolden you, but achieves nothing useful, in the end.
LordHadesMiscEncounter03|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 03|Hades|This cold white substance falling slowly from the heavens. Snow, they call it. Look carefully upon each fleck. Tiny crystals! But structurally weak. They melt! This surface realm... it is held up by mine.
LordHadesMiscEncounter03|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 03|Zagreus|If you're quite finished teaching me about this snow phenomenon, can we get on with brutally trying to kill each other, here?
LordHadesMiscEncounter03|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 03|Hades|You wish to have your mortal-colored blood spill once again upon this bed of snow, then fine. Let us proceed.
LordHadesMiscEncounter06|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 06|Hades|You still have yet to see the sun itself. You know only the light of Ixion, but the sun? It is positively blinding. Hideous.
LordHadesMiscEncounter06|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 06|Zagreus|It has been snowy nightfall every single time now that you mention it. I didn't know it snowed so much up here.
LordHadesMiscEncounter06|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 06|Hades|It hasn't always. But, that's of no consequence to us. Especially when there's a raging battle to be fought.
LordHadesPostEpilogue01|Lord Hades Post Epilogue 01|Hades|If you are here, then... the Olympians must still be lending you their aid. Just as before! I scarce believe the Queen's preposterous idea worked. That all it took to settle an old score was a blasted family feast.
LordHadesPostEpilogue01|Lord Hades Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Come on, Father, even you must have enjoyed that feast to some extent. We ought to do it more often! Good thing you trusted Mother's judgment on that one. So, then, to the death, once more?
LordHadesPostEpilogue01|Lord Hades Post Epilogue 01|Hades|Indeed. To the death, as always, boy. Zagreus. Ready yourself.
LordHadesEncounter01|Lord Hades Encounter 01|Hades|...I never grew accustomed to the air, up here. It gusts senselessly whichever way it pleases. I suppose you must prefer it to the stillness of the air below.
LordHadesEncounter01|Lord Hades Encounter 01|Zagreus|You know, you're right. The air up here seems pretty good so far. But I will reserve judgment till I've had my fill. I have to say, though, Father: The Helm of Darkness suits you. I'm touched you'd dust it off on my account.
LordHadesEncounter01|Lord Hades Encounter 01|Hades|It should not have had to come to this. For all your antics with me and around the House, I always kept my temper, have I not? Unlike you.
LordHadesEncounter01|Lord Hades Encounter 01|Zagreus|Well, let's see. You've berated me repeatedly and often. You've lied to me. Mustered your wretched forces to kill me, over and over. But, sure, I'll grant you that you've always kept most of your anger bottled up. All that's about to change, then?
LordHadesEncounter01|Lord Hades Encounter 01|Hades|We're gods, boy. Killing one another is our lot. Although, I always thought I was above it. I told you that you cannot leave this place. It seems I must enforce my rules myself. I'm sending you home, now.
LordHadesEncounter01_B|Lord Hades Encounter 01 B|Hades|...I never grew accustomed to the air, up here. It gusts senselessly whichever way it pleases. I suppose you must prefer it to the stillness of the air below.
LordHadesEncounter01_B|Lord Hades Encounter 01 B|Zagreus|You know, you're right. The air up here seems pretty good so far. But I will reserve judgment till I've had my fill. I have to say, though, Father: The Helm of Darkness suits you. I'm touched you'd dust it off on my account.
LordHadesEncounter01_B|Lord Hades Encounter 01 B|Hades|It should not have had to come to this. For all your antics with me and around the House, I always kept my temper, have I not? Unlike you.
LordHadesEncounter01_B|Lord Hades Encounter 01 B|Zagreus|Well let's see. You've berated me repeatedly and often. You've lied to me. Mustered a bunch of incompetent wretches to try to kill me. But, sure, I'll grant you that you've always kept most of your anger bottled up. All that's about to change, then?
LordHadesEncounter01_B|Lord Hades Encounter 01 B|Hades|We're gods, boy. Killing one another is our lot. Although, I always thought I was above it. I told you that you cannot leave this place. It seems I must enforce my rules myself. I'm sending you home, now.
LordHadesEncounter_YouDefeated01|Lord Hades Encounter You Defeated 01|Hades|You know now what you're doing here is without any purpose whatsoever. Even if I don't slay you myself, you'll simply perish when you cross that threshold there. And yet you still persist?
LordHadesEncounter_YouDefeated01|Lord Hades Encounter You Defeated 01|Zagreus|I do. Besides, making these treks helps pass the time during the ongoing Underworld renovations. And I'll be in tiptop shape once they're complete!
LordHadesEncounter_YouDefeated01|Lord Hades Encounter You Defeated 01|Hades|Would that we had a little more support; the renovations could have been complete by now! As ever, you think only of yourself. But if you must insist like this, then you will find me waiting for you once you get here. Every single time.
LordHadesEncounter_DoneTalking01|Lord Hades Encounter Done Talking 01|Hades|Why? Why do you keep showing up? In spite of knowing that the outcome shall be just the same as how it always was?
LordHadesEncounter_DoneTalking01|Lord Hades Encounter Done Talking 01|Zagreus|Beats having to toil away under your overbearing supervision. And besides, as you may be aware, I've recently made up my mind to leave this place.
LordHadesEncounter_DoneTalking01|Lord Hades Encounter Done Talking 01|Hades|*Eughh*... utterly incorrigible. When next we meet here, then, we'll keep it brief. I have grown weary of our aimless conversations. Now prepare!
LordHadesHadesKeepsakeReaction01|Lord Hades Hades Keepsake Reaction 01|Hades|You bear the Sigil of the Dead. I wear the Helm of Darkness. Even devoid of artifacts as these, we fight here without witnesses... in shadow.
LordHadesHadesKeepsakeReaction01|Lord Hades Hades Keepsake Reaction 01|Zagreus|If only everybody knew you had a mighty son most capable of cutting you down to size, with or without the ability to vanish suddenly.
LordHadesHadesKeepsakeReaction01|Lord Hades Hades Keepsake Reaction 01|Hades|A very boastful son, who often thinks too much of his ability. Come, then! I'll make you vanish suddenly.
LordHadesPersephoneKeepsakeReaction01|Lord Hades Persephone Keepsake Reaction 01|Hades|...That pomegranate blossom... I caught its subtle scent as you approached. The Queen has her mother's strength. And much more self control.
LordHadesPersephoneKeepsakeReaction01|Lord Hades Persephone Keepsake Reaction 01|Zagreus|What, you're afraid of a little flower, now, Father? One that imbues me with the fiercest might of Olympus, granted, but still! It looks harmless, at least.
LordHadesPersephoneKeepsakeReaction01|Lord Hades Persephone Keepsake Reaction 01|Hades|I fear your little flower there much more than you. The Queen and her mother... they possess power over life. Thus, power over death.
LordHadesExtremeMeasures02|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 02|Hades|Extreme measures permitted, even still? You must have forgotten to change the conditions of your Pact of Punishment.
LordHadesExtremeMeasures02|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 02|Zagreus|Wasn't an oversight. You're strong, Father. I want to be as strong, and more. Not that I'm taking after you, or anything.
LordHadesExtremeMeasures02|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 02|Hades|You wish to test yourself against the full extent of my wrath, then very well. You have earned that right. Besides yourself, only the Titans have. Now, then... *attack*!
LordHadesExtremeMeasures03|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 03|Hades|You vanquished me... even when I threw everything I had at you, and more. I fought you as I fought the Titans themselves, and still I failed.
LordHadesExtremeMeasures03|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 03|Zagreus|Oh, don't take it so hard, Father. There's always next time, right? Meaning, this time. Maybe I won't be so fortunate.
LordHadesExtremeMeasures03|Lord Hades Extreme Measures 03|Hades|Of that, I am most certain. Come, let us see the limits of our abilities, then. I warn you: I shall hold nothing back. To the death!
LordHadesNoBoonsReaction01|Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 01|Hades|...Nary a whif of Mount Olympus on you, this time. How is it that you clambered all this way, without the generous support of your dear family? Doubtless you merely purged their blessings for some coin.
LordHadesNoBoonsReaction01|Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 01|Zagreus|Hey, I resent that, Father! I'm more than capable of getting here all on my own, now, thanks.
LordHadesNoBoonsReaction01|Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 01|Hades|Such arrogance has led to many a mortal's downfall... and many a god's.
LordHadesNoBoonsReaction02|Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 02|Hades|Odd. No stink of Olympus on you, this time. Have you truly come all this way without assistance from your relatives? Or were you overzealous at a Pool of Purging?
LordHadesNoBoonsReaction02|Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 02|Zagreus|Wouldn't you like to know? Not even Nyx believed that I could come this far without aid from the Olympians. Maybe I just have a knack for proving everybody wrong.
LordHadesNoBoonsReaction02|Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 02|Hades|You have a *knack *for being struck down in various, ignoble ways, that much is certain. Come, then! Show me what you, yourself, can do!
LordHadesAboutFishing01|Lord Hades About Fishing 01|Hades|Be still. These waters... teeming with Poseidon's river denizens. That one there, before me... it's been taunting me, I think, for quite some time.
LordHadesAboutFishing01|Lord Hades About Fishing 01|Zagreus|You offering to take me *fishing*, Father? Sounds more pleasant than having you slaughter me again, or the other way around.
LordHadesAboutFishing01|Lord Hades About Fishing 01|Hades|You mistook my meaning. First, *you *shall have my spear. Then, that thing shall, if it has not yet come to its senses. Though, if you vanquish me, I'm certain your uncle shall not mind if you extract it, yourself.
LordHadesPactHighHeatReaction01|Lord Hades Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Hades|It is a testament to the awful might of Demeter that, even with the surge of heat created by the Pact of Punishment you toy with recklessly, this place remains a frozen waste.
LordHadesPactHighHeatReaction01|Lord Hades Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Zagreus|The Pact did make the road here a little more fraught than usual. But if it couldn't stop me, I can't imagine it could stop Demeter.
LordHadesPactHighHeatReaction01|Lord Hades Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Hades|Forget her, and the blasted Pact. I'll stop you, myself.
LordHadesWinterCurseReaction01|Lord Hades Winter Curse Reaction 01|Hades|Enjoying the delicate warmth of the surface, b-- Zagreus? Apparently, the generosity of the goddess of seasons knows no bounds.
LordHadesWinterCurseReaction01|Lord Hades Winter Curse Reaction 01|Zagreus|Does feel a bit different, maybe. Though, Demeter said something about how this spot, in particular, would remain bereft of warmth, as a reminder. Do you think she knows what happened with Mother, really?
LordHadesWinterCurseReaction01|Lord Hades Winter Curse Reaction 01|Hades|Demeter may harbor vengeful feelings and suspicions, but she is no fool. Experience teaches us to know when to quit. Though, evidently, that is a lesson you have yet to learn.
LordHadesLowHealth01|Lord Hades Low Health 01|Hades|Look at yourself, boy. You barely stand, and yet believe you can surpass me in your current state?
LordHadesLowHealth01|Lord Hades Low Health 01|Zagreus|It's not exactly easy getting here, you know. But I'm not going back. Not yet.
LordHadesLowHealth01|Lord Hades Low Health 01|Hades|Perhaps not yet. But very, very soon.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade01|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Hades|Varatha... I recognize its presence, now. That's not just any three-pronged lance you wield. I could never stand to look at it, once my brothers and my sisters and myself... once our foul work was done.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade01|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Zagreus|You mean once you'd chopped up your cruel and overbearing Titan parents, right? Shame you threw it out. It's quite useful.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade01|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Hades|Perhaps the Fates decided that its wielders ought to all eventually wind up on its receiving end. Come, then! Let us see what the great Achilles has taught you.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade02|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 02|Hades|So! You think that you can vanquish me with my fool brother's old, forgotten blade. Poseidon was never any good with Stygius. Grew envious of my spearwork. Now he's famous for that fork of his! Always taking credit where none is due.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade02|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 02|Zagreus|Must be hard, knowing that everybody's going to think you learned your spearwork from Poseidon, not the other way around. As for Stygius, I can assure you it's in good hands now.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade02|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 02|Hades|Your assurances mean nothing to me, boy. You think yourself quite capable? Then show me.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade03|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 03|Hades|You come here bearing brother Zeus' Aegis. I wonder how much more insulting you could be.
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade03|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 03|Zagreus|What? I haven't even started to insult you here yet, Father. Flustered by the old Shield of Chaos, then?
LordHadesHasWeaponUpgrade03|Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 03|Hades|Doubtless Zeus does not even remember wielding it. I never should have relied on him for anything after that! Then, come. Let's see if you're any better with it than your great uncle.
LordHadesAboutEternalWinter01|Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01|Hades|*Hrm*. It grew distinctly colder just as you arrived. So *Demeter *has been in contact with you, then. That witch. Tell me how much she knows.
LordHadesAboutEternalWinter01|Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01|Zagreus|What? I don't... wait, this everlasting winter, it's her doing, isn't it? Why? Don't mortals die when it's cold? Sounds like a lot of extra work for you.
LordHadesAboutEternalWinter01|Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01|Hades|Then you are ignorant. Keep it that way, with her. Lest you risk everything, you understand? The consequences would be far worse than a foul stretch of weather. But, enough talk, now.
LordHadesAboutEternalWinter01_B|Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01 B|Hades|Hrm. It grew distinctly colder just as you arrived. So Demeter has been in contact with you, then. That witch. Tell me how much she knows.
LordHadesAboutEternalWinter01_B|Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01 B|Zagreus|She lost her daughter... who's my mother. But, Demeter still thinks I'm Nyx's son, and... what have you done, Father? This everlasting winter, it's her doing, isn't it? Freezing mortals to death. Why don't you stop this?
LordHadesAboutEternalWinter01_B|Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01 B|Hades|The two of you know nothing, then, it seems. Keep it that way, especially with her. Lest you risk everything, you understand? The consequences would be far worse than a foul stretch of weather. But, enough talk, now.
LordHadesMiscEncounter01|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 01|Hades|...The sea... the heavens, and the earth. All of this belongs to my brothers. We are their kin by birth. But we are foreigners in their country.
LordHadesMiscEncounter01|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 01|Zagreus|No. No mournful speeches. Now get out of my way.
LordHadesMiscEncounter01|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 01|Hades|You impertinent brat. Fine. Impulsiveness runs in the family.
LordHadesMiscEncounter02|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 02|Hades|There was a time when Cerberus would never have permitted any soul to exit through that gateway there behind you.
LordHadesMiscEncounter02|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 02|Zagreus|Oh, that can't possibly be true! What about Orpheus, Theseus, Heracles, Odysseus? Countless tales of brave men delving into the Underworld, then leaving whence they came!
LordHadesMiscEncounter02|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 02|Hades|They left on my authority alone. Nor did they take for granted my good graces. You believe you are entitled simply to walk out of here. From your birthright and your responsibilities! But I am here to tell you, *no*.
LordHadesMiscEncounter04|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 04|Hades|My brothers and my sisters and myself. We, too, wanted to slay our parents. The Titans. Bastards. And worse.
LordHadesMiscEncounter04|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 04|Zagreus|And you succeeded. Chopped up some of them into many tiny bits, and sprinkled them throughout the pits of Tartarus so that they can't regenerate! Or so I hear. Inspiring, really!
LordHadesMiscEncounter04|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 04|Hades|We had no recourse at the time, save to collaborate. Developed a specific plan, and saw it through. And, the Titans...? You think me cruel, yet know nothing of cruelty. But, here, you want something to hate, then have it!
LordHadesMiscEncounter07|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 07|Hades|I must admit to something, boy. Achilles taught you reasonably well. I expected that if anyone could train you into martial competence, it would be him.
LordHadesMiscEncounter07|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 07|Zagreus|Though you didn't expect that, one day, I would end up using everything I learned from him against *you*.
LordHadesMiscEncounter07|Lord Hades Misc Encounter 07|Hades|I anticipate more than you know. But Achilles merely practiced against mortals. Now, you practice against *me*.
LordHadesMiscStart01|Lord Hades Misc Start 01|Hades|Come all this way again, to fall to me? Would that you paid me such respects back at the House.
LordHadesMiscStart02|Lord Hades Misc Start 02|Hades|What is it going to take for you to understand that your place is in the House?!
LordHadesMiscStart03|Lord Hades Misc Start 03|Hades|I shall give you no quarter, boy. Although I doubt that you expected otherwise.
LordHadesMiscStart04|Lord Hades Misc Start 04|Hades|The sea and air are very still this eve. Though I suppose that is about to change.
LordHadesMiscStart05|Lord Hades Misc Start 05|Hades|Know only that I take no pleasure in what I am now forced to do.
LordHadesMiscStart06|Lord Hades Misc Start 06|Hades|There you are. Then let us now commence this ugly business yet again.
LordHadesMiscStart07|Lord Hades Misc Start 07|Hades|The heavens and the seas belong to my brothers; but know that you are still in *my *domain.
LordHadesMiscStart08|Lord Hades Misc Start 08|Hades|You bypassed Cerberus again, I see. Unfortunately for the both of us.
LordHadesMiscStart09|Lord Hades Misc Start 09|Hades|I had other pressing business to attend to. But I cannot let you leave.
LordHadesMiscStart10|Lord Hades Misc Start 10|Hades|No matter how many times you try, your stubbornness shall get you nowhere with me.
LordHadesMiscStart11|Lord Hades Misc Start 11|Hades|You're back, with Stygius in hand. Come then, and show me your technique!
LordHadesMiscStart12|Lord Hades Misc Start 12|Hades|The Blade of the Underworld cannot help you here, you realize that, boy?
LordHadesMiscStart13|Lord Hades Misc Start 13|Hades|Your heart-seeking Coronacht may have brought you this far, but shall not help you, here.
LordHadesMiscStart14|Lord Hades Misc Start 14|Hades|That heart-seeking bow you wield... it is nothing but a tool for cowards, boy.
LordHadesMiscStartWithSpear01|Duo - Start and Spear (1)|Hades|So, Varatha and Gigaros are to clash again upon this empty field. Let us have at it, then.
LordHadesMiscStartWithSpear02|Duo - Start and Spear (2)|Hades|I knew someday the Eternal Spear would turn on me. Let's see you wield it, boy.
LordHadesMiscStart15|Lord Hades Misc Start 15|Hades|The Shield of Chaos... what a monstrous thing. How suitable for you.
LordHadesMiscStart16|Lord Hades Misc Start 16|Hades|You bear the Aegis so much like your uncle Zeus once did.
LordHadesMiscStart17|Lord Hades Misc Start 17|Hades|You think the Rail of Adamant can vanquish me? We'll momentarily find out.
LordHadesMiscStart18|Lord Hades Misc Start 18|Hades|You would take aim at me with Exagryph? Then, very well.
LordHadesMiscStart19|Lord Hades Misc Start 19|Hades|You would attack me with the savagery of the Twin Fists? Then, come.
LordHadesMiscStart20|Lord Hades Misc Start 20|Hades|Again, you seek to use the power of Malphon against me. Fine.
LordHadesMiscStart21|Lord Hades Misc Start 21|Hades|You are predictable in your arrivals here. Less so during the fight itself.
LordHadesMiscStart22|Lord Hades Misc Start 22|Hades|I was just thinking on when last I vanquished you. Come, refresh my memory.
LordHadesMiscStart23|Lord Hades Misc Start 23|Hades|No matter how often you defeat me, I shall face you here.
LordHadesMiscStart24|Lord Hades Misc Start 24|Hades|Remember, I can always get here much, much faster than you.
LordHadesMiscStart25|Lord Hades Misc Start 25|Hades|No matter how quickly you're able to get here, I shall be waiting.
LordHadesMiscStart26|Lord Hades Misc Start 26|Hades|Again, you draw me from all my responsibilities back at the House.
LordHadesMiscStart27|Lord Hades Misc Start 27|Hades|I cannot let you go, boy. Some night such as this one, you'll understand.
LordHadesMiscStart28|Lord Hades Misc Start 28|Hades|I shall be interested to see if you can vanquish me again, here, boy.
LordHadesMiscStart29|Lord Hades Misc Start 29|Hades|Come, show me everything you've learned of how to fight.
LordHadesMiscStart30|Lord Hades Misc Start 30|Hades|You've slipped by Cerberus again, I see. Then, draw your weapon, boy.
LordHadesMiscStart31|Lord Hades Misc Start 31|Hades|I see it's time again that we begin our bloody business here.
LordHadesMiscStart32|Lord Hades Misc Start 32|Hades|This blasted place... how can you even stand it on the surface, here?
LordHadesMiscStart33|Lord Hades Misc Start 33|Hades|Who shall be first to return home this time, do you suppose?
LordHadesMiscStart34|Lord Hades Misc Start 34|Hades|It seems it's time again I sent you home, myself.
LordHadesMiscStart35|Lord Hades Misc Start 35|Hades|Your rampage through my realm ends here and now.
LordHadesMiscStart36|Lord Hades Misc Start 36|Hades|I thought you might arrive right about now. Then, let us have our fight.
LordHadesMiscStart37|Lord Hades Misc Start 37|Hades|You'll go not one step farther past this threshold, boy.
LordHadesMiscStart38|Lord Hades Misc Start 38|Hades|The world beyond my realm is not for you. You're going home.
LordHadesMiscStart40|Lord Hades Misc Start 40|Hades|I wonder, boy, who's going to kill whom this time around.
LordHadesMiscStart41|Lord Hades Misc Start 41|Hades|I cannot fathom why you wish to die repeatedly like this.
LordHadesPostEndingStart01|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 01|Hades|Already here? It seems our Underworld still has many failings I shall have to deal with, after this.
LordHadesPostEndingStart02|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 02|Hades|Come show your father what you've learned of late. Do not hold back.
LordHadesPostEndingStart03|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 03|Hades|Would that you cleaned your chambers with the same devotion you show getting to these heights.
LordHadesPostEndingStart04|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 04|Hades|Untold murderous wretches in my realm, all at my beck and call, yet still you made it here.
LordHadesPostEndingStart05|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 05|Hades|You have circumvented all of my security measures again. But can you get through *me*?
LordHadesPostEndingStart06|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 06|Hades|I trust you have retained enough of your strength through this ordeal to make this worth our while?
LordHadesPostEndingStart07|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 07|Hades|Catch your breath if necessary, and then let us see if you shall earn your bonus for this day.
LordHadesPostEndingStart08|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 08|Hades|*Bah*! Not one of my overseers managed to stop you, again? Must I do everything myself?
LordHadesPostEndingStart09|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 09|Hades|I've other work to get to! Arm yourself, and let us end this quickly, boy.
LordHadesPostEndingStart10|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 10|Hades|It seems our realm has many weaknesses. I shall deal with them shortly, then.
LordHadesPostEndingStart11|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 11|Hades|Let us see if the support you're getting from Olympus amounts to anything of use.
LordHadesPostEndingStart12|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 12|Hades|Blast, but you're persistent, even now! Though let us see how strong you are, as well.
LordHadesPostEndingStart13|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 13|Hades|I should be getting back to my desk. But I suppose the work can wait.
LordHadesPostEndingStart14|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 14|Hades|*Ah*, there you are, boy! I was beginning to think I'd need a thicker cloak.
LordHadesPostEndingStart15|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 15|Hades|Well, Zagreus. Even if I vanquish you, arriving here is a sufficient feat.
LordHadesPostEndingStart16|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 16|Hades|I must admit, this is a welcome change of pace from all the parchmentwork.
LordHadesPostEndingStart17|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 17|Hades|I suppose that you must be eager to repay me for last time, then?
LordHadesPostEndingStart18|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 18|Hades|I expect I shall be able to vanquish you again. Though, we shall see.
LordHadesPostEndingStart19|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 19|Hades|Perhaps the blasted Fates shall favor *me*, for once.
LordHadesPostEndingStart20|Lord Hades Post Ending Start 20|Hades|Our last exchange left much to be desired, for my part. But this time, we shall see.
LordHadesR1FirstWin|Lord Hades R 1 First Win|Hades|...*Tsch*. To have been brought this low... by my own ungrateful child. I would expect such treatment from my brothers, but from you...? *Nrrrgghhh*....
LordHadesNextStageMisc01|Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 01|Hades|...Such contempt, for your own father. But we are not finished here, yet.
LordHadesNextStageMisc02|Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 02|Hades|...Your youth provides you with a certain mindless strength. But, such power has its limits.
LordHadesNextStageMisc03|Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 03|Hades|...Now that we had our little warm-up, it is time that we began in earnest.
LordHadesNextStageMisc04|Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 04|Hades|...You strike at your own father. What choice does that leave me.
LordHadesNextStageMisc05|Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 05|Hades|...*Hmph*. All right, then, boy. You've stirred my anger suitably, by now.
LordHadesFinalStage01|Lord Hades Final Stage 01|Hades|*Urgh*... no... I'm... not... finished... with you... *yet*!!
LordHadesFirstDefeat|Lord Hades First Defeat|Hades|I... how... you.... Go. Go, then. *Go*!! Get out of here! Get out!
LordHadesFirstDefeat|Lord Hades First Defeat|Zagreus|I told you that I would, Father. And I'm going to. Goodbye.
LordHadesFirstDefeat|Lord Hades First Defeat|Hades|...Wait. Wait, just... if you... if you find her. If you somehow find her? Tell her something for me, tell her... Tell her Cerberus is doing very well.
LordHadesFirstDefeat|Lord Hades First Defeat|Zagreus|What? Wait. I don't think I owe you any favors, here. Though, answer me one question, and I'll give it some thought, how's that?
LordHadesFirstDefeat|Lord Hades First Defeat|Hades|...I know your question, boy. But, ask it anyway.
LordHadesFirstDefeat|Lord Hades First Defeat|Zagreus|Persephone. My mother. Why did she leave?
LordHadesFirstDefeat|Lord Hades First Defeat|Hades|...I... urgh... blood and darkness...
LordHadesDefeated02|Lord Hades Defeated 02|Zagreus|You're not going to cooperate with me on this, are you? Even now, knowing Mother wants to see me again?
LordHadesDefeated02|Lord Hades Defeated 02|Hades|*Urgh*! Blast you... you shall ruin everything... with all your damnable questions!
LordHadesDefeated02|Lord Hades Defeated 02|Zagreus|Then, die, already. And get the hell out of my way.
LordHadesChaosSurfaceQuestDefeat01|Lord Hades Chaos Surface Quest Defeat 01|Hades|...Blast you, boy... we should have never sprung from Chaos... none of this...
LordHadesExtremeMeasuresDefeat01|Lord Hades Extreme Measures Defeat 01|Hades|*Urgh*.... *<Gasp> *How... I... I went all out! And still...?
LordHadesMiscDefeat01|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 01|Hades|Blast you, boy. You think you are superior to me? You are a fool.
LordHadesMiscDefeat02|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 02|Hades|*Urgh...! *With your youth comes a certain strength, it seems.
LordHadesMiscDefeat03|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 03|Hades|*Tsch... *I... I shall see you back at home.
LordHadesMiscDefeat04|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 04|Hades|How? How is this possible, that this... *urgh!*
LordHadesMiscDefeat05|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 05|Hades|*Ungh... *The world you seek out there... it's even crueler than the one you know.
LordHadesMiscDefeat06|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 06|Hades|*Augh! *Why... I was much stronger once, than this...
LordHadesMiscDefeat07|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 07|Hades|*Aah, blast*! That you of all my kin would be the one, to do this, to me....
LordHadesMiscDefeat08|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 08|Hades|*Mmph*... No matter how many times you beat me... we're family. There's no escaping that.
LordHadesMiscDefeat09|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 09|Hades|Again, you have defeated me, somehow. And yet...
LordHadesMiscDefeat10|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 10|Hades|What shall it take... what shall it take for you to...
LordHadesMiscDefeat11|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 11|Hades|*Ungh, *you... tell no one at the House. Do you hear me?
LordHadesMiscDefeat12|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 12|Hades|*Rrngh*, you stubborn... you shrug off death as though it means nothing to you...!
LordHadesMiscDefeat13|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 13|Hades|...I shall keep coming back... the same as you...!
LordHadesMiscDefeat14|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 14|Hades|You... you think that you're the only one... who shall keep fighting?
LordHadesMiscDefeat15|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 15|Hades|I must admit... you've learned something. At some point, in all this.
LordHadesMiscDefeat16|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 16|Hades|*Urgh*... were it not for all my wretched kin upon Olympus, you...
LordHadesMiscDefeat17|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 17|Hades|*Rngh*, vanquished again... by my own fool kin....
LordHadesMiscDefeat18|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 18|Hades|*Guh*! Boy, you speak none of this, to anyone!
LordHadesMiscDefeat19|Lord Hades Misc Defeat 19|Hades|*Urgh*! How did... you accomplish this...?

BossCharonAboutHermesQuest01|Boss Charon About Hermes Quest 01|Zagreus|You know, Charon, your associate Hermes apparently had a wager with you that I could beat you twice in a row at some point? I'd hate to disappoint him, so... no hard feelings?

BossCharonEncounter01|Boss Charon Encounter 01|Charon|Mmnnn*rraaauuugggghhh*!!
BossCharonEncounter01|Boss Charon Encounter 01|Zagreus|That was not an understanding sound. Wait, why are you brandishing your oar in such a menacing way?

ZeusWithAthena01|Duo - Zeus and Athena (1)|Zeus|Why, look, Zagreus, here comes brave Athena, first to reach you among all my kin, in all her shrewdness. So proactive, you contacted Zagreus prior to even telling me, my dear!
ZeusWithAthena01|Duo - Zeus and Athena (1)|Athena|Lord Father, would that I could settle even more such matters quickly and discreetly, so that only the most vital of them rise up to the level of your notice, sir. Though, I'm certain Zagreus and I are very grateful you have intervened.
ZeusWithAres01|Duo - Zeus and Ares (1)|Zeus|Nephew! By my divine authority, my oft-misunderstood son, Ares, now shall lend you a small token of his power. I'll make him helpful yet!
ZeusWithAres01|Duo - Zeus and Ares (1)|Ares|It shall be exactly as you say, Lord Father. Your wishes are identical to mine.
ZeusWithAphrodite01|Duo - Zeus and Aphrodite (1)|Zeus|Young man, I know you'd like to get to know the comely Aphrodite face to face, or I don't know, you can decide once you arrive at last! He can decide, isn't that right, my Lady Aphrodite, hm?
ZeusWithAphrodite01|Duo - Zeus and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|Why, I never, Lord Zeus! That sounded rather like a crass remark, from *you*! How shocking that the golden standard for the rest of us should have such words for *me*!
ZeusWithArtemis01|Duo - Zeus and Artemis (1)|Zeus|Now, Zagreus, once you arrive, we'll have to find for you a suitable mate, won't we? Fine young man such as yourself! Normally, there's much to choose from around here, with some exceptions, of course... such as my cunning daughter, Artemis. Willfully uninclined to take a mate, at all!
ZeusWithArtemis01|Duo - Zeus and Artemis (1)|Artemis|Yes, Zagreus, in spite of all these perfect, chiseled prospects everywhere about, yearning to marry or embarrass me, for some reason, I prefer to spend my time mostly alone or with my nymph friends in the woods!
ZeusWithDemeter01|Duo - Zeus and Demeter (1)|Zeus|Now, now, young man, whatever you have heard about good Demeter, I'm here to clear the air. She's like a sister to me, yes, but only thus. Although her Titan parents and my own met the same fate.
ZeusWithDemeter01|Duo - Zeus and Demeter (1)|Demeter|Why, Foster-Brother Zeus! Such an unlikely bit of candor there, from you! Almost as though you felt compelled to speak the truth only whilst I'm directly within earshot.
ZeusAboutLuciferAspect01|Zeus About Lucifer Aspect 01|Zeus|Have you encountered Exagryph and said to it the waking-phrase I gave to you, young man? Why, I'd tell Exagryph myself! Remember, it's *I see your prideful fall down from the heavens to the flames*.
ZeusAboutLuciferAspect02|Zeus About Lucifer Aspect 02|Zeus|Now that is an entirely unusual design, even for Exagryph! So then the waking-phrase has worked. That aspect's bearer, Lucifer, was it? Struck his own lord father! Tried to, anyway. A not uncommon story it would seem.
ZeusAboutDemeter03|Zeus About Demeter 03|Zeus|I gather Lady Demeter's already got her frigid hold on you, certainly not the warmest member of the clan, now, is she? But do be patient with her, she's been through a lot.
ZeusAboutDemeter01|Zeus About Demeter 01|Zeus|My good sister Demeter already tried to poison you against me, as I understand, young man? Oh, *foster*-sister she prefers I say, loath as she is to accept her role as part of our great family.
ZeusAboutDemeter02|Zeus About Demeter 02|Zeus|You must forgive the Lady Demeter her scornfulness, Nephew, for she is still recovering after the sudden disappearance of her daughter, though it was quite some time ago the girl, *poof*! Just vanished. I try to lighten up the mood around it every now and then, but *no*, a sore spot, still!
ZeusAboutPersephone01|Zeus About Persephone 01|Zeus|Poor Demeter, young man. We still wonder what became of her fair daughter. Ran away with mortals, there, perhaps? Some of the tales, even more preposterous. Don't go believing everything you hear, and do be sensitive about the subject, hm? Demeter, she's been through quite enough.
ZeusAboutPersephone02|Zeus About Persephone 02|Zeus|The Lady Demeter still prattles on about her missing girl, Zagreus. But I want you to understand something, all right? She's gone. We all have grieved. Perhaps Demeter shall finally accept what has occurred, and we can move forward, having grown stronger as a family.
ZeusAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Zeus About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Sure hope this works.... In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! For you, in all your splendor, Lord Uncle Zeus.
ZeusAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Zeus About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zeus|My, what is this you have for me, young man? Appears to be a message of some sort, bearing my thunder sigil! Though, there's one for everybody on Olympus? Have they as yet received their own? I must know what it says... it's from your father, who else could it be? I'd better check on this!
ZeusAboutOlympianReunionQuest02|Zeus About Olympian Reunion Quest 02|Zeus|I eagerly await learning some more about the contents of that fascinating message you had sent up here, Nephew! How mysterious, indeed. I'll be keeping an eye on all the others that come in!
ZeusPostEpilogue01|Zeus Post Epilogue 01|Zeus|I have to tell you, Zagreus, that it was wonderful to meet with you, at last! We were so pleased to learn Persephone was safe! And Nyx, why, she's as stunning as they say. Shouldn't have lied to us about your parentage, but, I know things get complicated, here, and that what's done is done!
ZeusAboutPoseidon01|Zeus About Poseidon 01|Zeus|Poseidon sought you out already, hm? My boastful brother gets on with Lord Hades even worse than I, so let me put a little spark into his storms for you!
ZeusAboutAthena01|Zeus About Athena 01|Zeus|My brave daughter Athena beat me to you this time, has she? No matter, with her blessing and my own, you shall be nigh unstoppable!
ZeusAboutAphrodite01|Zeus About Aphrodite 01|Zeus|Has lovely Aphrodite put you in a trance already, Zagreus? Or might I offer you the blessing of Olympus to intensify her catastrophic power with my own?
ZeusAboutArtemis01|Zeus About Artemis 01|Zeus|So my elusive Artemis has shown you favor, has she? The little scamp, she seldom shows respect to anyone, not even me! But I'll enhance her blessing nonetheless.
ZeusAboutAres01|Zeus About Ares 01|Zeus|Getting along with Ares, are you, Nephew? *Heh*. Would that you were my son instead of he, but no, I jest, I jest! Here, take my blessing, please!
ZeusAboutDionysus01|Zeus About Dionysus 01|Zeus|It pleases me to know, young man, that you and Dionysus have been getting on so well. He could use a level-headed friend, and you could use my blessing!
ZeusAboutHermes01|Zeus About Hermes 01|Zeus|*Hmm*! You've traveled rather quickly to this point... which reminds me, I've not seen swift Hermes anywhere of late! The rascal's likely dallying about!
ZeusAboutHades01|Zeus About Hades 01|Zeus|Nephew, I have somewhat of a favor I must ask. You tell your father, if you so happen to run into him again, that his brother Zeus forgives him, and would like to reconnect, and welcome him into the family again. You tell him for me, hm?
ZeusBackstory01|Zeus Backstory 01|Zeus|So you are son to Hades by that Nyx, the night-goddess, is that correct, Nephew...? Well I suppose she's closest to a queen as your lord father's like to find down there. I tried to match him up with some more wholesome types, but no, and here we are.
ZeusBackstory02|Zeus Backstory 02|Zeus|After we learned about your plight and your existence from the goddess Nyx, all of us on Olympus rallied to assist you just as best we could. A family such as mine protects its own!
ZeusBackstory03|Zeus Backstory 03|Zeus|My brothers Hades and Poseidon once fought bravely by my side, you know that, don't you, Nephew? We prevailed against the Titans and established law upon the earth. Your father then descended to the land of death, and we've not seen much of each other since.
ZeusBackstory04|Zeus Backstory 04|Zeus|Your father must have told you that his governance over the Underworld is due more to the weaving of the Fates than by his choice. Admittedly, he got the short end of the stick. Whereas Poseidon and myself, why, we've been doing rather well indeed.
ZeusBackstory05|Zeus Backstory 05|Zeus|My brother Hades always was a lonesome man, you know. I pitied him! But I could never quite extract him from his thorny shell. Now he stews resentfully down there. You needn't bear the brunt of his frustrations.
ZeusBackstory06|Zeus Backstory 06|Zeus|Old Hades has continued to ignore my every effort to reach out to him, young man. Ah well, but he is obstinate, indeed. You are wise to seek your family's better half.
ZeusAboutNyx01|Zeus About Nyx 01|Zeus|By the way, Nephew, I hear-tell your mother Nyx is quite the catch! If you'll forgive my saying so, of course. Your father's never had much of a sensibility around companionship, though perhaps this concubine of his brought something out in him, at last!
ZeusRunProgress01|Zeus Run Progress 01|Zeus|If and when you reach the surface, Zagreus, you call upon me then and there, all right? I'll personally see to it that you'll be escorted up to Olympus, and your quest shall be complete!
ZeusRunProgress02|Zeus Run Progress 02|Zeus|I know just how much you must want out of there, young man. And I want that as well! *Heh*. Good thing for you, as I get what I want around here. Ask anybody!
ZeusHasWeapon01|Zeus Has Weapon 01|Zeus|You fight your father's legions with Varatha, the Eternal Spear? The irony must not escape him, for he long ago stood by my side against the Titans, with that thing in hand!
ZeusHasWeapon02|Zeus Has Weapon 02|Zeus|It seems the bow called Coronacht is safe and sound there in your hands, young man. I've not seen that old thing in quite some time!
ZeusHasWeapon03|Zeus Has Weapon 03|Zeus|That shield of yours, called Aegis, why, in fact, it's mine from long ago, young man! I've no more need of it, of course, though how you found it, you shall have to tell me once you're here!
ZeusHasWeapon04|Zeus Has Weapon 04|Zeus|Well, if it isn't the one and only Rail of Adamant in your possession, there! To strike one's enemies from afar is really the only way, I think, and it's about as good a substitute for lightning bolts as you're likely to find!
ZeusHasWeapon05|Zeus Has Weapon 05|Zeus|Now, isn't that Malphon the Twin Fists there in your possession, Zagreus? Last god I saw bedecked in those old gloves was Demeter herself, oh, way back when! She was a real fighter at the time, not just a naysayer!
ZeusAboutZeusAspect01|Zeus About Zeus Aspect 01|Zeus|*Ah*, now that's the Aegis that I know and love! Or *used *to love, at least, the dear old thing! Now I quite love these shocking bolts of mine. Though I am proud you've given Aegis a good home, and bear it in my name!
ZeusRevealsLuciferAspect01|Zeus Reveals Lucifer Aspect 01|Zeus|Hark, young man, for I've a vision I must share with you! A waking-phrase for Exagryph, to be precise. Please beseech the weapon thus: *I see your prideful fall down from the heavens to the flames. *An odd connection to a past or future bearer, apparently one who defied a god!
ZeusRunCleared01|Zeus Run Cleared 01|Zeus|Nephew, I wanted to mention, it was odd how by every account you'd come quite close to breaking free from there at last, of late... only to be abruptly cut off from our contact! I suppose having suffered some ill fate? Perhaps your realm's guardian, Cerberus, is even deadlier than reputed!
ZeusPostEpilogue02|Zeus Post Epilogue 02|Zeus|Your dear mother Persephone is a shrewd woman, Zagreus. More than an equal to your mighty father! I'm pleased to know you've made amends with her, and taken new responsibilities within your House! Naturally, I'll continue to pitch in. And, I hope that we'll meet again, someday!
ZeusPostEpilogue03|Zeus Post Epilogue 03|Zeus|I must say, Nephew! Although it pleases me that we, here, reconnected with your father's realm... just between us, it pleases me even more that you are able to keep sticking it to him! You keep that up, all right?
ZeusPostEpilogue04|Zeus Post Epilogue 04|Zeus|Zagreus, you have a clever mother in Persephone! A very clever mother. And a lordly father! They make quite the team, that's evident! True rivals for Hera and me!
ZeusHighAffinity01|Zeus High Affinity 01|Zeus|The lord and ruler of Olympus and the world, why, he needs a healthy sense of humor, no, young man? Now there's an awful lot of spoil-sports out here, can't take even a little joke, well, I know all their mothers, fie on all of them, I say! Let's joke away!
ZeusAboutRumors01|Zeus About Rumors 01|Zeus|I suppose even down in the Underworld, you would have heard such tales of me, young man. They're all untrue, *hahaha*! Except the tales of my bravery. Those are completely accurate, though all too modest, in most cases, I must say.
ZeusAboutKeepsake01|Zeus About Keepsake 01|Zeus|Ah, must be my gleaming Thunder Signet that I transferred to you! Why, I could feel its call from all the way up here!
ZeusLowHealth01|Zeus Low Health 01|Zeus|Why you look positively dreadful, Zagreus. That place is doing you no favors, I can tell! Luckily, I'll do you favors aplenty!
ZeusLowHealth02|Zeus Low Health 02|Zeus|You seem in dire need of some assistance, Nephew. So, of course, I dropped what I was doing and then sought you out as quickly as I could!
ZeusLowHealth03|Zeus Low Health 03|Zeus|Zagreus, you must have left most of your lifeblood back the other way, *hahahaha*! Oh, I jest, I jest! But you look *terrible*.
ZeusLowHealth04|Zeus Low Health 04|Zeus|No, no one likes to die, young man! But since you seem about to any moment now, you keep your head held high, do you hear me?
ZeusLowHealth05|Zeus Low Health 05|Zeus|Well, let's face it, Zagreus, you are as good as dead right now. But you'll just slosh right back out of the River Styx, and give it a good try again, won't you?
ZeusLowHealth06|Zeus Low Health 06|Zeus|Remember, young man, dying is for mortals. So don't go making a habit of it, there! But if you have to do it, do it fighting, like a *hero *would!
ZeusLegendaryPickUp01|Zeus Legendary Pick Up 01|Zeus|I wonder, Nephew, whether you're prepared as yet to harness the surpassing power I shall grant you now? Don't take this blessing lightly, and may you use it well.
ZeusLegendaryPickUp02|Zeus Legendary Pick Up 02|Zeus|How about, young man, we cease with all the trifling down there and cause a real storm for once? Take now the fiercest of my powers, and you show your no-good father what you're made of!
ZeusFirstPickUp|Zeus First Pick Up|Zagreus|Is this really him? OK. In the name of Hades! Olympus! I accept this message.
ZeusFirstPickUp|Zeus First Pick Up|Zeus|Greetings there, young man! Look, your father's always been rather difficult, and he's not so much as called in quite some time. You'll have a better home where you belong, here on Olympus! And to help you on your journey, have my blessing.
ZeusMiscPickup01|Zeus Misc Pickup 01|Zeus|We meet again, young man! Yours isn't my affair, I know, and yet I cannot help but take an interest in your plight. Your father cast his lot; he need not take his anger out on you.
ZeusMiscPickup02|Zeus Misc Pickup 02|Zeus|Hello, young man, and might I offer you a little taste of the heavens themselves? Though, don't go telling your old sulky father I've been spoiling you rotten!
ZeusMiscPickup03|Zeus Misc Pickup 03|Zeus|I and all of us upon Olympus are anticipating your success, dear Nephew! Now let me see if I can't help spur you along.
ZeusMiscPickup04|Zeus Misc Pickup 04|Zeus|Well, my nephew, you're admittedly in quite a bind down there, but what is life without its struggles, hm? You'll make it here, eventually, I'm certain.
ZeusMiscPickup05|Zeus Misc Pickup 05|Zeus|I like the fire in you, Zagreus, and I have every confidence you'll someday clamber from the shadows there into the light!
ZeusMiscPickup06|Zeus Misc Pickup 06|Zeus|Here on Olympus, Nephew, we take care of one another and support each other, quite unlike how it must be there in your father's grim domain. No wonder you intend to leave!
ZeusMiscPickup07|Zeus Misc Pickup 07|Zeus|I'd ask you offer my respects to your lord father, Zagreus, but I suspect you won't have such a chance anytime soon, considering how far you'll come with my support!
ZeusMiscPickup08|Zeus Misc Pickup 08|Zeus|Remember you've as many chances as it takes, young man, to fight your way out of the dark and join us in the splendor of Olympus!
ZeusMiscPickup09|Zeus Misc Pickup 09|Zeus|Your grim-faced father's such a spoilsport, Nephew, the way he keeps impeding your escape. Ah, well, just keep at it, hm?
ZeusMiscPickup10|Zeus Misc Pickup 10|Zeus|My greetings, young Nephew, and more importantly, my blessing and my strength be with you as you journey towards your rightful home.
ZeusMiscPickup11|Zeus Misc Pickup 11|Zeus|Faith and courage, Zagreus, for each and every one of us upon Olympus is behind you all the way throughout this whole affair.
ZeusMiscPickup12|Zeus Misc Pickup 12|Zeus|What can I say, young man? You may not make your father very proud, but it is just the opposite with me! Now go, get out of there!
ZeusMiscPickup13|Zeus Misc Pickup 13|Zeus|Now, Nephew, how about we put both of our backs into this one, and see to it that you go farther through those depths than you have ever managed yet!
ZeusMiscPickup14|Zeus Misc Pickup 14|Zeus|Know that many mortals ask me for my blessings constantly, and I mean all the time, young Nephew, but for you! You needn't ask at all!
ZeusMiscPickup15|Zeus Misc Pickup 15|Zeus|Far be it from me to raise my hand against your father, dear Nephew! Although I do suppose old Hades has it coming, doesn't he.
ZeusMiscPickup16|Zeus Misc Pickup 16|Zeus|I've every confidence in you, young man! Now you remember that, and take my blessing here, and fight your way on out of there for me!
ZeusMiscPickup17|Zeus Misc Pickup 17|Zeus|Nephew, I want you to go and show that surly Hades everything you're made of! And, I've arranged for you a little bit of help along the way!
ZeusMiscPickup18|Zeus Misc Pickup 18|Zeus|How is old Hades doing, anyway, Nephew? I suspect he's every bit as prickly as ever, whereas you are nothing of the sort!
ZeusMiscPickup19|Zeus Misc Pickup 19|Zeus|I eagerly anticipate getting to meet you face-to-face someday, dear Nephew, just as soon as you can up and out of there!
ZeusMiscPickup20|Zeus Misc Pickup 20|Zeus|Good Nephew, I return once more to lend to you my power! I'd like to see your discontented father try and stop you now!
ZeusMiscPickup21|Zeus Misc Pickup 21|Zeus|It is my solemn wish, dear Zagreus, that eventually we settle up our differences with your lord father. But for now, we fight!
ZeusMiscPickup22|Zeus Misc Pickup 22|Zeus|Hail, my most honorable, beloved nephew, and I bring to you the blessing of Olympus, so that you might finally get out of there, already!
ZeusMiscPickup23|Zeus Misc Pickup 23|Zeus|I just know you'll reach the surface here eventually, Zagreus! And I look forward to our meeting when you do!
ZeusMiscPickup24|Zeus Misc Pickup 24|Zeus|We'll keep you safe here from your father, Zagreus! But while you're still inside that Underworld, there's only so much we can do.
ZeusMiscPickup25|Zeus Misc Pickup 25|Zeus|You've a good head on your shoulders, Zagreus, so stay positive, stay healthy, and let nothing stand between you and your goal!
ZeusMiscPickup26|Zeus Misc Pickup 26|Zeus|I wish you well in your continued quest, and offer my sincerest blessings, and of course my power, there, Nephew!
ZeusMiscPickup27|Zeus Misc Pickup 27|Zeus|You've seen the sheer destructive power of the heavens! Just imagine what it's like above the surface of the earth!
ZeusMiscPickup28|Zeus Misc Pickup 28|Zeus|Someday when we'll be resting easy on these heights, why, we'll look back at this and laugh, I'm sure of it!
ZeusMiscPickupExtra01|Zeus Misc Pickup Extra 01|Zeus|*Ahh*, but if it isn't my most favored nephew! Striving always toward the surface of my world. Your father cannot possibly believe he can contain you, can he?
ZeusMiscPickup23_B|Zeus Misc Pickup 23 B|Zeus|You have my blessing now as ever there, young man.
ZeusMiscPickup24_B|Zeus Misc Pickup 24 B|Zeus|I trust you shall be getting out of there in due course, Nephew.
ZeusMiscPickup25_B|Zeus Misc Pickup 25 B|Zeus|I shall be watching over you, young man, though it is dark down there!
ZeusMiscPickup26_B|Zeus Misc Pickup 26 B|Zeus|May the might of Olympus guide you through the shadows, Nephew.
ZeusMiscPickup27_B|Zeus Misc Pickup 27 B|Zeus|Don't let your father get to you, young man, and climb on out from there.
ZeusMiscPickup28_B|Zeus Misc Pickup 28 B|Zeus|Zagreus, we won't be giving up on you, so you keep at it, *hm*?
ZeusMiscPickup29|Zeus Misc Pickup 29|Zeus|I shall make the heavens themselves now aid your ascent, Nephew.
ZeusMiscPickup30|Zeus Misc Pickup 30|Zeus|You'll watch yourself down there, won't you, young man?
ZeusMiscPickup31|Zeus Misc Pickup 31|Zeus|All of us, we're here for you, young man!
ZeusMiscPickup32|Zeus Misc Pickup 32|Zeus|Please do be careful not to make your situation any worse, Nephew!
ZeusMiscPickup33|Zeus Misc Pickup 33|Zeus|I'm here for you, young man, so you take heart, and more than that, take *this*!
ZeusMiscPickup34|Zeus Misc Pickup 34|Zeus|All of us believe in you, though certainly no one so much as I!
ZeusMiscPickup35|Zeus Misc Pickup 35|Zeus|Here's something I can do to help, young man!
ZeusMiscPickup36|Zeus Misc Pickup 36|Zeus|You just take all the time you need in terms of fighting your way out of there, young man!
ZeusMiscPickup37|Zeus Misc Pickup 37|Zeus|Now, don't lose heart, young man, and we'll keep at it with you here, as well!
ZeusMiscPickup38|Zeus Misc Pickup 38|Zeus|As my kin, you are a born fighter, Zagreus! So put your back into it, and you climb right up!
ZeusMiscPickup39|Zeus Misc Pickup 39|Zeus|It shall be glorious, indeed, the day you finally burst from that oppressive den into the light!
ZeusMiscPickup40|Zeus Misc Pickup 40|Zeus|I know you have it in you to surpass your father, Zagreus. Assuming you are anything like me!
ZeusMiscPickupPostEpilogue01|Zeus Misc Pickup Post Epilogue 01|Zeus|How fares your lovely mother? Things still good with her and Hades, hm?
ZeusMiscPickupPostEpilogue02|Zeus Misc Pickup Post Epilogue 02|Zeus|You tell your good lord father that his brother Zeus shall be always watching over you!
ZeusMiscPickupPostEpilogue03|Zeus Misc Pickup Post Epilogue 03|Zeus|I trust your good lord father's treating you all right?
ZeusMiscPickupPostEpilogue04|Zeus Misc Pickup Post Epilogue 04|Zeus|I know you're busy, Zagreus, though someday you shall have to visit us!
ZeusMiscPickupPostEpilogue05|Zeus Misc Pickup Post Epilogue 05|Zeus|I'm never quite so busy that I can't make time for family, young man!
ZeusMiscPickupPostEpilogue06|Zeus Misc Pickup Post Epilogue 06|Zeus|We're all in this together, aren't we, Nephew?
ZeusLootBought01|Zeus Loot Bought 01|Zeus|I see the boatman of the Underworld has found the means to reach you with my blessing, Nephew. Such strange alliances we forge these days!
ZeusLootBought02|Zeus Loot Bought 02|Zeus|Why here I am, young man, in such strange circumstances I might add! Luckily the boatman Charon is much easier to get ahold of than your father!
ZeusLootBought03|Zeus Loot Bought 03|Zeus|Ah, so then the boatman Charon came through for us after all, did he? Whatever means we have to reach you, we'll employ!
ZeusLootBought04|Zeus Loot Bought 04|Zeus|Your Charon there must drive quite a hard bargain, Zagreus, if he would keep you from your victory just for a bit of coin!
ZeusLootBought05|Zeus Loot Bought 05|Zeus|I thought that ferryman would be content to transfer souls across the River Styx, not rob you on your journey to the surface, there, Nephew!
ZeusRejection01|Zeus Rejection 01|Zeus|My blessing isn't good enough for you, is that the way of it, young man? How impetuous of you. *Oh*, I never!
ZeusRejection02|Zeus Rejection 02|Zeus|It isn't wise to go against me, Nephew, both in matters large and small. I am not known for being charitable to the insolent.
ZeusRejection03|Zeus Rejection 03|Zeus|Perhaps you have defied me here in jest, young man. Though in such cases pertinent to my authority, you'll find I lack a sense of humor.
ZeusRejection04|Zeus Rejection 04|Zeus|Audacity runs in our family, Zagreus, but my advice to you is that you keep it carefully suppressed in your relationship with me.
ZeusRejection05|Zeus Rejection 05|Zeus|What have I done, good Nephew, to deserve such scorn? Your lapse in judgment here is not so easy to forgive, yet easily punished.
ZeusRejection06|Zeus Rejection 06|Zeus|Your father likewise turned his back on me before, Nephew, and we both know what has become of him. I'd caution you against this.
ZeusRejection07|Zeus Rejection 07|Zeus|Apparently, the consequences of displeasing me have slipped your mind, young man. A harsh reminder is in order, then.
ZeusRejection08|Zeus Rejection 08|Zeus|I did not restore order to this world, and claim the heavens for myself, only to be insulted by my own nephew!
ZeusRejection09|Zeus Rejection 09|Zeus|Why, Nephew, is this all some sort of jest to you? It isn't one that I appreciate!
ZeusRejection10|Zeus Rejection 10|Zeus|Nephew, when presented with a choice to side against me or not to be such a fool, do be sure to choose the latter next time, hm?
ZeusRejection11|Zeus Rejection 11|Zeus|Don't say I didn't warn you, young man! I only wish that I could say you didn't insult me!
ZeusRejection12|Zeus Rejection 12|Zeus|This is outrageous, Zagreus! Even your father would agree that actions such as that can't go unpunished.
ZeusRejection13|Zeus Rejection 13|Zeus|Young man, I don't know why you would do this to me, though I trust you're going to think twice, next time!
ZeusRejection14|Zeus Rejection 14|Zeus|You overstep your bounds with me, Nephew! But I shall make you fall right back in line.
ZeusMakeUp01|Zeus Make Up 01|Zeus|Ah, very well, good show, young man! And I think I shall let you off the hook, and take you back under my wing, for now.
ZeusMakeUp02|Zeus Make Up 02|Zeus|Commendable of you to live through that, and I suspect you shall think twice next time before so brazenly defying me, won't you?
ZeusMakeUp03|Zeus Make Up 03|Zeus|Now, now, no need to hold such grudges any longer I suppose, but you just mind yourself around your Uncle Zeus.
ZeusMakeUp04|Zeus Make Up 04|Zeus|Do not spurn me again like that, do you hear me, young man? I think you do, so let's put this to bed and move along.
ZeusMakeUp05|Zeus Make Up 05|Zeus|Oh Nephew, but I simply can't stay wrathful toward you, much as I might try! Though, better not to tempt me, just in case.
ZeusMakeUp06|Zeus Make Up 06|Zeus|All right, all right, let's call the score between us settled up for now. Just don't go spurning me again, you understand?
ZeusMakeUp07|Zeus Make Up 07|Zeus|All right, this is becoming unproductive, Zagreus. As you were!
ZeusMakeUp08|Zeus Make Up 08|Zeus|Oh, I don't have the heart to keep exacting vengeance on you, Nephew.
ZeusMakeUp09|Zeus Make Up 09|Zeus|I say, such petty squabbles. Aren't we better than this, Zagreus?
ZeusMakeUp10|Zeus Make Up 10|Zeus|Well, young man, I'd say it's best we put this little slight behind us, wouldn't you?
ZeusMakeUp11|Zeus Make Up 11|Zeus|*Pah*! All is forgiven and forgotten, Zagreus. What were we even going on about back there?
ZeusMakeUp12|Zeus Make Up 12|Zeus|*Hahaha*, that is quite enough, that's quite enough, I say! You're still alive, aren't you?
ZeusGift01|Zeus Gift 01|Zagreus|Lord Zeus, *erm*, Uncle? Please accept this offering, and all my gratitude.
ZeusGift01|Zeus Gift 01|Zeus|Goodness, Nephew, that's an offering, indeed! I'm thankful for your piety to me, and as a show of generosity to you, in turn, I present this!
ZeusGift02|Zeus Gift 02|Zagreus|I thank you, my Lord Uncle Zeus, for your benevolence and your thunderous might.
ZeusGift02|Zeus Gift 02|Zeus|You honor me, young man, as well you should, for I am ruler of Olympus, am I not? Such courtesies are shown me constantly, yet I appreciate them all.
ZeusGift03|Zeus Gift 03|Zagreus|Lord Zeus, I bid you please accept my humble offering, for all you've done for me.
ZeusGift03|Zeus Gift 03|Zeus|Why, that is rather generous of you, and I'm grateful for it, Nephew! How good of you to make attempts at reciprocity!
ZeusGift04|Zeus Gift 04|Zagreus|This offering is but a trifle, Uncle Zeus, for all your magnanimity.
ZeusGift04|Zeus Gift 04|Zeus|So fine a gift again, my dear Nephew? Would that my sons and daughters on Olympus here would show me such respect from time to time!
ZeusGift05|Zeus Gift 05|Zagreus|Please, Lord Uncle Zeus, accept this gift of Nectar in your honor, though it is such a pittance in comparison to all the generosity you've shown.
ZeusGift05|Zeus Gift 05|Zeus|I'm very pleased to see a show of such respect and admiration for your uncle, Zagreus. You'll go quite far here on Olympus with an attitude like that! Not everyone's as mannered, nor as wise.
ZeusGift06|Zeus Gift 06|Zagreus|If you can hear me, mighty Uncle Zeus, I wish to make to you this simple gift, and with it send my humble wish that someday you and Father settle all your differences, and be at peace.
ZeusGift06|Zeus Gift 06|Zeus|*Ah*, most splendid of an offering, young man. And while we've yet to even meet in person, I already feel as though the two of us are close, why, closer than you must be even with your father! *Oh, hahaha*! Perhaps we ought go telling everybody *I'm *your real father, am I right?
ZeusGift06_B|Zeus Gift 06 B|Zagreus|If you can hear me, mighty Uncle Zeus, I wish to make to you this simple gift, and with it send my humble wish that someday you and Father settle all your differences, and be at peace.
ZeusGift06_B|Zeus Gift 06 B|Zeus|*Ah*, most splendid of an offering, young man. I already feel as though the two of us are close, why, closer than you must be even with your father! *Oh, hahaha! *Perhaps we ought go telling everybody *I'm *your real father, am I right?
ZeusGift07|Zeus Gift 07|Zagreus|King of the Olympians, Lord Zeus! Forgive this offer of Ambrosia, for I know you have no limit of it there. But here, it is the finest gift that can be given, and even still it isn't anything compared to all you've done for me. Thank you, Uncle.
ZeusGift07|Zeus Gift 07|Zeus|Now, now, Nephew, you are most generous, indeed, in showing all this deference to me. But we must keep some distance, shouldn't we? Lest all the others here, why, they would be most jealous if they caught me playing favorites! Even though you *are *my favorite! Presently, at least.
AresWithPoseidon01|Duo - Ares and Poseidon (1)|Ares|Well, my hellborn kin, I have to say that there are times I wish I could have been acquainted with your father somewhat more, if you'll forgive my saying so. My father and my uncle, here... they're predisposed quite differently than I.
AresWithPoseidon01|Duo - Ares and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|Perhaps if you were not so odd, and made more effort to be somewhat more approachable, Ares, then we'd have more in common, you and I! Should you need any tips on that, why, you just let me know!
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Ares|I wished only to speak to you in private once again, my kin, except, you see...
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Athena|...Except you see, dear Cousin, that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable. I caution you around my half-brother, is all. Now carry on.
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Ares|You interrupt me once again, dear sister. You know I do not care for that. I warn you to stay out of my affairs. I shall aid my kin as I see fit.
AresWithAthena01|Duo - Ares and Athena (1)|Athena|You only do as you see fit, Lord Ares. Mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all.
AresWithAphrodite01|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (1)|Ares|I so anticipate the day you finally arrive upon Olympus. There are few amongst us here with interests such as those I think we share.
AresWithAphrodite01|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|There are at least a few of us who share such interests here, isn't that so, Lord Ares? As for *you*, dearest, you take all the time you need!
AresWithAphrodite02|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (2)|Ares|Wars waged over love, my kin... can you imagine that? The lady Aphrodite and I can endlessly discuss such circumstances. I trust, from time to time, you stop to ask yourself how come you choose to fight. Not that you need a reason, of course.
AresWithAphrodite02|Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (2)|Aphrodite|Oh, Lord Ares, truly there isn't the need to cloud our little godling's thoughts and judgment with such comments, is there, *hm*? Let's give him what he wants, and we can carry on in private, about that.
AresWithDionysus01|Duo - Ares and Dionysus (1)|Ares|Ah, my kin! I was just inquiring with Lord Dionysus here, under which circumstances are the greatest mortal feasts of all prepared? Because I have a certain hunch, regarding that...
AresWithDionysus01|Duo - Ares and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|Yeah, yeah, Ares, I will hand it to you, man. There's nothing like a feast after a war, all right! Provided you're on the surviving side, that is! Otherwise I guess they'll be feasting with *you *down there, Zag!
AresWithDemeter01|Duo - Ares and Demeter (1)|Ares|The cold of death is quite becoming of the Goddess Demeter, do you not think so, my death-dealing kin? She is becoming well accustomed to it, too.
AresWithDemeter01|Duo - Ares and Demeter (1)|Demeter|I think that you forget yourself, Lord Ares, sir. For I am much your elder; my famines had already slain the mortals by the tens of thousands by the time such thoughts of doing so first crossed your mind.
AresKillQuestComplete|Ares Kill Quest Complete|Ares|Ten thousand souls have fallen to you, now, my hellborn kin. I am rather beside myself, I must admit. Fine work.
AresAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Ares About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Here goes, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lord Ares, please consider our proposal... once you're able to decipher it.
AresAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Ares About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Ares|My, what is this, my kin? Some sort of invitation for me, I presume. Not just for me... this symbolizes all the others, here? Most intriguing. I shall investigate the meaning of this as quickly as I'm able, then. But first!
AresPostEpilogue01|Ares Post Epilogue 01|Ares|I wish to tell you once again I had a splendid time during our recent shared festivities, my kin. At last, I've finally seen your death-filled realm firsthand! I learned a great deal. And I look forward to learning more from our successful collaboration, hm?
AresAboutZeus01|Ares About Zeus 01|Ares|Lord Zeus has gotten to you first, I see? My father's gifts are generous, indeed, though... I think I can help in my own way.
AresAboutPoseidon01|Ares About Poseidon 01|Ares|The blessing of your uncle Lord Poseidon might have helped you to this point, but here: My gift shall see you further still.
AresAboutAthena01|Ares About Athena 01|Ares|You bear the blessing of Athena, yes? She would protect you from your enemies, whilst I would rather that you slay them, and be done.
AresAboutAphrodite01|Ares About Aphrodite 01|Ares|*Mm*, I see you have the Lady Aphrodite's blessing there already. Love and death, together, hand in hand? Sounds most agreeable to me.
AresAboutArtemis01|Ares About Artemis 01|Ares|So Artemis, my lonely half-sister, got to you first? She merely helps you hunt, whilst I shall help you kill. Observe.
AresAboutDionysus01|Ares About Dionysus 01|Ares|That drunkard Dionysus cannot help you near as much as I, my hell-born kin. Compare the gift he gave to what I offer you.
AresAboutHermes01|Ares About Hermes 01|Ares|Our messenger Hermes has been in contact with you by now, yes? Perhaps you shall not see him very often, for my work keeps him rather preoccupied, shepherding souls and such.
AresAboutDemeter01|Ares About Demeter 01|Ares|I faintly sense the mark of Goddess Demeter upon you, *hm*? Her power over plentitude is opposite to mine in some respects. But, lately, she has channeled it in manners more agreeable to me.
AresAboutHadesKeepsake01|Ares About Hades Keepsake 01|Ares|Ah, you bear your own father's blessing, my kin? Such a surprise... I know the two of you are now in league, and yet... I am still quite accustomed to the thought that you harbor war-like hatred for one another. Perhaps there's still a trace of that, though, hm?
AresKillProgress01|Ares Kill Progress 01|Ares|Did you happen to know, my kin, that you have slain more than a hundred foes since you began your quest? You have! For I am keeping count. And I am most impressed.
AresKillProgress02|Ares Kill Progress 02|Ares|You are a most impressive death-dealer, my kin. For by my estimation, you have slain at least a thousand souls down there! Souls mostly having died before, but still.
AresKillQuest01|Ares Kill Quest 01|Ares|I know that you have many aspirations, my good kin. To be plain with you about my own motive for a moment: As long as you continue bringing swift and steady death, you shall have my unyielding support.
AresKillQuestAftermath01|Ares Kill Quest Aftermath 01|Ares|The more you slay your enemies, my kin, the stronger the bond between us, I think. Can you not feel it, too? Though, perhaps your lust for blood overpowers your other senses, hm?
AresAboutThanatos01|Ares About Thanatos 01|Ares|Perhaps you know a god called Thanatos? The two of us are very close associates, you know. Do give him my best wishes, should you see him soon.
AresAboutThanatos02|Ares About Thanatos 02|Ares|I trust that Thanatos is doing well? Although he brings to mortals merciful release, whilst I most certainly do *no *such thing, I do appreciate his take on it.
AresAboutThanatos03|Ares About Thanatos 03|Ares|It is my understanding that you have grown rather close with Thanatos, my kin? A perfect choice of mate; though I confess I'd not expected Death to have affection for another save himself.
AresRunProgress01|Ares Run Progress 01|Ares|You traveled rather far down there since last we met, my kin. And that means you have dealt incalculable death. I must commend you thus.
AresRunProgress02|Ares Run Progress 02|Ares|*Ahh*, my kin! I sensed fresh bloodshed from you recently, the real kind! For you have slain the living near the surface, have you not? Mere vermin, yes, but good enough for me.
AresRunCleared01|Ares Run Cleared 01|Ares|Recently, there was a burst of violence on the surface, near to where you are, but higher up. 'Twas altogether odd, but must have forced you to return once more. No matter; time is on our side.
AresRunCleared02|Ares Run Cleared 02|Ares|I sense so much death at the gates of your father's realm, of late, my kin. Now, I know that seems perfectly ordinary on the face of it, except... there's something more. I wonder if *you *know the reason why...
AresRunCleared03|Ares Run Cleared 03|Ares|I know your efforts to come here have repeatedly been thwarted, my good kin. However, we have caused such violence in the intervening time, that we must take this as a real victory. Let us continue for however long it takes.
AresAboutWar01|Ares About War 01|Ares|Surely you've heard rumblings about a war which has erupted on the surface, here? Doubtless you've seen an influx of fallen mortals. It's quite a decent one, I have to say! Though, unlikely to rise to the ranks of the greats. Too few armies involved in it, I fear.
AresAboutWar02|Ares About War 02|Ares|War's such a wondrous thing, my kin. It solves so many different problems, whilst perpetuating its own inevitability. Let's keep it up, then, hm?
AresAboutWar03|Ares About War 03|Ares|Do you ever think to yourself that you were born a bit too late, my kin? For my part, I wish that I could have been there myself when my father and the others waged ferocious war against the Titans. Ah, it must have been a sight!
AresAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Ares About Weapon Enchantments 01|Ares|I sense that you have forged a greater bond with your instruments of destruction there, my kin. Then that is very good. And may their altered forms serve you quite well.
AresAboutGuanYuAspect|Ares About Guan Yu Aspect|Ares|Why, I believe that is the Frost Fair Blade you bear! I understand it shall become the instrument of choice of yet another god of war, someday. I long to meet him, this fellow student of death.
AresAboutArthurAspect|Ares About Arthur Aspect|Ares|Ah, that blade of yours... it looks as though it could relieve a mortal of his head with ease. Excalibur, is it? I've studied all the Fates' designs, and this one is among my favorites.
AresAboutRamaAspect01|Ares About Rama Aspect 01|Ares|The fated bow Sharanga, in your grasp! That is not a form I'd expected you to wield. You have exquisite taste in weaponry, my kin!
AresAboutBeowulfAspect01|Ares About Beowulf Aspect 01|Ares|Is that the fire-eating shield of the great warrior Beowulf, which you have there? I knew the Fates had plans for it, but I did not expect for you to be a part!
AresAboutGilgameshAspect01|Ares About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Ares|Those are the gauntlets of the fated king Gilgamesh, are they not? A bringer of destruction, and an agent of the Fates. You are full of surprises, my kin!
AresAboutLuciferAspect01|Ares About Lucifer Aspect 01|Ares|You bear the warring instrument of one called Lucifer, I see. I've little to go on about him, but it is clear he knows a thing or two about destruction, is it not?
AresAboutKeepsake01|Ares About Keepsake 01|Ares|Ah, you bear the Blood-filled Vial which I granted you! The mortal's blood contained therein... I drew it myself! Too seldom am I able to become directly involved in such matters.
AresBackstory01|Ares Backstory 01|Ares|Know that I admire your Lord Father very much. For his grim work lets me continue mine. I trust that one day you shall settle your dispute.
AresPostFlashback01|Ares Post Flashback 01|Ares|You are the son of Night herself, they say? A fascinating character, ill-liked upon Olympus, although I myself have always longed to meet her.
AresPostGiftPickup01|Ares Post Gift Pickup 01|Ares|Ah, my favorite Underworld death-dealer. I so look forward to the pain you shall inflict this time around.
AresPostGiftPickup02|Ares Post Gift Pickup 02|Ares|Would that a sudden scourge of war would help you out of your predicament. Why, I would stir one up for you without a second thought.
AresPostGiftPickup03|Ares Post Gift Pickup 03|Ares|Ah, my closest kin in all the Underworld, I see you there, I think! What sort of violence shall we sow together this time, you and I?
AresPostGiftPickup04|Ares Post Gift Pickup 04|Ares|There's so much insufferable talk of peace up here, my kin. It is quite the relief to focus on much more important things, with you.
AresPostGiftPickup05|Ares Post Gift Pickup 05|Ares|You must know I often hunger for destruction, almost uncontrollably at that. Though I am finding you are able to sate that appetite of mine.
AresPostGiftPickup06|Ares Post Gift Pickup 06|Ares|May all the death you bring become the stuff of legends told in fearful mortal whisperings around the world, my kin.
AresAboutNyxIntro01|Ares About Nyx Intro 01|Ares|Would that I knew the goddess Nyx, myself, my kin! So many of my wars are waged by night. I am most grateful, and I wish her well.
AresAboutNyx01|Ares About Nyx 01|Ares|How is your mother Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.
AresAboutNyx01_B|Ares About Nyx 01 B|Ares|How is Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.
AresAboutNyx02|Ares About Nyx 02|Ares|Do tell your mother Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here, although we haven't met. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.
AresAboutNyx02_B|Ares About Nyx 02 B|Ares|Do tell Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.
AresAboutNyx03|Ares About Nyx 03|Ares|Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and your dark mother, Nyx, some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.
AresAboutNyx03_B|Ares About Nyx 03 B|Ares|Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and the goddess Nyx some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.
AresAboutNyx04|Ares About Nyx 04|Ares|Your mother Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?
AresAboutNyx04_B|Ares About Nyx 04 B|Ares|The goddess Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?
AresAboutNyx05|Ares About Nyx 05|Ares|You shall be pleased to hear that your own mother Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.
AresAboutNyx05_B|Ares About Nyx 05 B|Ares|You shall be pleased to hear that Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.
AresAboutNyx06|Ares About Nyx 06|Ares|Please send your mother Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.
AresAboutNyx06_B|Ares About Nyx 06 B|Ares|Please send the goddess Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.
AresPostEpilogue02|Ares Post Epilogue 02|Ares|You know, my kin, I had misunderstood that Nyx was your mother. But, Persephone? I never took her for the sort to have an interest in your realm. Alas that we never had opportunity to discuss the subject here.
AresPostEpilogue03|Ares Post Epilogue 03|Ares|Your good mother, Persephone... dread Queen of the Underworld! I certainly misjudged her when we had occasion to interact whilst she resided on Olympus. Perhaps I, too, should consider a life there in your realm...
AresHasWeapon01|Ares Has Weapon 01|Ares|You bear Varatha, the Eternal Spear...! I thought it lost! Have you any idea how many lives it drank during your father's glory days?
AresHasWeapon02|Ares Has Weapon 02|Ares|Ah, you wield Coronacht, the Heart-Seeker. It pierced three Titans in one shot back in the war amongst our kind. Please do take care of it!
AresHasWeapon03|Ares Has Weapon 03|Ares|You have the Shield of Chaos, Aegis... quite unlike the one my good sister Athena likes to flash around. You have much better taste.
AresHasWeapon04|Ares Has Weapon 04|Ares|Why, you are wielding Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! A most fascinating device. Imagine the new face of war, should its secrets someday be revealed, and spread to mortalkind!
AresHasWeapon05|Ares Has Weapon 05|Ares|Well if it isn't Malphon, the Twin Fists, bound to your very capable hands! So many weapons are so indirect, I think. With Malphon, you are about as close to the destruction as can be.
AresLegendaryPickUp01|Ares Legendary Pick Up 01|Ares|The greatest wars require great alliances, my kin. And so, I shall entrust to you some of the greatest methods of destruction I've devised thus far.
AresLegendaryPickUp02|Ares Legendary Pick Up 02|Ares|The winds of war blow fiercely on the surface now, my kin. Thus I am able to confer upon you even greater power than has been my custom.
AresLowHealth01|Ares Low Health 01|Ares|You seem to be upon the verge of death, my kin. I cannot wait to hear of it! The experience of death, time after time! You are one of a kind!
AresLowHealth02|Ares Low Health 02|Ares|Ah, my kin, but you have suffered terribly to come this far. No matter, for we soon shall pay your enemies in kind.
AresLowHealth03|Ares Low Health 03|Ares|So much letting of blood, so much of it, your own. Let's see to keeping you alive and in the fight a while longer, then.
AresLowHealth04|Ares Low Health 04|Ares|You're on the verge of yet another brush with death, I see, my hell-born kin. Do send some others down with you, would you?
AresLowHealth05|Ares Low Health 05|Ares|A mortal surely would have already succumbed to injuries such as the ones you've suffered, there. Impressive how you carry on, like that.
AresFirstPickUp|Ares First Pick Up|Zagreus|This one was bound to show up I guess. In the name of Hades! Olympus! I accept this message.
AresFirstPickUp|Ares First Pick Up|Ares|You've got quite the fighting spirit in you there, I have to say. Most intriguing, and yet no surprise for someone born in hell itself. You come on out of there, and tell me all about it. I'm a fellow student of death, you see.
AresMiscPickup01|Ares Misc Pickup 01|Ares|I must say you deal death rather exquisitely. Though, perhaps I could be of some further assistance in such matters, yes?
AresMiscPickup02|Ares Misc Pickup 02|Ares|*Ah*! I figured that you must have been the source of all that bloodshed underneath the earth. Let me see if I can make your death-dealing a little more efficient.
AresMiscPickup03|Ares Misc Pickup 03|Ares|Well, my hell-born kin, my blessing now is yours to do with as you wish; provided you inflict a little suffering for me?
AresMiscPickup04|Ares Misc Pickup 04|Ares|I've just the thing for you this time, my kin. May I present my instruments of pain?
AresMiscPickup05|Ares Misc Pickup 05|Ares|I surely hope your bloodshed's going well, and long that there shall be no end to it. I am, as ever, here to serve your benefit.
AresMiscPickup06|Ares Misc Pickup 06|Ares|How fares your endless war against the dead? Let it be known that I am happy to take sides in such affairs. Please, I insist!
AresMiscPickup07|Ares Misc Pickup 07|Ares|Death rears its head in all too many forms, I'm sure you know. Though you may never find them all, I nonetheless encourage you to try.
AresMiscPickup08|Ares Misc Pickup 08|Ares|The wretched dead you face perhaps forget themselves. Go, then, remind them of the agony which brought them to your realm.
AresMiscPickup09|Ares Misc Pickup 09|Ares|Life and death are inextricable, and war is often what connects the two. Don't you agree?
AresMiscPickup10|Ares Misc Pickup 10|Ares|This world has a limitless capacity for pain; and so, it truly is no inconvenience to help you to bring out a little more.
AresMiscPickup11|Ares Misc Pickup 11|Ares|The living and the dead alike desire what I represent. Their appetite for bloodshed cannot easily be sated. A goal to strive for, no?
AresMiscPickup12|Ares Misc Pickup 12|Ares|Perhaps the dead you stand against have long forgotten the experience of anguish and despair. I trust that you shall soon remind them for me?
AresMiscPickup13|Ares Misc Pickup 13|Ares|Beautiful, isn't it? The strife which follows you. You have a real knack for this, and I for one am happy to assist.
AresMiscPickup14|Ares Misc Pickup 14|Ares|Some would question the destruction which you sow, but I shall never do so. I fully understand your impulses. Allow me to indulge them.
AresMiscPickup15|Ares Misc Pickup 15|Ares|Not once has your Lord Father thanked me for delivering vast portions of his clientele. Surely you shall be more grateful for my gifts.
AresMiscPickup16|Ares Misc Pickup 16|Ares|Do you suppose the dead feel pain unlike the living? This is for me an endless fascination, so go on, and give me more to think about.
AresMiscPickup17|Ares Misc Pickup 17|Ares|As you continue waging war against the dead, I gladly lend you my support; family to family, no questions asked.
AresMiscPickup18|Ares Misc Pickup 18|Ares|It is a veritable crime your father distances himself from all the rest of us. It is fortunate that you yourself are not so disagreeable.
AresMiscPickup19|Ares Misc Pickup 19|Ares|Let us together deal some death, shall we?
AresMiscPickup20|Ares Misc Pickup 20|Ares|Shall we continue our campaign against the dead?
AresMiscPickup21|Ares Misc Pickup 21|Ares|What do you say we bring the dead some pain, for old time's sake?
AresMiscPickup22|Ares Misc Pickup 22|Ares|The devastation you have caused has not escaped my notice!
AresMiscPickup23|Ares Misc Pickup 23|Ares|We stand before a golden opportunity, to inflict pain. Let us proceed!
AresMiscPickup24|Ares Misc Pickup 24|Ares|There is no problem war cannot sort out.
AresMiscPickup25|Ares Misc Pickup 25|Ares|Ah there you are, my kin! I have a gift to aid your bloody work.
AresMiscPickup26|Ares Misc Pickup 26|Ares|My blessing be with you, and may death follow in your wake.
AresMiscPickup27|Ares Misc Pickup 27|Ares|Please spread some suffering down there for me, my kin.
AresMiscPickup28|Ares Misc Pickup 28|Ares|I shall empower you to acts of greater violence than before.
AresMiscPickup29|Ares Misc Pickup 29|Ares|War needn't carry out solely above the earth, my kin.
AresMiscPickup30|Ares Misc Pickup 30|Ares|I trust that the destruction which you sow is going well?
AresMiscPickup31|Ares Misc Pickup 31|Ares|The recent devastation which you caused, that was impressive work.
AresMiscPickup32|Ares Misc Pickup 32|Ares|Whenever you bring death, why, you've my full support.
AresMiscPickup33|Ares Misc Pickup 33|Ares|How fares the ceaseless slaying of your foes, quite well, my kin?
AresMiscPickup34|Ares Misc Pickup 34|Ares|Perhaps my blessing shall let you deliver death still more efficiently.
AresMiscPickup35|Ares Misc Pickup 35|Ares|Your father's realm shall be quite full, I think, once you and I are through.
AresMiscPickup36|Ares Misc Pickup 36|Ares|The finest instruments of death at my disposal shall be yours.
AresMiscPickup37|Ares Misc Pickup 37|Ares|I'd like to offer you a choice amongst my most exquisite tools which inflict suffering.
AresMiscPickup38|Ares Misc Pickup 38|Ares|What say we start our next war with a special flair, my kin?
AresMiscPickup39|Ares Misc Pickup 39|Ares|I've not seen ample blood spilled recently, so let's please make up for lost time.
AresMiscPickupExtra01|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 01|Ares|There are so many types of death... and yet, the sudden, violent kind is unsurpassed, I think.
AresMiscPickupExtra02|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 02|Ares|I am quite eager to commence jointly killing your enemies, my kin.
AresMiscPickupExtra03|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 03|Ares|What do you say we start another of our famous killing sprees, my kin?
AresMiscPickupExtra04|Ares Misc Pickup Extra 04|Ares|It's not been long since last I saw bloodshed... but far too long for me, nevertheless.
AresMiscPickupRareExtra01|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 01|Ares|My finest implements of death I now avail to you, my worthy kin.
AresMiscPickupRareExtra02|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 02|Ares|Let us make this blood-letting truly one to remember, then, hm?
AresMiscPickupRareExtra03|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 03|Ares|May you sow such destruction as to shake this mountain to its core, my kin.
AresMiscPickupRareExtra04|Ares Misc Pickup Rare Extra 04|Ares|I shall now give to you the means to wreak such havoc there, my kin!
AresMiscPickupAboutNyx01|Ares Misc Pickup About Nyx 01|Ares|I was quite pleased to hear again from Nyx of late, my kin.
AresMiscPickupAboutNyx02|Ares Misc Pickup About Nyx 02|Ares|May the wondrous goddess Nyx continue to watch over you, and darken the eyes of your foes.
AresMiscPickupAboutNyx03|Ares Misc Pickup About Nyx 03|Ares|To think you have the goddess Nyx's aid, as well as mine!
AresLootBought01|Ares Loot Bought 01|Ares|I knew that foul boatman would come through, and you would find amongst his wares this gift!
AresLootBought02|Ares Loot Bought 02|Ares|I give to you this token of respect, buried though it must have been within the boatman's hoard.
AresLootBought03|Ares Loot Bought 03|Ares|I trust the river-boatman Charon has been keeping plenty busy lately thanks to me?
AresLootBought04|Ares Loot Bought 04|Ares|The boatman Charon ought invest into a boat of more substantial size if he's to keep up with my work, my kin.
AresLootBought05|Ares Loot Bought 05|Ares|Your boatman there is a reliable deliverer of death, it seems. And that makes three of us, I think.
AresRejection01|Ares Rejection 01|Ares|You reject my generous offering of aid? *Hahahaha*, you must not know me very well. Death shall come, regardless, either to your enemies, or you.
AresRejection02|Ares Rejection 02|Ares|You would deny such aid as I would offer you? How rather disappointing. You've more to learn about the art of dealing death, it seems.
AresRejection03|Ares Rejection 03|Ares|An incorrect decision, there, my kin, to side against me thus. Blood needs be shed, and yours is going to suffice.
AresRejection04|Ares Rejection 04|Ares|It seems unwise of you to thus dismiss my offering. Suffer, then, a while by my hand.
AresRejection05|Ares Rejection 05|Ares|Your choice leaves much to be desired here, my kin. My temper I shall keep in check, but only barely so.
AresRejection06|Ares Rejection 06|Ares|A disappointing choice, my kin, and there are consequences to such choices, every single time.
AresRejection07|Ares Rejection 07|Ares|Your course of action here was ill-advised, my kin. For war shall come to you no matter what, as I shall presently reveal.
AresRejection08|Ares Rejection 08|Ares|The whims of our kind are unpredictable, my kin. But you shall find responses to such acts to be the definition of consistency.
AresRejection09|Ares Rejection 09|Ares|I'll not abide such disregard of our past companionship, my kin. In war, one must take sides, and you had best choose mine.
AresRejection10|Ares Rejection 10|Ares|War shall be waged here, no matter what, my kin. But even still, I am dismayed you would have sided against me.
AresRejection11|Ares Rejection 11|Ares|You wish to have a taste of what a war against me would be like? Well, then, I shall oblige.
AresRejection12|Ares Rejection 12|Ares|Did I detect some hesitancy on your part just then? Perhaps you knew that you were making a mistake. No matter; you'll learn now.
AresRejection13|Ares Rejection 13|Ares|You shall not goad me into anger with a petty insult such as this, you know. Nevertheless, there is a price which must be paid for it.
AresMakeUp01|Ares Make Up 01|Ares|A sacrifice in blood is fully paid, and we are squared away. Though think you twice next time before you cross me, hm?
AresMakeUp02|Ares Make Up 02|Ares|Well haven't you withstood my murderous intent! Resilience as this deserves reward, and I am feeling rather generous.
AresMakeUp03|Ares Make Up 03|Ares|It is not often I attempt to kill someone and they survive. Bravo! Our score is settled up for now, so let us carry on as friends.
AresMakeUp04|Ares Make Up 04|Ares|You capably survived my wrath, and I commend you for it. Let us continue on, as friends and kin.
AresMakeUp05|Ares Make Up 05|Ares|I think that we are squared away, for now. Though, do not test my patience further, hm?
AresMakeUp06|Ares Make Up 06|Ares|You crossed the fields of death impressively back there. Though, you are fortunate I'm in a giving mood.
AresMakeUp07|Ares Make Up 07|Ares|When blood is spilled and death is dealt, I simply cannot remain discontented for too long.
AresMakeUp08|Ares Make Up 08|Ares|What I could see of that display of violence you just sowed was thoroughly commendable, my kin. Then, here.
AresMakeUp09|Ares Make Up 09|Ares|Your sacrifice to me just now has moved me to forgiveness for the time; thus shall we call a truce.
AresMakeUp10|Ares Make Up 10|Ares|A war can only last so long, my kin. This one is not worth the pursuit, I think, when we can wage a greater one, together.
AresMakeUp11|Ares Make Up 11|Ares|Ah, after a show of violence such as that, how can I possibly remain upset, my kin?
AresMakeUp12|Ares Make Up 12|Ares|Your slight against me is already forgotten; for I was more than pleased to witness such a monstrous show of force.
AresGift01|Ares Gift 01|Zagreus|Lord Ares, please accept this offering, for giving me such strength as necessary to succeed.
AresGift01|Ares Gift 01|Ares|You are a flatterer, my death-inflicting kin. And I am feeling generous, as well, so here! A small token for you of my affection.
AresGift02|Ares Gift 02|Zagreus|Lord Ares, I honor you for all the strength you've given me to overcome my foes.
AresGift02|Ares Gift 02|Ares|Such a splendid offering, to me! How very thoughtful, there, my kin. I am taken aback, though I accept!
AresGift03|Ares Gift 03|Zagreus|Lord Ares! Please accept this token of my deep appreciation for your generous support.
AresGift03|Ares Gift 03|Ares|An offering, for me? Indeed! How gracious that you keep me in your thoughts. Know that, likewise, I keep you in mine.
AresGift04|Ares Gift 04|Zagreus|Lord Ares, it is my privilege to have met you, and have learned your death-inflicting way.
AresGift04|Ares Gift 04|Ares|I do appreciate this gift to me, although you really shouldn't have! The suffering which you inflict is ample compensation in itself.
AresGift05|Ares Gift 05|Zagreus|You have shown me nothing but respect and granted me your favor repeatedly, Lord Ares. This is the least that I can do, in kind.
AresGift05|Ares Gift 05|Ares|Most often when I'm given offerings, it is with wishes that I lend my favor in a coming war. Yet from you, my kin, I sense no such motive. I'm quite taken aback by that, I must admit.
AresGift06|Ares Gift 06|Zagreus|Lord Ares! As bloodshed has become somewhat of a necessity in my situation, I am very grateful that you're with me in this. I know never to take it for granted.
AresGift06|Ares Gift 06|Ares|You're most gracious with me, my kin; and I remain enthralled as ever by your blood-soaked way of life. I trust the violence I have wrought on your behalf has been quite satisfactory?
AresGift07|Ares Gift 07|Zagreus|I offer this Ambrosia in your name and honor, Lord Ares. To the god of war! How many foes have I vanquished with your aid and guidance? But more than that, I'm pleased to know you, and to be your cousin.
AresGift07|Ares Gift 07|Ares|Ah, such an exquisite gift this is, indeed. Yet, the destruction you have sown, the sheer carnage... nothing can surpass that, I should think. Should you ever go to war, my kin... genuinely go to war, I mean... do look me up. I imagine I would take your side.
ArtemisWithZeus01|Duo - Artemis and Zeus (1)|Artemis|*Tsk*, *um*, Zagreus... rather than greet you as I normally would do, instead, allow me to present you my illustrious, kind, generous lord father, your greatest Uncle Zeus!
ArtemisWithZeus01|Duo - Artemis and Zeus (1)|Zeus|*Erm*, thank you for the introduction, Daughter! Now, you run along, go frolic with your nymphs, or something! Leave me to assist my nephew, here. Bestow on him your faint blessing, if you must.
ArtemisWithPoseidon01|Duo - Artemis and Poseidon (1)|Artemis|You know my father and my uncle, by now, right, Zagreus? I don't know which of them is worse. *Uh*, I mean... superior! Superior, despite technically spending most of his time in the seas, beneath Olympus, isn't that right, Uncle?
ArtemisWithPoseidon01|Duo - Artemis and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|Oh, Artemis, you needn't boast to little Hades there on my account! Besides! Whether you're in the sea, above it, or beneath, makes little difference to your measure as a god! You two are young as yet! Keep at it, and you'll soon be practically as great as I!
ArtemisWithAphrodite01|Duo - Artemis and Aphrodite (1)|Artemis|Hey, *uh*, Zagreus! There's something I've been wondering, and don't take this the wrong way or anything, OK? Oh, no. It's her.
ArtemisWithAphrodite01|Duo - Artemis and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|Why, Artemis, you're absolutely tongue-tied! Due to our little godling in the Underworld, or a little due to me? *Hm-hm*, you shall figure it all out I'm sure!
ArtemisWithAphrodite01|Duo - Artemis and Aphrodite (1)|Artemis|Look, what was I, *ugh*, just, never mind. I'll talk to you some other time, I guess.
ArtemisWithAphrodite02|Duo - Artemis and Aphrodite (2)|Artemis|*Erm*, Zagreus, despite my hunter's instincts here, it seems I was unable to elude Aphrodite in this particular case, who insisted that we present ourselves to you at the same time, for whatever reason...
ArtemisWithAphrodite02|Duo - Artemis and Aphrodite (2)|Aphrodite|Oh, come now, Artemis! I'm sure you're very capable of hiding from a common beast, but I can see you plain. Why not be honest with yourself, next time?
ArtemisWithAres01|Duo - Artemis and Ares (1)|Artemis|Zagreus, I wish we all could hear you so that good Lord Ares here might be persuaded that my powers are entirely for different purposes than his!
ArtemisWithAres01|Duo - Artemis and Ares (1)|Ares|Perhaps our skillsets once were meant for different purposes, dear Artemis; but who are we to doubt the end result? Observe what shall transpire once we grant our kin our combined might.
ArtemisWithAres02|Duo - Artemis and Ares (2)|Artemis|Zagreus, I was just hoping for a little privacy before this hunt, which is consistently my preference here, except, you see, Lord Ares always seems to come sniffing about, first sign of any hunting instruments!
ArtemisWithAres02|Duo - Artemis and Ares (2)|Ares|Why, my dear Artemis, the hunt is but a prelude to a war, is that not so? For if all mortalkind knew naught of hunting, why, they would not be nearly so adept at killing one another.
ArtemisWithAres02|Duo - Artemis and Ares (2)|Artemis|Look, Lord Ares, if I lend you better marksmanship ability, you think that you could bother someone else?
ArtemisWithDionysus01|Duo - Artemis and Dionysus (1)|Artemis|Oh, great, it's you, Zagreus! Here, let me offer you some fine new Boons, as well as Lord Dionysus here, who I am sure would love to talk your ear off just as much as mine!
ArtemisWithDionysus01|Duo - Artemis and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|*Eh*, tells me I'm being awful loud, and to back off, all sorts of nasty stuff like that, what can you do, though, right?
ArtemisWithDemeter01|Duo - Artemis and Demeter (1)|Artemis|Oh, hi there, Zagreus, I was just failing to persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up off the snowy stretch that we've been having for a while. Some of the mortals are quite weary of it now, and it sure doesn't make the hunting any easier!
ArtemisWithDemeter01|Duo - Artemis and Demeter (1)|Demeter|The mortals are resourceful, Artemis. Their one redeeming quality, perhaps! They'll find a way through our long winter here. They ought to, since they brought it on themselves.
ArtemisAboutRamaAspect01|Artemis About Rama Aspect 01|Artemis|Um, Zagreus, did you attempt to chat with Coronacht just yet? Remember, tell the bow *I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! *Something good's supposed to happen if you do, some divine archer-person's aspect I should think? You going to try it soon, or not?
ArtemisAboutRamaAspect02|Artemis About Rama Aspect 02|Artemis|Hey, look at that! The message must have worked! Practically can see that shiny bow from here! I've never wielded Coronacht myself, at least not yet. Though if the Fates are sending visions to me of its past or future bearers, why, I guess I'm bound to get my shot eventually!
ArtemisAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Artemis About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Found you, Huntress, here. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Especially for you, Lady Artemis!
ArtemisAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Artemis About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Artemis|Some kind of special message for me...! Oh, looks like there's one for everybody on Olympus, then. Felt rather special for a moment, there! And now you're making me check in with all the others. Great!
ArtemisPostEpilogue01|Artemis Post Epilogue 01|Artemis|Have to say, I had a pretty decent time with everybody at our little visit recently! Met you, Uncle Hades, even great Achilles! Still don't quite appreciate you tricking us, but *eh*! I can get over it eventually. Anyway, you still could use assistance from me, right?
ArtemisAboutZeus01|Artemis About Zeus 01|Artemis|Ah, good old Father Zeus, he must have blessed you with his lightning bolts, did he? Always looking out for everyone.
ArtemisAboutPoseidon01|Artemis About Poseidon 01|Artemis|Uncle Poseidon blessed you, didn't he. To think that big, fat oaf is your own father's brother. I'm told to be respectful near him, but it's hard.
ArtemisAboutAthena01|Artemis About Athena 01|Artemis|You met Athena earlier, I guess? I'd never trade my bow for all that pomp and armor, but... I guess to each her own.
ArtemisAboutAres01|Artemis About Ares 01|Artemis|You're pretty close with Ares, aren't you? And here they said it couldn't be done. If I were you I'd watch myself with him.
ArtemisAboutAphrodite01|Artemis About Aphrodite 01|Artemis|So Aphrodite reached you first, did she? Sounds exactly like something she'd do. She has a knack for trouble. So, let's just stay focused, here!
ArtemisAboutDionysus01|Artemis About Dionysus 01|Artemis|That lush and lecher, Dionysus, counts you as a friend? I'm hoping that there must be some mistake, yeah, Zagreus?
ArtemisAboutHermes01|Artemis About Hermes 01|Artemis|You seem particularly light on your feet, there, Zagreus. I'd figure Hermes, himself, was speeding you along, except I've not seen him about in... been a while, really.
ArtemisAboutDemeter01|Artemis About Demeter 01|Artemis|So even Demeter's become involved in this! Didn't think she would. Though you'll be glad she did! Provided you stay on her warm and fuzzy side, of course. Working on that, myself!
ArtemisBackstory01|Artemis Backstory 01|Artemis|Something's troubled me a little, about you. You fight so desperately. At first I thought you simply lacked in patience. But now I see it's urgency that drives you. What is it that you're after, really...?
ArtemisRunProgress01|Artemis Run Progress 01|Artemis|Let's see. You blundered headlong into danger for the past six chambers or more. And you made such a racket I could almost hear it from Olympus. I have to say, your hunting skills are rather unconventional.
ArtemisRunProgress02|Artemis Run Progress 02|Artemis|I'm with you every step till you arrive here, Zagreus. Then I will probably ignore you like the rest. Just warning you ahead of time, all right?
ArtemisAboutVermin01|Artemis About Vermin 01|Artemis|Say, were you hunting vermin near the surface lately, Zagreus? That's practically just like the real thing! It must have been a thrill!
ArtemisAboutVermin02|Artemis About Vermin 02|Artemis|You've become a right accomplished vermin hunter, Zagreus! Maybe you'll get to use those skills against worthier creatures soon enough.
ArtemisVsMeg01|Artemis Vs Meg 01|Artemis|That Fury down in Tartarus has been a real problem, hasn't she. I see the huntress instinct in her. She thinks she knows your weaknesses. Don't let yourself become predictable.
ArtemisVsAchilles01|Artemis Vs Achilles 01|Artemis|Hey, I once heard Lord Hades has in his employ the greatest hero of the Trojan War, you happen to know anything about that? I'm kind of a fan. You see Achilles, tell him he's the best for me!
ArtemisVsAchilles02|Artemis Vs Achilles 02|Artemis|So, I have heard that Achilles, himself, taught you how to fight! No wonder you can hold your own down there, that is amazing...! You be sure to honor him from time to time, got it?
ArtemisPostFlashback01|Artemis Post Flashback 01|Artemis|Living on Olympus here, I'm surrounded by my family, but I always felt alone. I know that's not the same as your experience, but, I'm just saying I relate to what you're going through.
ArtemisHighAffinity01|Artemis High Affinity 01|Artemis|I think you might enjoy it on Olympus, there's... a lot of feasting here, I guess, and the air is cool and crisp, and it's much brighter than it is down there. Sounds like a dream, right?
ArtemisHighAffinity02|Artemis High Affinity 02|Artemis|I hope that once you make it to Olympus we'll go hunting sometime, you and I, you know? I like being on my own and all, but it's been nice, talking to you like this.
ArtemisHighAffinity03|Artemis High Affinity 03|Artemis|I grow so tired of the others here, you know? Much rather be out with the woodland nymphs than with these gods upon this mountaintop. You must know what it's like.
ArtemisAboutCallisto01|Artemis About Callisto 01|Artemis|Not everybody on Olympus is a total disappointment, Zagreus. Why, someday maybe you could meet Callisto, she goes hunting with me all the time! Bet you don't see many woodland nymphs down there.
ArtemisAboutCallisto02|Artemis About Callisto 02|Artemis|Hey Zagreus, that Nectar you sent? Callisto and the nymphs and I, we popped it open recently, and it was really good! Had us positively frolicking about. So, thanks!
ArtemisAboutCallisto03|Artemis About Callisto 03|Artemis|You must have a friend or two, don't you? It's hard being alone all of the time. At least I have Callisto and the other nymphs, and... I have you! A distant friend is still a friend, isn't that right?
ArtemisAboutCallisto04|Artemis About Callisto 04|Artemis|Hope you don't mind, I told Callisto all about you recently! Don't worry, I was quite discreet about it, the two of us were on the hunt, not like I just shouted out your story from the mountaintops!
ArtemisAboutCallisto05|Artemis About Callisto 05|Artemis|Zagreus, if only you could turn yourself into a woodland creature and just fly or burrow out of there! My Callisto, she can turn into a bear, you ever seen those? Monstrous, furry things, quite huggable, if they don't kill you first!
ArtemisAboutCallisto06|Artemis About Callisto 06|Artemis|You've never even seen the woods, have you? I hope you do, someday. You could meet Callisto and the others! It's quite beautiful, and green, and calm, it's... anyway.
ArtemisAboutCallisto07|Artemis About Callisto 07|Artemis|Don't know what it is about you, Zagreus, but I feel like I can be me with you, you know? Maybe it's that you don't constantly talk over me like everybody else, besides Callisto and the nymphs I guess. Not that I can even hear you, but, you know what I mean, right?
ArtemisHasWeapon01|Artemis Has Weapon 01|Artemis|Hey, how'd you get your hands on a nice bow like that? You take good care of Coronacht for me, so I can try it too once you're up here.
ArtemisAboutBowWeaponProgress01|Artemis About Bow Weapon Progress 01|Artemis|Have to admit, you're very capable with Coronacht. Now I can hit a bull's eye in my sleep, but you'll be right there with me if I don't keep practicing I think!
ArtemisAboutSpearWeapon01|Artemis About Spear Weapon 01|Artemis|Hey, that's the Eternal Spear, Varatha, isn't it? Your father used to use that, didn't he. A bit ornate for hunting, but a spear's a spear, is what I like to say!
ArtemisAboutAchillesAspect01|Artemis About Achilles Aspect 01|Artemis|Hey, that can't possibly be the spear once wielded by the great Achilles, there, can it?! The shape is unmistakable, I mean, have you even the slightest just how many mortals got completely slaughtered by that thing? Oh, it has seen some use!
ArtemisAboutChironAspect01|Artemis About Chiron Aspect 01|Artemis|That's not the Coronacht I know, isn't that... Chiron the centaur's bow? So that was Coronacht, as well? Seems every decent bow was just a version of that thing! Except for mine, of course.
ArtemisAboutHeraAspect01|Artemis About Hera Aspect 01|Artemis|Say, that's the bow Stepmother Hera herself once wielded, isn't it? Her aspect of Coronacht! I'd know it from the... frankly rather sinister skulls all over it. It's very Hera, trust me.
ArtemisAboutFistWeapon01|Artemis About Fist Weapon 01|Artemis|When did you get your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists? Hands *in*, I ought to say! I heard that one time, Demeter, she smacked her father right square in the face with those! Bet you can probably relate.
ArtemisAboutGunWeapon01|Artemis About Gun Weapon 01|Artemis|Well, look at you, with Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! Seems much too noisy-complicated as a hunting weapon when you could just use a nice quiet bow, but hey, to each her own.
ArtemisRevealsRamaAspect01|Artemis Reveals Rama Aspect 01|Artemis|Now listen, Zagreus, admittedly this is a little strange, even from me. I have a message for your bow! That's right, just go on up to Coronacht next time, and tell it with a firm, commanding voice, *I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! *Let me know how it goes, OK?
ArtemisAboutKeepsake01|Artemis About Keepsake 01|Artemis|Hey, that's my Adamant Arrowhead on you! Normally, it's for killing things, but in your case it makes it even easier for me to hunt you down, even in the dark. Now that I found you... here!
ArtemisAboutZagreus01|Artemis About Zagreus 01|Artemis|Your name, it means *'great hunter'*, Zagreus! I guess your mother Nyx must have expected someday that you'd pick up a few pointers from myself!
ArtemisRunCleared01|Artemis Run Cleared 01|Artemis|Hey, hold a moment, Zagreus, I could have sworn... you were so close, before, but now you're back? Ah, must have tripped up just when victory was close at hand, it happens all the time. We'll get you out of there, you'll see!
ArtemisLowHealth01|Artemis Low Health 01|Artemis|Hey, you all right there, Zagreus? Wouldn't do to have you die on me just moments after meeting here like this.
ArtemisLowHealth02|Artemis Low Health 02|Artemis|*Oh*! Look at you, you're hurt there pretty bad, but, just stay focused on the hunt, and it'll help to keep the pain at bay.
ArtemisLowHealth03|Artemis Low Health 03|Artemis|Look, I'm just goddess of the hunt, not medicine, so... I don't know if this is going to help right now, but, here!
ArtemisLowHealth04|Artemis Low Health 04|Artemis|Your hunt has evidently not been going very well so far, I see. Though, maybe we can still turn it around.
ArtemisLowHealth05|Artemis Low Health 05|Artemis|Well, one good thing about all of the blood you've lost is it was even easier to track you down this time!
ArtemisLegendaryPickUp01|Artemis Legendary Pick Up 01|Artemis|All right, get ready for this, Zagreus, because I seldom share the greatest of my hunting secrets like I am about to.
ArtemisLegendaryPickUp02|Artemis Legendary Pick Up 02|Artemis|All right, no need to keep on toying with your prey. Here comes one of my finest blessings, *now*!
ArtemisLegendaryPickUp03|Artemis Legendary Pick Up 03|Artemis|I don't reveal my greatest hunting techniques for just anybody, Zagreus, so you better appreciate what you're about to get, and use it to go far!
ArtemisLegendaryPickUp04|Artemis Legendary Pick Up 04|Artemis|How about we not take any chances this time, Zagreus? So here, this is the best I've got. You better not waste it!
ArtemisFirstPickUp|Artemis First Pick Up|Zagreus|There's only one heavenly archer I know of. Well, several, really. Anyway! In the name of Hades! Olympus? I accept this message.
ArtemisFirstPickUp|Artemis First Pick Up|Artemis|I heard about you. Look, I'm not like all the others on Olympus. The power of the hunt helps keep me company, so... maybe it'll help you, too!
ArtemisMiscPickup01|Artemis Misc Pickup 01|Artemis|Hey. You're not alone. You're not alone down there, OK? Here, let me show you.
ArtemisMiscPickup03|Artemis Misc Pickup 03|Artemis|The dead must make a rather easy target, wouldn't you say? Let's see what you can do to them, given your choice of these.
ArtemisMiscPickup04|Artemis Misc Pickup 04|Artemis|You busy, Zagreus? Thought maybe I could interest you in some of these old hunting tricks of mine.
ArtemisMiscPickup05|Artemis Misc Pickup 05|Artemis|How fares the hunt this time around, OK? I bet it could be better, so, *erm*, here! Maybe this'll help.
ArtemisMiscPickup06|Artemis Misc Pickup 06|Artemis|Let's take a little hunting expedition, yeah? You'll do most of the work, but hey, I'll be with you in spirit!
ArtemisMiscPickup07|Artemis Misc Pickup 07|Artemis|Sorry you're still stuck down there. Sometimes I feel stuck myself, but, a good hunt always sets me straight.
ArtemisMiscPickup08|Artemis Misc Pickup 08|Artemis|When I am on the hunt, my mind is clear, and nothing stands between me and my target. Though, have a blessing just in case you can't relate!
ArtemisMiscPickup09|Artemis Misc Pickup 09|Artemis|I'd love to know about your life down there. I'll try and help you live through it this time so that way you can tell me?
ArtemisMiscPickup10|Artemis Misc Pickup 10|Artemis|The wretches whom you face down there have died already, sometimes more than once. Should make for easy targets, right?
ArtemisMiscPickup11|Artemis Misc Pickup 11|Artemis|I've never come across a target I couldn't take down. I expect the same of you, you hear me? Hopefully you hear me.
ArtemisMiscPickup12|Artemis Misc Pickup 12|Artemis|Good hunting, Zagreus! The sooner you get out of there the sooner you can save me from my insufferable relatives. Please?
ArtemisMiscPickup13|Artemis Misc Pickup 13|Artemis|Hey, Zagreus, good luck out there, this time. I'd tell you *'may your aim be true' *but I can guarantee it, actually.
ArtemisMiscPickup14|Artemis Misc Pickup 14|Artemis|The hunt requires utter concentration, so, I'll leave you to it, and... just watch your every move in silence over here...
ArtemisMiscPickup15|Artemis Misc Pickup 15|Artemis|You want to make it out of there, you... don't have to listen to a word I say, to be quite honest, but... my huntress blessings ought to help.
ArtemisMiscPickup16|Artemis Misc Pickup 16|Artemis|Well, Zagreus, you getting out of there this time, or am I going to have to keep on hunting by myself for the time being? Probably?
ArtemisMiscPickup17|Artemis Misc Pickup 17|Artemis|Looks to me like you could use a little help, so I'll just have a look in my big bag of blessings here, and, *oh*! Here's just the thing.
ArtemisMiscPickup18|Artemis Misc Pickup 18|Artemis|The hunt comes down to kill-or-be-killed. Except for us immortals, who have to live with our shame, which is worse?
ArtemisMiscPickup19|Artemis Misc Pickup 19|Artemis|Those wretched things harassing you throughout that Underworld just won't give up, will they? Well, just keep killing them, I guess!
ArtemisMiscPickup20|Artemis Misc Pickup 20|Artemis|Need a hunting partner, Zagreus? Not that I'm able to join you myself down there, or even hear you respond for that matter, but, anyway, here.
ArtemisMiscPickup21|Artemis Misc Pickup 21|Artemis|Zagreus, it's me! I'm here to join the hunt with you again. Let's show them what we can do.
ArtemisMiscPickup22|Artemis Misc Pickup 22|Artemis|Hello again, you ready for this hunt? Me, I've been looking forward since last time, so, let's get on with it.
ArtemisMiscPickup23|Artemis Misc Pickup 23|Artemis|Stay on your guard, tread lightly, and all that.
ArtemisMiscPickup24|Artemis Misc Pickup 24|Artemis|Keep a sharp eye out there, won't you?
ArtemisMiscPickup25|Artemis Misc Pickup 25|Artemis|Good hunting down there, Zagreus.
ArtemisMiscPickup26|Artemis Misc Pickup 26|Artemis|What are you hunting this time, I wonder.
ArtemisMiscPickup27|Artemis Misc Pickup 27|Artemis|I'll be looking out for you. If you don't mind of course.
ArtemisMiscPickup28|Artemis Misc Pickup 28|Artemis|Remember, Zagreus, kill-or-be-killed.
ArtemisMiscPickup29|Artemis Misc Pickup 29|Artemis|How about I join you for this hunt, OK?
ArtemisMiscPickup30|Artemis Misc Pickup 30|Artemis|Hey, you take care of yourself, all right?
ArtemisMiscPickup31|Artemis Misc Pickup 31|Artemis|Got you something I bet you could use.
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra01|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 01|Artemis|The finer points of hunting are not easy to communicate, though you're learning from experience, at least!
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra02|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 02|Artemis|My senses sure are going to be sharp if I keep trying to keep up with you like this in all that dark down there.
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra03|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 03|Artemis|A good, clean shot is all it takes, most of the time!
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra04|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 04|Artemis|You getting anywhere down there yet, Zagreus?
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra05|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 05|Artemis|What are you waiting for, let's get to hunting, then!
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra06|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 06|Artemis|Not much of a hunt when your prey knows exactly where you are, but it'll do!
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra07|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 07|Artemis|I hope your every strike cuts to the vital bits of all your prey, there, Zagreus.
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra08|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 08|Artemis|I brought some hunting gear for you to try, if you could give me your attention, Zagreus?
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra09|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 09|Artemis|All right, Zagreus, catch your breath, decide, and then what say we get you out of hell maybe?
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra10|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 10|Artemis|What are we hunting this time, Zagreus? Don't tell me wretched dead, again?
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra11|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 11|Artemis|You see how easily I tracked you down? Unless you went out of your way for me, that is?
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra12|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 12|Artemis|I have a Boon for you, here, Zagreus, though just be sure you don't embarrass me.
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra13|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 13|Artemis|Well, perfect timing, Zagreus, now stock up and head out.
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra14|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 14|Artemis|You want to make it out of there, my Boons are just about the only way to go.
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra15|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 15|Artemis|Don't you let your father or let *anybody *push you around, Zagreus.
ArtemisMiscPickupExtra16|Artemis Misc Pickup Extra 16|Artemis|Bet I can help you break out of your father's realm in no time, Zagreus!
ArtemisMiscPickupRare01|Artemis Misc Pickup Rare 01|Artemis|Decided I would pack you something extra for this hunt, if you can handle it!
ArtemisMiscPickupRare02|Artemis Misc Pickup Rare 02|Artemis|Enough toying around with our prey, there, Zagreus. What do you say we finish it, this time?
ArtemisMiscPickupRare03|Artemis Misc Pickup Rare 03|Artemis|I know it must be such a struggle for you, Zagreus, so here! In case this helps.
ArtemisMiscPickupRare04|Artemis Misc Pickup Rare 04|Artemis|A great hunter ought to have great tools, Zagreus, so here! Please allow me.
ArtemisMiscPickupRare05|Artemis Misc Pickup Rare 05|Artemis|Wish I could hunt with you myself, but here's the next best thing, all right?
ArtemisMiscPickupAboutCallisto01|Artemis Misc Pickup About Callisto 01|Artemis|You know how long it took Callisto to become a master of the hunt? I'm sure you can still learn a thing or two!
ArtemisMiscPickupAboutCallisto02|Artemis Misc Pickup About Callisto 02|Artemis|I was about to head out with Callisto for a hunt, though I can spare you a quick Boon, I guess!
ArtemisMiscPickupAboutCallisto03|Artemis Misc Pickup About Callisto 03|Artemis|I have to meet Callisto soon, but it won't take me but a moment here to get you on your way!
ArtemisMiscPickupAboutCallisto04|Artemis Misc Pickup About Callisto 04|Artemis|Someday perhaps you'll join me and Callisto for a hunt! But as for now...
ArtemisMiscPickupAboutCallisto05|Artemis Misc Pickup About Callisto 05|Artemis|Greetings to you from the forest! Callisto and the woodland nymphs say hi!
ArtemisMiscPickupAboutCallisto06|Artemis Misc Pickup About Callisto 06|Artemis|You'd make a real asset on the hunt, I think. Not that Callisto and I need assistance, though.
ArtemisLootBought01|Artemis Loot Bought 01|Artemis|You know, one thing I'll say for Charon there? He doesn't talk too much. And since neither do you, I'm letting you have this.
ArtemisLootBought02|Artemis Loot Bought 02|Artemis|I guess this means you must have paid the boatman's ransom here, and whatever price he charged you, it was worth it.
ArtemisLootBought03|Artemis Loot Bought 03|Artemis|Even there in your Underworld, it seems quality hunting gear doesn't come cheap, apparently!
ArtemisLootBought04|Artemis Loot Bought 04|Artemis|If you're quite done with shopping, Zagreus, what say we cut straight to the chase from here?
ArtemisLootBought05|Artemis Loot Bought 05|Artemis|You hunted down a real bargain there in Charon's shop, though how about we try a slightly bigger deal on for size right now?
ArtemisRejection01|Artemis Rejection 01|Artemis|Why would you side with...?! *Ugh*, why do I even bother with some lesser god!
ArtemisRejection02|Artemis Rejection 02|Artemis|I thought we had an understanding, Zagreus. But, this wouldn't be the first time I was wrong about someone.
ArtemisRejection03|Artemis Rejection 03|Artemis|*Huh*, so that's your choice! Maybe you're more like my relatives than I'd care to admit.
ArtemisRejection04|Artemis Rejection 04|Artemis|Good shot, there, Zagreus! I guess you got me. Now why don't you go take a shot at *this*.
ArtemisRejection05|Artemis Rejection 05|Artemis|Don't be messing with my feelings, Zagreus. My loyalty's hard-won, and quickly lost.
ArtemisRejection06|Artemis Rejection 06|Artemis|You really missed an easy shot, here, Zagreus. But I will not. You'll see.
ArtemisRejection07|Artemis Rejection 07|Artemis|Ah, good! Just when I had almost forgotten what an arrow to the back felt like!
ArtemisRejection08|Artemis Rejection 08|Artemis|Am I some kind of pushover to you, Zagreus? Is that what you think?
ArtemisRejection09|Artemis Rejection 09|Artemis|Oh, look, turns out it's time for target practice once again! Start running, Zagreus.
ArtemisRejection10|Artemis Rejection 10|Artemis|What made you think I'd stand for this, from you?
ArtemisRejection11|Artemis Rejection 11|Artemis|*Ah-hah*, I knew you'd pull this old maneuver, Zagreus. And I am ready for you, now.
ArtemisRejection12|Artemis Rejection 12|Artemis|You're getting quite predictable when you betray me like this, Zagreus! Start running, then.
ArtemisRejection13|Artemis Rejection 13|Artemis|Oh really, that's the way it's going to be? You Underworld gods are all alike!
ArtemisMakeUp01|Artemis Make Up 01|Artemis|Fine, I'm not angry anymore, not really anyway, but you just watch yourself with me, you got it?
ArtemisMakeUp02|Artemis Make Up 02|Artemis|Oh you're still there I see. Well then, all right, let's call it even for the moment and get on with this.
ArtemisMakeUp03|Artemis Make Up 03|Artemis|All right, all right, I'm going to forgive you now I guess, no need to beg, you just think twice next time OK?
ArtemisMakeUp04|Artemis Make Up 04|Artemis|Got to say you handled yourself pretty well back there. I can't stay mad after a show like that.
ArtemisMakeUp05|Artemis Make Up 05|Artemis|Good hunting just now, Zagreus. You passed my little test, so now we're good, just like it never happened.
ArtemisMakeUp06|Artemis Make Up 06|Artemis|So you survived, so what. Here, why not take a Boon, and then be off?
ArtemisMakeUp07|Artemis Make Up 07|Artemis|I will admit mistakes were made back there, so you just don't make them again, next time all right?
ArtemisMakeUp08|Artemis Make Up 08|Artemis|You know what, I decided not to kill you, Zagreus. No sport in cornered prey, so here, get on with it.
ArtemisMakeUp09|Artemis Make Up 09|Artemis|Good thing you're nowhere near our mountaintop or I'd have shot you for that stunt, myself.
ArtemisMakeUp10|Artemis Make Up 10|Artemis|Well, Zagreus, it turns out you need all the help that you can get, so here's a pity Boon for you!
ArtemisMakeUp11|Artemis Make Up 11|Artemis|I could keep hunting you until you're dead, but there's too little meat on you to make it worth my while.
ArtemisGift01|Artemis Gift 01|Zagreus|Lady Artemis, I hope that you'll accept this offering, for all your kindness and support.
ArtemisGift01|Artemis Gift 01|Artemis|Hey thank you for this, really. And, I've just the thing to offer in return. It's just a gift, OK?
ArtemisGift02|Artemis Gift 02|Zagreus|My lady Artemis! This is nothing, next to all your grace and favor.
ArtemisGift02|Artemis Gift 02|Artemis|Hey wait, this is an offering, for me? I, *oh*, that's very kind, though, let's get back to hunting, now, OK?
ArtemisGift03|Artemis Gift 03|Zagreus|Lady Artemis! I am indebted to you, for the strength and cunning you have given me.
ArtemisGift03|Artemis Gift 03|Artemis|Look, Zagreus, I don't know what to say, except for... thanks!
ArtemisGift04|Artemis Gift 04|Zagreus|My lady Artemis, your favor's been invaluable to me. No finer huntress ever walked the surface of the earth, or underneath.
ArtemisGift04|Artemis Gift 04|Artemis|You're being very nice to me, and that makes me suspicious, understand? So, you want more of that... you keep this up.
ArtemisGift05|Artemis Gift 05|Zagreus|At the risk of incurring your wrath, Lady Artemis, I hope you will accept this from me, and see that my gratitude for all you have done for me is genuine.
ArtemisGift05|Artemis Gift 05|Artemis|What do you know, another gift of Nectar, that's... quite thoughtful of you, Zagreus! Normally don't care much for the stuff, but, every now and then, I mean... why not?
ArtemisGift06|Artemis Gift 06|Zagreus|In your honor, Lady Artemis! Your mighty blessings have helped me through so many trials now, and I always welcome your level-headed presence here.
ArtemisGift06|Artemis Gift 06|Artemis|Look, I like being worshiped just as much as anybody, Zagreus, though bear in mind that you can always leave the worship of me to the forest nymphs, all right?
ArtemisGift07|Artemis Gift 07|Zagreus|I know you have no shortage of Ambrosia on Olympus, Lady Artemis, but I imagine it's less often that the stuff go all the way from there to here, and back. What can I say? You make me proud to be a member of this family.
ArtemisGift07|Artemis Gift 07|Artemis|I never felt like I could be myself with everybody on this mountaintop, you know? So much posturing, and bickering, and... I just head out to the woods most of the time. Maybe you understand me better than the rest, I've no idea still. But I appreciate you've made attempts to try.
AphroditeWithZeus01|Duo - Aphrodite and Zeus (1)|Aphrodite|Dearest, your lord uncle wishes to address you from our mountaintop, although I had assured him that the two of us, we had everything well under control!
AphroditeWithZeus01|Duo - Aphrodite and Zeus (1)|Zeus|Come now, Zagreus, the only thing Lady Aphrodite has under control is her long list of salivating suitors, am I right? Aphrodite, how about you bestow your blessing and be off, and I'll take it from here.
AphroditeWithPoseidon01|Duo - Aphrodite and Poseidon (1)|Aphrodite|The thing to know about this family, dearest, is that, each of us, we have our little quirks. Although, we always stick together and our love for one another perseveres!
AphroditeWithPoseidon01|Duo - Aphrodite and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|Oh, *hoh*! What do we have here, little Hades? Seems to me that you have *company*! Well, I'll just leave the two of you alone. My lips are sealed tighter than a warship hull!
AphroditeWithPoseidon01|Duo - Aphrodite and Poseidon (1)|Aphrodite|Oh, feel free to stay, Poseidon! I was just explaining what an idiot you are, though you're able to articulate this best! Anyway, dearest, what was I on about...?
AphroditeWithAthena01|Duo - Aphrodite and Athena (1)|Aphrodite|You must forgive us, little godling, meaning our extended family here upon Olympus! Some of us are terribly stuck up, and must be making matters much more complicated than they have to be.
AphroditeWithAthena01|Duo - Aphrodite and Athena (1)|Athena|I wonder, dearest Aphrodite, whether you'd be willing to repeat such things directly to my countenance?
AphroditeWithAthena01|Duo - Aphrodite and Athena (1)|Aphrodite|Oh, you must know full well that I would do much more than that directly to your countenance, Athena dear! Quite frankly, you could use a lot of work!
AphroditeWithAthena02|Duo - Aphrodite and Athena (2)|Aphrodite|Dearest, you must know, Goddess Athena and myself, we don't always share a common view, perhaps because she overthinks things constantly, while my heart leads me on!
AphroditeWithAthena02|Duo - Aphrodite and Athena (2)|Athena|I'm glad we understand each other, then. It would be most embarrassing to be caught bickering amongst ourselves in front of Zagreus.
AphroditeWithAres01|Duo - Aphrodite and Ares (1)|Aphrodite|I think for many of us, dearest, it can come as a surprise to learn that love and war often go hand in hand. Opposite forces, yet this connects them, doesn't it. The fiercest passions of gods and mortals! Isn't that right, Lord Ares?
AphroditeWithAres01|Duo - Aphrodite and Ares (1)|Ares|Mortals are so bent on clinging to their lives, that many among them would gladly kill for it. The surge of emotion which they feel... one passion is no different from another, Lady Aphrodite, dear.
AphroditeWithArtemis01|Duo - Aphrodite and Artemis (1)|Aphrodite|Oh dearest! I have brought you keen-eyed Artemis, who, in her focus on the hunt, has not developed social graces suitable enough to come to you herself!
AphroditeWithArtemis01|Duo - Aphrodite and Artemis (1)|Artemis|Social graces, she says! Going about like *that*! I'm sure you know that I can find you when it's necessary, Zagreus. Though, how to get away from Aphrodite, I have no idea.
AphroditeWithDionysus01|Duo - Aphrodite and Dionysus (1)|Aphrodite|My powers, dearest, oft go hand-in-hand with those of Dionysus, with his power to persuade the mind to find such beauty where it isn't, really!
AphroditeWithDionysus01|Duo - Aphrodite and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|*Ah, haha*, no need to flatter me like that, there, Lady Aphrodite! Beauty's almost entirely within the mind, I'm sure! And in the muscles and the jawline and the winning smile and, well, who am I to tell you, yeah?
AphroditeWithDemeter01|Duo - Aphrodite and Demeter (1)|Aphrodite|The venerable goddess of the seasons, Demeter, chooses to look as stately as can be, can you believe it, dearest? Although, why one would mark so many fine lines upon their face, I wouldn't know.
AphroditeWithDemeter01|Duo - Aphrodite and Demeter (1)|Demeter|Oh, Aphrodite, dear... you wouldn't know a thing of substance if it offered you a cloak. Your chosen countenance makes plain the full extent of your intentions, and your interests alike.
AphroditeAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Aphrodite About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|OK, I think I'm ready. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! And I hope it finds you well, Lady Aphrodite!
AphroditeAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Aphrodite About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Aphrodite|Why, *this *is something, dearest! Such an enigmatic message you have sent. How positively captivating; I must know what it says. It bears the marks of others on Olympus, so... perhaps we ought to share some common knowledge on the subject, hm?
AphroditePostEpilogue01|Aphrodite Post Epilogue 01|Aphrodite|Oh, dearest, you've no idea what a delightful time I had while visiting you recently! So many new sights and sounds and smells, why, it was wonderful! And you are burdened with a big responsibility, aren't you? Mind if I lend my graces to you still from time to time...?
AphroditeAboutZeus01|Aphrodite About Zeus 01|Aphrodite|Lord Zeus has made acquaintances with you? Oh I sometimes forget that he's your uncle! His favor's well worth having, I assure you.
AphroditeAboutPoseidon01|Aphrodite About Poseidon 01|Aphrodite|That oaf Poseidon spoke to you already, didn't he? All bluster, muscles, and bravado, that one. I'm glad you're not the type.
AphroditeAboutAthena01|Aphrodite About Athena 01|Aphrodite|You've met Athena, dearest, so you know not all the ladies on Olympus are alike. And I, for one, am grateful to our forebears for *that*!
AphroditeAboutAres01|Aphrodite About Ares 01|Aphrodite|I sense the mark of my Lord Ares on you, love. He's poorly understood among the gods, yet surely you can see fair qualities in him, and me?
AphroditeAboutArtemis01|Aphrodite About Artemis 01|Aphrodite|The sullen Artemis reached out to you, did she? Oh, that's adorable, dearest! Just don't make any sudden movements with her, *hm*?
AphroditeAboutDionysus01|Aphrodite About Dionysus 01|Aphrodite|You are so fortunate to have received the Boon of Dionysus prior to my own! He, the most noble and important of us all, the god of wine, himself!
AphroditeAboutDemeter01|Aphrodite About Demeter 01|Aphrodite|Why, did sorrowful old Demeter get all the way to you before I did? She stubbornly refuses me when I offer to help! Unlike you, little godling!
AphroditePostGiftPickup01|Aphrodite Post Gift Pickup 01|Aphrodite|How I *love *to have these unexpected little run-ins with you, love! You are just so spontaneous, and I've a liking for that sort of thing!
AphroditePostGiftPickup02|Aphrodite Post Gift Pickup 02|Aphrodite|Keep following that heart of yours, dearest! It's good enough a guide, believe you me. Mine tells me you are going to succeed!
AphroditePostGiftPickup04|Aphrodite Post Gift Pickup 04|Aphrodite|You *do *know that I'm married, don't you, love...? I'd forgive you if you didn't, for my husband, he's always... busy with his work. I'm grateful that you're there for me to talk to.
AphroditePostFlashback01|Aphrodite Post Flashback 01|Aphrodite|You're going to love it on Olympus, little godling. The air is beautiful and brisk, the gardens lush, the feasting plentiful...! Why, it must be the opposite of everything to which you are accustomed!
AphroditePostFlashback02|Aphrodite Post Flashback 02|Aphrodite|What shall we do here once you finally arrive? Perhaps we could go out and meet some *mortals*! I know all too many maidens and/or noble gentlemen who'd absolutely love to get to know you.
AphroditeVsAchilles01|Aphrodite Vs Achilles 01|Aphrodite|A little bird once told me that the shade of the great hero called Achilles now resides within your father's residence, dearest? I always wished to meet with him someday...
AphroditeVsAchilles02|Aphrodite Vs Achilles 02|Aphrodite|You met Achilles after all, godling. He was quite instrumental in a war of my design. Still, he resisted my attempts to sway his actions. You tell him, simply, I admire him.
AphroditeVsAchilles03|Aphrodite Vs Achilles 03|Aphrodite|The great hero Achilles, he continues to ignore my polite outreach, doesn't he? Why, I've attempted to reach out at least several times! Your father's realm is really quite a lot. How terribly frustrating it must be!
AphroditeVsMeg01|Aphrodite Vs Meg 01|Aphrodite|You've had a brush with Megaera, the Fury, haven't you? Oh I know a thing or two about that one. Though, lately we Olympians no longer mingle with those living in the Underworld. You're the only exception!
AphroditeVsMeg02|Aphrodite Vs Meg 02|Aphrodite|A little birdy told me recently that you and Megaera the Fury, why, you've grown quite close! Now *do *be careful around her, and, try not to get attached, there, *hm*?
AphroditeAboutKeepsake01|Aphrodite About Keepsake 01|Aphrodite|Why, you have my Eternal Rose, don't you? I am so very touched that you'd think first of me among my mighty kin. It pleases me to know I'm in your thoughts!
AphroditeRunCleared01|Aphrodite Run Cleared 01|Aphrodite|Oh what is going *on *down there, dearest? I thought for certain you would make it out, but seems that nasty place has kept you grounded, hasn't it. But don't despair, and you take heart, won't you?
AphroditeAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Aphrodite About Persephone Meeting 01|Aphrodite|Something has stirred within your heart, dearest! Oh, I can always tell! A certain kind of love, for family? Yes, that must be it, I think! What could have transpired with you, *hm*?
AphroditePostEpilogue02|Aphrodite Post Epilogue 02|Aphrodite|To think your father and that sweet Persephone, they were together down there, all along! I was so certain that your father's heart was cold. That's just the thing with love, dearest! That, sometimes, it surprises even me!
AphroditeHighAffinity01|Aphrodite High Affinity 01|Aphrodite|My dearest little godling, how fares everything with you of late? I love to have these little interactions with you, simple as they are, for they have brightened many of my evenings here.
AphroditeAboutLove01|Aphrodite About Love 01|Aphrodite|Little godling, you must know the seven types of love by now, don't you? It's quite a complicated field, though several types intrigue me most of all. In fact, why, I have several types of love for you, right here!
AphroditeAboutLove02|Aphrodite About Love 02|Aphrodite|Dearest, why... I sense your heart is very full, indeed! You positively emanate with love. You must have grown quite close to many dear to you. Perhaps so you may do the same with me...? I'm so delighted to have seen your spirit shine.
AphroditeAboutLove03|Aphrodite About Love 03|Aphrodite|Oh, my, dearest! I have to say, your heart is positively bursting with such love for so many you have come to care about! Your dearest friends, your burning passions, family, *everyone*! Why, you're like a living testament to my entire body of work!
AphroditeBackstory01|Aphrodite Backstory 01|Aphrodite|I cannot help but wonder, dearest, why Lord Hades would have kept your mere existence hidden from us all this time. Perhaps he knew that, once you met us, you would stop at nothing to come seek us out!
AphroditeAboutMegRelationship01|Aphrodite About Meg Relationship 01|Aphrodite|I sense you finally acted on your pent-up passion for the Fury Megaera, yes, little godling? These types of things, they don't escape my notice, and they're always so enjoyable to see!
AphroditeAboutMegRelationship02|Aphrodite About Meg Relationship 02|Aphrodite|How's fearsome Megaera the Fury treating you of late, *hmm*, dearest? I know her type so very well, indeed. She acts as though there's nothing that can get under her skin, isn't that right?
AphroditeAboutThanRelationship01|Aphrodite About Than Relationship 01|Aphrodite|*Mmm*, so my heart tells me that you've developed quite the bond with moody Thanatos, haven't you, there? I always figured that his brooding quality was just an act!
AphroditeAboutThanRelationship02|Aphrodite About Than Relationship 02|Aphrodite|Little godling, would that I knew every last detail of how you and Thanatos are getting on of late! The notorious incarnate of death, and the newly discovered son of Hades, fraternizing? It's positively scandalous I think!
AphroditeAboutDusaRelationship01|Aphrodite About Dusa Relationship 01|Aphrodite|*Erm*, dearest? If my perfectly developed senses are correct, then you appear to be quite smitten with a little gorgon that you've met down there...? Why that must be adorable, if rather strange!
AphroditeAboutDusaRelationship02|Aphrodite About Dusa Relationship 02|Aphrodite|Why, something's changed about the beating of your heart, dearest! *Oh*, it's the little gorgon, isn't it. You Underworld dwellers and your complicated feelings! I can never get enough. My blessings to the both of you, then, *hm*?
AphroditeLowHealth01|Aphrodite Low Health 01|Aphrodite|Oh, look at you, you poor, poor thing, you're hurt! Though, let me see if I can make it better.
AphroditeLowHealth02|Aphrodite Low Health 02|Aphrodite|*Tsk*, you're in no condition for an outing with me, dearest. Though, perhaps you might recover from your hardships with my aid?
AphroditeLowHealth03|Aphrodite Low Health 03|Aphrodite|Dearest, why, your heart rate's fluctuating wildly! Has it really been that bad up to this point? I'll try to help however much I can.
AphroditeLowHealth04|Aphrodite Low Health 04|Aphrodite|Oh, you're just in an awful situation, aren't you. Yet, I can tell your proud heart keeps on beating, for the moment anyway! Don't die just yet!
AphroditeLowHealth05|Aphrodite Low Health 05|Aphrodite|Ah, little godling, you're about to die! Why, none of us want *that*, because if so, you won't get to enjoy my blessings here!
AphroditeLegendaryPickUp01|Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 01|Aphrodite|I have been waiting for a special moment to confess my great appreciation for your deeds... this moment's special enough, isn't it?
AphroditeLegendaryPickUp02|Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 02|Aphrodite|My loveliest of blessings is reserved only for those who've earned my deepest adoration. So, congratulations, love! And here you go!
AphroditeLegendaryPickUp03|Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 03|Aphrodite|Sometimes, our hearts become so full that they could burst! If only you could see how much I care. I would do anything to aid you in your plight! My heartfelt blessings be with you, dearest.
AphroditeLegendaryPickUp04|Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 04|Aphrodite|Little godling, you must know that the heart has infinite capacity for empathy. And I so feel for you there, that I have mustered for you some of the most beautiful of blessings I can offer!
AphroditeFirstPickUp|Aphrodite First Pick Up|Zagreus|I must be a mess, let's see here. Hi there! In the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.
AphroditeFirstPickUp|Aphrodite First Pick Up|Aphrodite|Why hello, hello, there, little godling. I have to say you're quite the specimen, and so, I've decided I shall aid you for the moment. You interested?
AphroditeMiscPickup01|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 01|Aphrodite|Did you miss me, little godling, *hm*? I thought I'd steal away a bit and that together we might make up for lost time.
AphroditeMiscPickup02|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 02|Aphrodite|Hello again, there, little godling, let's get to it, *hm*? I want what you want; there's no further need for words.
AphroditeMiscPickup03|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 03|Aphrodite|Oh, boo, looks like you've rather got yourself into a bind, there, haven't you. Though, not to worry, dearest. I can pull some strings.
AphroditeMiscPickup04|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 04|Aphrodite|There, there, dearest, you'll tell me all your troubles just as soon as you arrive, so let's just get you out of there for now.
AphroditeMiscPickup05|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 05|Aphrodite|What is it, love, are you still having problems with the dead? I swear, you'd think they had enough of me in life!
AphroditeMiscPickup06|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 06|Aphrodite|What did I miss since last time, anything of interest, *hm*? You'll have to fill me in once you break free, dearest.
AphroditeMiscPickup07|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 07|Aphrodite|Well, look at you, there, love! So well-prepared to take on any danger that may come! But, I must wonder, are you well-prepared for *this*?
AphroditeMiscPickup08|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 08|Aphrodite|Ready yourself, dearest, because you and I? We're going to have ourselves a little outing I expect that neither one of us shall soon forget.
AphroditeMiscPickup09|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 09|Aphrodite|Would you by any chance have room, there, in your heart for a most-gentle blessing from a goddess such as me?
AphroditeMiscPickup10|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 10|Aphrodite|Don't lose heart, now, little godling! I won't have you giving up before you get to see me in the flesh among the gardens of Olympus here...!
AphroditeMiscPickup11|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 11|Aphrodite|Dearest, I've known many gods and godlings through the ages. And, I have to say, you're *quite *intriguing, even for our kind.
AphroditeMiscPickup12|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 12|Aphrodite|Oh, dearest, I suspect we'll have ourselves a most exciting time together, you and I! Just do your best and it'll all be fine!
AphroditeMiscPickup13|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 13|Aphrodite|I am always here, or close enough, to help you through whatever troubles you may face, my little godling. So do not hesitate to call upon me, *hm*?
AphroditeMiscPickup14|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 14|Aphrodite|I'd ask you show me a good time, there, love, although I almost can't imagine a good time where you reside! So dreary, constantly!
AphroditeMiscPickup15|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 15|Aphrodite|I missed you terribly, my little godling! All that I ask is that you do not die on me again, why, I don't think that I can take it anymore!
AphroditeMiscPickup16|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 16|Aphrodite|How you must yearn to reach the surface, little godling! It likewise stirs in me a yearning to assist you, by all means at my disposal!
AphroditeMiscPickup17|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 17|Aphrodite|No need to worry any longer, dearest! I bring you strength and comfort, and I shall be watching every step of yours most carefully.
AphroditeMiscPickup18|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 18|Aphrodite|Ah, how I long to see you face-to-face! Until such time, however, this old means of keeping touch shall have to do. So you take care, now, *hm*?
AphroditeMiscPickup19|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 19|Aphrodite|You know I would do anything to have you here among us, don't you, love? Oh, I just hope my blessings are enough...!
AphroditeMiscPickup20|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 20|Aphrodite|Love tends to blossom in the strangest places at the strangest times, you know that, don't you, dearest? All one can do is entertain the chance.
AphroditeMiscPickup21|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 21|Aphrodite|Don't work yourself too hard down there, you promise, little godling? We need you in good shape and spirits on Olympus here.
AphroditeMiscPickup22|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 22|Aphrodite|What do you say we skip the chat and get right to it, *hm*?
AphroditeMiscPickup23|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 23|Aphrodite|Oh, would you look at whom I found, all by his lonely self.
AphroditeMiscPickup24|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 24|Aphrodite|Let's see what mischief we can make, between the two of us!
AphroditeMiscPickup25|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 25|Aphrodite|You want my blessings, dearest, here they are!
AphroditeMiscPickup26|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 26|Aphrodite|I hope I didn't keep you waiting very long, did I?
AphroditeMiscPickup27|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 27|Aphrodite|Even immortal hearts can break, my little godling.
AphroditeMiscPickup28|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 28|Aphrodite|What do you say we go and make new friends together, *hm*?
AphroditeMiscPickup29|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 29|Aphrodite|You seem like you could use a helping hand, there, love.
AphroditeMiscPickup30|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 30|Aphrodite|The bond of love is strong enough to suffer any hardship, dearest.
AphroditeMiscPickup31|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 31|Aphrodite|Times of adversity make love grow even stronger, little godling.
AphroditeMiscPickup32|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 32|Aphrodite|I hate to see you struggling, dearest! Please do be careful, *hm*?
AphroditeMiscPickup33|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 33|Aphrodite|Love conquers everything, you see that, don't you, dearest?
AphroditeMiscPickup34|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 34|Aphrodite|Think of all those you love, and may they spur your courage, little godling.
AphroditeMiscPickup35|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 35|Aphrodite|Your passion to achieve your goal is quite inspiring, I have to say!
AphroditeMiscPickup36|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 36|Aphrodite|It's such a pity I can barely see you in that awful darkness, little godling.
AphroditeMiscPickup37|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 37|Aphrodite|Love spurs the heart to greater acts of valor, doesn't it, dearest?
AphroditeMiscPickup38|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 38|Aphrodite|Take heart, now, little godling. And how about you take this from me, as well.
AphroditeMiscPickup39|Aphrodite Misc Pickup 39|Aphrodite|I'd love to help you however best I'm able, my little godling.
AphroditeMiscPickupRare01|Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 01|Aphrodite|I have the loveliest selection of my blessings for you this time, dearest!
AphroditeMiscPickupRare02|Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 02|Aphrodite|I think I'll give you something very special this time, little godling.
AphroditeMiscPickupRare03|Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 03|Aphrodite|Is not the purest act of love to aid somebody in their time of need?
AphroditeMiscPickupRare04|Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 04|Aphrodite|I'm feeling wonderful of late, dearest, so here, enjoy the benefits!
AphroditeLootBought01|Aphrodite Loot Bought 01|Aphrodite|Looks like we meet again, dearest, here among the foul detritus of the boatman's wares! You truly take me to the best of places!
AphroditeLootBought02|Aphrodite Loot Bought 02|Aphrodite|At first I didn't know how to get through to that odd river-boatman, Charon. Turns out he lusts for coin, and now I understand him well!
AphroditeLootBought03|Aphrodite Loot Bought 03|Aphrodite|You spent your hard-earned wealth on my account, dearest? Why if that isn't just the sweetest thing!
AphroditeLootBought04|Aphrodite Loot Bought 04|Aphrodite|One cannot put a price on love, but on my blessings, from the boatman, for my dearest? I'd say we're settled up.
AphroditeRejection01|Aphrodite Rejection 01|Aphrodite|And here I was beginning to think that we had something special going, no...? Look here, little godling, let me save you lots of future suffering: I happen to be the jealous type.
AphroditeRejection02|Aphrodite Rejection 02|Aphrodite|You'd best not take for granted my affection, godling. Yes, I've lots of it to go around; but I can just as easily rescind such privileges.
AphroditeRejection03|Aphrodite Rejection 03|Aphrodite|They say a lot of things about me, dearest; and they'll tell you, in your dealings with me, ample caution is in order. Let me show you why.
AphroditeRejection04|Aphrodite Rejection 04|Aphrodite|Don't *ever *take me for some thoughtless nymph to be manipulated, dearest. I expect reciprocal devotion from you. Do you understand?
AphroditeRejection05|Aphrodite Rejection 05|Aphrodite|Oh, *really*? You shall find I don't take such rejections lying down. And you shall find it out the hard way.
AphroditeRejection06|Aphrodite Rejection 06|Aphrodite|If it's your wish to test the limits of the fine relationship we've built, why then... I can confirm you're testing them, all right!
AphroditeRejection07|Aphrodite Rejection 07|Aphrodite|Now, dearest... surely there's no way that could have been one of the wiser choices that you've lately made?
AphroditeRejection08|Aphrodite Rejection 08|Aphrodite|Dearest, just in case it hasn't been made clear as crystal lately, let me tell you: When presented with the opportunity, don't *ever *reject me.
AphroditeRejection09|Aphrodite Rejection 09|Aphrodite|You'd spurn my love this easily, dearest? You are about to find the consequences are much harder to dismiss without a second thought.
AphroditeRejection10|Aphrodite Rejection 10|Aphrodite|I must admit I'm unaccustomed to rejection, love. But *you *must be accustomed to swift death! Here comes one for you now.
AphroditeRejection11|Aphrodite Rejection 11|Aphrodite|Oh, but this is such a heartbreak, dearest! Why would you do that? You know that I won't take this lying down.
AphroditeRejection12|Aphrodite Rejection 12|Aphrodite|You *dare *to play with *my *heart, little godling? I'll just take yours, and shatter it to pieces, then, I think!
AphroditeRejection13|Aphrodite Rejection 13|Aphrodite|Sometimes I think that you're quite *different *than most all the others here, darling. And then, you go and do something like *this*.
AphroditeRejection14|Aphrodite Rejection 14|Aphrodite|You think you can brush me aside like that? Well, I think I can crush you into tiny, little bits! Let's see who's right, shall we?
AphroditeMakeUp01|Aphrodite Make Up 01|Aphrodite|Let's say we kissed and made up, dearest. Just, do not anger me again, or I might come down and kill you there myself!
AphroditeMakeUp02|Aphrodite Make Up 02|Aphrodite|Alas that passion sometimes drives me into vengeance, dearest! Yet, who among us isn't without vices, *hm*?
AphroditeMakeUp03|Aphrodite Make Up 03|Aphrodite|Oh, how I hate to fight with you like this! Let's forgive each other and forget, go back to how things used to be?
AphroditeMakeUp04|Aphrodite Make Up 04|Aphrodite|I'm not angry with you any longer, dearest! Though, might I suggest you take some extra steps to keep it that way, hm?
AphroditeMakeUp05|Aphrodite Make Up 05|Aphrodite|A loving heart is a forgiving heart, don't you agree? So I shall let this little matter slide, and you've my loving heart to thank for it, *hm-hm*!
AphroditeMakeUp06|Aphrodite Make Up 06|Aphrodite|The truth is I'm a lover, not a fighter, dearest. So how about we call this matter put to bed, and get on with our lives?
AphroditeMakeUp07|Aphrodite Make Up 07|Aphrodite|I'd say this little squabble can be put to bed, for now. I'm better for the moment, but I was very angry with you, love!
AphroditeMakeUp08|Aphrodite Make Up 08|Aphrodite|I cannot bring myself to stay upset with you forever, little godling, so let's move along from that small misunderstanding there.
AphroditeMakeUp09|Aphrodite Make Up 09|Aphrodite|There is no common sense with love, godling, so... why don't we pretend your indiscretion there did not occur.
AphroditeMakeUp10|Aphrodite Make Up 10|Aphrodite|It is through times of difficulty that the love we share is tested and reforged. But you just watch yourself when testing it like that.
AphroditeMakeUp11|Aphrodite Make Up 11|Aphrodite|Love and jealousy go hand in hand, don't they, dearest? Although the former's much more pleasant, isn't it.
AphroditeMakeUp12|Aphrodite Make Up 12|Aphrodite|Oh, all this fighting! It's just not like us at *all*, dearest! Let's say we kissed and then made up, all right?
AphroditeGift01|Aphrodite Gift 01|Zagreus|Lady Aphrodite, I am truly blessed simply to have made your acquaintance, so, this is for you.
AphroditeGift01|Aphrodite Gift 01|Aphrodite|Lasting relationships are built on reciprocity. So if you lavish me with gifts, why, what am I to do but give you something in return?
AphroditeGift02|Aphrodite Gift 02|Zagreus|My lady Aphrodite, if not for our acquaintance, I am certain that my days or nights would be much drearier indeed.
AphroditeGift02|Aphrodite Gift 02|Aphrodite|Why, dearest, such a wonderfully thoughtful gift, for me? I love it, and I would be lying if I said you shouldn't have!
AphroditeGift03|Aphrodite Gift 03|Zagreus|Lady Aphrodite, I'm afraid there really isn't much here worthy of you, but perhaps this can suffice.
AphroditeGift03|Aphrodite Gift 03|Aphrodite|My, but if this isn't such a treasure to behold, and I accept it as a sign of your affection! Of something even more, perhaps...?
AphroditeGift04|Aphrodite Gift 04|Zagreus|Dear Aphrodite, surely you have all the offerings you can stand, but I would ask that you accept one more.
AphroditeGift04|Aphrodite Gift 04|Aphrodite|Ah, dearest, but it stirs my heart to know you care so deeply for our wonderful relationship! To celebrate it with such princely gifts!
AphroditeGift05|Aphrodite Gift 05|Zagreus|Dear Aphrodite, the incomparable beauty of Olympus is less difficult to fathom, having already met you. I am so grateful to have earned your favor.
AphroditeGift05|Aphrodite Gift 05|Aphrodite|My, but don't *you *come on rather strong, there, little godling! Though, I can take much more of your affections, you shall see!
AphroditeGift06|Aphrodite Gift 06|Zagreus|Aphrodite, you must have more worshipers and suitors than all your kin upon Olympus combined. I may not fall exactly into either category, though I hope you know my gratitude for all you've done for me is true.
AphroditeGift06|Aphrodite Gift 06|Aphrodite|You know, dearest, I am more worshiped than perhaps anybody else upon Olympus! You'd think getting such praise would roll right off my back by now, but no! I love receiving it. Especially from you.
AphroditeGift07|Aphrodite Gift 07|Zagreus|My lady Aphrodite, once more you've graced me with your presence and your favor, which inspire the best from me. Let this modest gift of Ambrosia signify I'm forever in your debt.
AphroditeGift07|Aphrodite Gift 07|Aphrodite|My little godling. I'd say you've honored me more times than I could count, but that would be a lie, now, wouldn't it. I so admire your devotion and your perseverance! If ever you do reach us on Olympus, I should very much enjoy getting to know you even better, then.
DionysusWithZeus01|Duo - Dionysus and Zeus (1)|Dionysus|Hey Zag, my Dad, he's here and wants to have a word, be cool man, go along with what he says, OK?
DionysusWithZeus01|Duo - Dionysus and Zeus (1)|Zeus|That Dionysus, always much too kind with introductions, though at least he shows me suitable respect. Perhaps someday he can instruct you in the customs of Olympus here.
DionysusWithPoseidon01|Duo - Dionysus and Poseidon (1)|Dionysus|*Uh*, Zag, *erm*... your uncle's passing through. Not Dad, *erm*, the other one I mean, and he just wanted to check in, see how you're doing, so...
DionysusWithPoseidon01|Duo - Dionysus and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|*Ah-hah*, there you are, my little nephew! Dionysus showing you the ropes, or what? You want a real feast, though, you just stick with *me*! Now take my blessing, *go*!
DionysusWithPoseidon01|Duo - Dionysus and Poseidon (1)|Dionysus|*Oh*, anyway we're here, man, waiting up for you! We know you're going to make it, I would say eventually?
DionysusWithAthena01|Duo - Dionysus and Athena (1)|Dionysus|Hey, Zag, when you arrive, it's going to be a real scene, I'll tell you now! Even Athena here will cut loose for a bit, let down her hair, you know, put on something more comfy, yeah, it's going to be *great*!
DionysusWithAthena01|Duo - Dionysus and Athena (1)|Athena|Perhaps Lord Dionysus here is the true god of strategy, as it appears he is uncannily aware of my next move, Cousin. Although, be that as it may, I shall attempt to remain focused on your situation. Not his feast.
DionysusWithAres01|Duo - Dionysus and Ares (1)|Dionysus|You know, Zag, maybe once you get here, you could get old Ares to just lighten up a little, you know, man? Always dragging down the mood, with talk of blood, and nastiness, all sorts of stuff like that!
DionysusWithAres01|Duo - Dionysus and Ares (1)|Ares|Why, my Lord Dionysus! I fail to see why such discussion is perceived as unbecoming of a feast. A successfully conducted war is certainly a cause for celebration, is it not?
DionysusWithAphrodite01|Duo - Dionysus and Aphrodite (1)|Dionysus|Look, Zag, you should know by now that when it comes to feasting, it's Yours Truly here who puts on the best performance. But I do have Lady Aphrodite's help!
DionysusWithAphrodite01|Duo - Dionysus and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|Wine does have a rather special way of making everybody look even more beautiful than ever, Dionysus dear! And from such beauty, why, long-lasting love is born! And also shorter-lasting love, much of the time.
DionysusWithArtemis01|Duo - Dionysus and Artemis (1)|Dionysus|Zag, man, I was just attempting here to get our good friend Artemis to finally make an appearance at one of my feasts, it's just... wouldn't you know, she's all preoccupied, something about a hunt?
DionysusWithArtemis01|Duo - Dionysus and Artemis (1)|Artemis|That's right, Lord Dionysus, a *hunt*! Which requires lots and lots of *total quiet*, and clear-minded focus. So, if you'll excuse me?
DionysusWithDemeter01|Duo - Dionysus and Demeter (1)|Dionysus|Hey Zag, got a favor here I mean to ask, could you maybe persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up on the whole *'not let anything grow' *thing she's been going on about?
DionysusWithDemeter01|Duo - Dionysus and Demeter (1)|Demeter|I daresay, my Lord Dionysus, that partaking of less wine for some amount of time might do you good. Regardless, you'll not coax a better crop from me.
DionysusAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Dionysus About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Hope this lives up to your expectations, mate. In the name of Hades! Olympus? This is an official message! Should be a good time, Lord Dionysus!
DionysusAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Dionysus About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Dionysus|Whoa, hold just for a moment, Zag, now, I can recognize an invite when I see one, man! And this is definitely almost certainly some sort of invite, one for me, and... one for everybody else, it looks like, here? Hoh, I'm excited, that is something really special, I can tell!
DionysusPostEpilogue01|Dionysus Post Epilogue 01|Dionysus|Look, Zag, I don't entirely recall what happened at that feast you threw for all of us down there, but let me tell you, I am under the impression it went *smashingly*! It was *amazing*, man! Let's have another one sometime, all right?
DionysusAboutZeus01|Dionysus About Zeus 01|Dionysus|So Zag, you met my dad by now, your uncle Zeus? He's cool and loves a feasting, just... be sure to keep him in your thoughts. OK?
DionysusAboutPoseidon01|Dionysus About Poseidon 01|Dionysus|*Hoh-ho*, no way Zag, looking like you got yourself a gift from old Poseidon there? He's quite the catch, but here, hope you saved some room for more!
DionysusAboutAthena01|Dionysus About Athena 01|Dionysus|Hey man, I heard Athena had a word with you already yeah? She's cool, though, once you get to know her. Here! I got something that ought to suit her style.
DionysusAboutAphrodite01|Dionysus About Aphrodite 01|Dionysus|*Whoa*, hey, you must have had a run-in with the lovely Aphrodite, am I right, or am I right, there Zag? But I have *just *the thing to go with her!
DionysusAboutArtemis01|Dionysus About Artemis 01|Dionysus|Hey, Zag, got to tell you, I cannot believe that little Artemis is hanging out with you! She doesn't hang with anybody, man! But I digress, take this!
DionysusAboutAres01|Dionysus About Ares 01|Dionysus|You hanging out with Ares, are you, Zag? He's quite the chap, I'll give him that, I'll give him that, and now, I'll give you *this*!
DionysusAboutDemeter01|Dionysus About Demeter 01|Dionysus|Felt a shiver in the air just now, and that can only mean that chilly Demeter decided to give you a little help, there, huh? Or maybe it's just cold, I mean, this is a mountaintop!
DionysusAboutHadesKeepsake01|Dionysus About Hades Keepsake 01|Dionysus|Hey, Zag, uh... I may just be losing it or something here, but isn't that your dad's own blessing that you've got? That's something, man, I didn't know that he was helping you!
DionysusPostGiftPickup01|Dionysus Post Gift Pickup 01|Dionysus|Now how's my favorite Underworld god surviving, Zag, you holding up or what? Right better momentarily, I bet!
DionysusPostGiftPickup02|Dionysus Post Gift Pickup 02|Dionysus|Man oh man, Zag, someday you will be the guest of honor at the *biggest *feast that you have *ever *seen! Though I know you have got your hands full for the time, so, first things first!
DionysusBackstory01|Dionysus Backstory 01|Dionysus|Sometimes I have to wonder, man, what's going through your head, I mean, I know you hear me and the others but it's so damn dark down there I can't hear you at all!
DionysusBackstory02|Dionysus Backstory 02|Dionysus|Let me tell you something, Zag, I know your dad he's got to be a real handful, I relate to that, you understand me, mate? So you get out of there, and you'll be more than welcome here, with us!
DionysusHighRelationship01|Dionysus High Relationship 01|Dionysus|I've got a feeling this time, man, like things are really going to take a turn for you, and I mean for the better, almost certainly, I think!
DionysusHighRelationship02|Dionysus High Relationship 02|Dionysus|The key to any halfway decent feast is lots and lots of preparation, man. Or maybe just having to improvise, you know?
DionysusRunProgress01|Dionysus Run Progress 01|Dionysus|I got to hand it to you, Zag, you don't back down, you don't ever back down, what is this, like the twentieth time that you've attempted to escape?
DionysusRunProgress02|Dionysus Run Progress 02|Dionysus|You're getting somewhere, getting somewhere, man, I understand you made it up to Asphodel before, now that is progress, keep it up, you keep on going, yeah?
DionysusRunProgress03|Dionysus Run Progress 03|Dionysus|Heard you wrestled with some Satyrs near the surface, Zag! Nice work making it that far, and I just want to let you know that they are definitely not my crew, man! Satyrs I know aren't like that at all!
DionysusRunCleared01|Dionysus Run Cleared 01|Dionysus|Ah, Zag, what *happened *last time, man? It seemed like you were rather close, but then, we couldn't see you anymore from here, and now you're back? Well, give another go!
DionysusRunCleared02|Dionysus Run Cleared 02|Dionysus|Want you to know something, here, man. It's been a bit of a long haul, but you are getting closer to the surface, and you'll get there someday, and we're with you, however long it takes, OK?
DionysusPostEpilogue02|Dionysus Post Epilogue 02|Dionysus|Hey, back when we had that feast, there, man, I, I hope I didn't, you know, make for any inconveniences or anything down there, did I...?
DionysusPostEpilogue03|Dionysus Post Epilogue 03|Dionysus|Zag, I cannot believe your mom's Persephone, that's something else, I got to tell you, man! I never took her for the sort to be all into Underworld stuff!
DionysusAboutKeepsake01|Dionysus About Keepsake 01|Dionysus|Say, isn't that the Overflowing Cup I handed down to you, I'm glad you like it, man! I guess it's overflowing still, because I figure otherwise I couldn't tell at all!
DionysusAboutNectar01|Dionysus About Nectar 01|Dionysus|You, man, must be mates with just about *everybody *down there, by now, yeah? Doling out Nectars left and right, just livening the place right up!
DionysusAboutNectar02|Dionysus About Nectar 02|Dionysus|Say, let me just point out you've got a lot of Nectar on you, man! Oh, I can tell, I like the stuff a lot, myself, but even I don't pack *that *much, and I mean, *wow*!
DionysusAboutAmbrosia01|Dionysus About Ambrosia 01|Dionysus|Say, man, if I'm not mistaken, I think you got yourself a bottle of Ambrosia, there? I'd no idea you could get that stuff downstairs! Do me a solid, though, hang on to any more you find, or better yet, give it away! I'd hate to think even a drop has gone to waste!
DionysusAboutAmbrosia02|Dionysus About Ambrosia 02|Dionysus|Well, would you just look at yourself, Zag! You are like a walking stockpile of Ambrosia, aren't you? Taking the best care of it, at that. I knew I could count on you, but... *<Sniff> *I didn't know I could be just so proud of you, you know, man?
DionysusAboutAmbrosia03|Dionysus About Ambrosia 03|Dionysus|Zag, turns out I am quite the judge of character, and you, man, have an *awful *lot of it, I mean, you've given out how much Ambrosia now? To *all *your mates, and *more*?!
DionysusAboutAmbrosia04|Dionysus About Ambrosia 04|Dionysus|You got to let me in on something, Zag, how did you gather up so much Ambrosia, there? I mean, sometimes I think the stuff is plentiful up here, but you are positively swimming in it, man!
DionysusAboutGifting01|Dionysus About Gifting 01|Dionysus|You are the talk of the mountain, you know that, man? Good on you, getting on just about everybody's good side up here, I mean, that is a feat, all right!
DionysusAboutOrpheus01|Dionysus About Orpheus 01|Dionysus|Hey Zag, ever see a fellow by the name of Orpheus down there, you ever heard of him? I bet you have, and I have had a funny thought, a little jest that maybe we could try, if you'd be up to have a little harmless fun?
DionysusAboutOrpheus01|Dionysus About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|Harmless fun at the expense of Orpheus? You have my full and complete attention, Dionysus mate.
DionysusAboutOrpheus01|Dionysus About Orpheus 01|Dionysus|...That chap comes up with the most smashing songs, so I was thinking, maybe we could spin him a tall tale, something like how maybe you and I, like, we're connected or something? He'll buy it, tell him, tell him for me, yeah?!
DionysusAboutOrpheus02|Dionysus About Orpheus 02|Dionysus|*Hahaha*, Zag! I heard you got to Orpheus, he's got this whole entire ballad now, about how you are really me, or maybe it's the other way around, I've no idea, *hahahaha*! Here!
DionysusAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Dionysus About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Dionysus|Zag, I heard that Orpheus, he found his missing bride, why, isn't that the sweetest thing, isn't it, man? I'll drink to that, and I think so should you!
DionysusVsMeg01|Dionysus Vs Meg 01|Dionysus|*Erm*, hey, man, you been having some bad run-ins with that Fury, Megaera, is that her name? Now isn't she a real firebrand! Maybe this'll help you out next time you meet!
DionysusAboutMegRelationship01|Dionysus About Meg Relationship 01|Dionysus|Whoa, Zag, heard you're hanging with the Fury Megaera of late, well cheers to that, man, bet she's something else, but you just watch for that whip of hers, OK?
DionysusAboutMegRelationship02|Dionysus About Meg Relationship 02|Dionysus|Hey man, I'm hearing up here that you got in good with Megaera, the Fury, is that right, I mean, I hope it is, because, *hahaha, yeow*, know what I mean? They say she's something else!
DionysusAboutThanRelationship01|Dionysus About Than Relationship 01|Dionysus|Hey, you're in good with Thanatos, isn't that right? A real broody sort, sometimes I think maybe I ought to just invite him to a feast, but then, what if he cools the whole thing down, makes everybody kind of *ehhhhh*, you know?
DionysusVsTheseus01|Dionysus Vs Theseus 01|Dionysus|Heard that you took care of Theseus down in Elysium of late, there, Zag! Nice work, never liked that one, between us. There's this nice lass helped him out one time, and he just dumped her rotten, I don't like that, man!
DionysusAboutYarn01|Dionysus About Yarn 01|Dionysus|Why, you've a Yarn of Ariadne, right there, Zag, I know the lass for whom that yarn is named! She was a right attractive one, we had our little time, long story, though, will save it till you get here!
DionysusLowHealth01|Dionysus Low Health 01|Dionysus|Whoaa Zag, man, you look positively knackered, you be sure and take it easy if you can out there, all right? Here, maybe this'll help!
DionysusLowHealth02|Dionysus Low Health 02|Dionysus|*Oof*, Zag, look, I know you're not in a good spot right now, you must be really out of sorts! Though maybe *this *might numb the pain a bit!

DionysusMiscPickup04|Dionysus Misc Pickup 04|Dionysus|Hey Zag, how is life, you hanging in there, yeah? I reckoned maybe we could raise a glass here, to your health, but then I thought, *'No, wait! I can do a little more than that!*' So, here we go!
DionysusMiscPickup05|Dionysus Misc Pickup 05|Dionysus|Hey, how you living life down there right now, all right I take it, yeah? No, wait, though, I have just the thing!
DionysusMiscPickup06|Dionysus Misc Pickup 06|Dionysus|Why, hello, Zag! Fancy running into you, though there's no need to work yourself so hard, you hear me, yeah? I reckon this should take the edge right off!
DionysusMiscPickup07|Dionysus Misc Pickup 07|Dionysus|How goes it this time, man, everything fine? Though hold that thought, I wager we can make things finer yet!
DionysusMiscPickup08|Dionysus Misc Pickup 08|Dionysus|That Underworld of yours, place is a real pit, isn't it Zag, a shame you're stuck down there. But we are going to get you out of there, together, you and I!

DionysusMiscPickup11|Dionysus Misc Pickup 11|Dionysus|You got this, man! I *so *believe in you, it's almost like the Greeks believe in me! And they believe in me an awful lot, you know!
DionysusMiscPickup12|Dionysus Misc Pickup 12|Dionysus|Time for another go at getting out of there, eh, Zag? Well not to worry, we'll make something happen, let's hop to it then!

DionysusMiscPickup16|Dionysus Misc Pickup 16|Dionysus|It's me, Zag, hey, I know you haven't got a lot of time to listen to me prattle on like this, and so, I'm cutting to the chase here, look!

DionysusMiscPickup36|Dionysus Misc Pickup 36|Dionysus|This here, Zag, is among the best I have to offer, it is good!
DionysusMiscPickup37|Dionysus Misc Pickup 37|Dionysus|I'm feeling really good right now, and thought I'd pass that right along!
DionysusMiscPickup38|Dionysus Misc Pickup 38|Dionysus|Here's something extra special for you, man, now cheers!
DionysusMiscPickupExtra01|Dionysus Misc Pickup Extra 01|Dionysus|Past time we got things going for you there, what do you say, you ready for this, man?

DionysusMiscPickupRare01|Dionysus Misc Pickup Rare 01|Dionysus|Have I got just the thing for you, here, man, you ready? Here we go!
DionysusMiscPickupRare02|Dionysus Misc Pickup Rare 02|Dionysus|What do you say we go *all out *this time, how about it, Zag, you with me, man, or what?
DionysusMiscPickupRare03|Dionysus Misc Pickup Rare 03|Dionysus|Been saving something for the right occasion, though I figure it's as good a time as any, yeah?
DionysusMiscPickupRare04|Dionysus Misc Pickup Rare 04|Dionysus|Hey, cheers to you, and everything you do, there, Zag! Only the best from me to you, man!
DionysusLootBought01|Dionysus Loot Bought 01|Dionysus|Heeey, what's, uh, with that Charon, man, he's sort of, *I-don't-know*, though I am glad he's been of service!
DionysusLootBought02|Dionysus Loot Bought 02|Dionysus|*Ah-hah*, you found me holing up in Charon's nasty stash there did you man, well good, good, here!
DionysusLootBought03|Dionysus Loot Bought 03|Dionysus|Looks like you are stocked for one hell of a night down there, man! I knew Charon would hook you up with what you need!
DionysusLootBought04|Dionysus Loot Bought 04|Dionysus|Hey, cheers for picking up the tab, there, Zag, now, I cannot exactly pay you back, though I could give you *this*!
DionysusLootBought05|Dionysus Loot Bought 05|Dionysus|I bet that Charon has to be the life of every feast you have down there, with such a personality, am I not right about that, man?
DionysusRejection01|Dionysus Rejection 01|Dionysus|Oh, come *on*, Zag, and here I thought that we were cool. You hurt my pride, there, man. I guess I'm going to have to hurt yours....
DionysusRejection02|Dionysus Rejection 02|Dionysus|Ohhh man, that was definitely not a thing to do, I mean, are we best mates, or not...? You think on that, while I do *this*.
DionysusRejection03|Dionysus Rejection 03|Dionysus|Look Zag, I'm not going to lie, you hurt my feelings here, I thought we had a thing! A close familial bond! I'm really *mad *now that I think on it!
DionysusRejection04|Dionysus Rejection 04|Dionysus|What, you wouldn't hang with me given the choice? I thought I had you sorted, man, but maybe you just don't appreciate the finer things!
DionysusRejection05|Dionysus Rejection 05|Dionysus|Ah, come on, Zag, now that was not the choice I would have made, you messing with me, man? All right! I'll mess with *you*.
DionysusRejection06|Dionysus Rejection 06|Dionysus|*Ohh*, we all make mistakes from time to time, man, and you ought to know! You made one there just now!
DionysusRejection07|Dionysus Rejection 07|Dionysus|Why do it to me like that, Zag, man, I thought we were close as grapes upon the vine, but I was wrong?
DionysusRejection09|Dionysus Rejection 09|Dionysus|Did I do something to deserve this, man, because I thought that we were getting on just fine, better than fine, but this?
DionysusRejection10|Dionysus Rejection 10|Dionysus|It's not that I'm upset or anything, here, Zag, you know I'm not, but truthfully I am a bit annoyed, a little bit, and so, I got to send the message, man.
DionysusRejection11|Dionysus Rejection 11|Dionysus|Really, man? After everything we've been through together, *this *is the gratitude I get?
DionysusRejection12|Dionysus Rejection 12|Dionysus|Well, way to spoil the feast, there, Zag, I mean come on, I thought I was your mate? Was I mistaken, man?
DionysusRejection13|Dionysus Rejection 13|Dionysus|Zag, I can take a jest, ask anybody, but when it comes to competition here, it's not a laughing matter! Do you understand me, man?
DionysusMakeUp01|Dionysus Make Up 01|Dionysus|All right, all right, all right, we're cool, we're cool, no need to get all hot and bothered any longer, here!
DionysusMakeUp02|Dionysus Make Up 02|Dionysus|OK, let's say we're settled up now, Zag, and go on being best mates just like before, yeah?
DionysusMakeUp03|Dionysus Make Up 03|Dionysus|You know, Zag, you are not so bad, just had a little lapse in judgment, happens to me all the time, now let's get on with it!
DionysusMakeUp04|Dionysus Make Up 04|Dionysus|Hey, now, that was quite a sight, I got to hand it to you, man, and you *deserve *this, here!
DionysusMakeUp05|Dionysus Make Up 05|Dionysus|Know what, man, I'm not even angry after that. What was I even going off about, do you recall...?
DionysusMakeUp06|Dionysus Make Up 06|Dionysus|OK, all right, it's fine already, Zag, you win this time and I am good as grapes.
DionysusMakeUp07|Dionysus Make Up 07|Dionysus|Appreciate your understanding, there, man, so let's just avoid this type of little shake-up next time, yeah?
DionysusMakeUp08|Dionysus Make Up 08|Dionysus|*Hahahahahah*, OK, thanks for a good laugh, there, Zag, what was it I was going on about, before...?
DionysusMakeUp09|Dionysus Make Up 09|Dionysus|Oh I just can't stay mad about you, Zag, and to be honest, why, I wasn't that mad to begin with, I just thought I'd shake your branches up a bit!
DionysusMakeUp10|Dionysus Make Up 10|Dionysus|You're all right, man, you're all right, don't even worry about the rough patch we just crossed back there, we're stronger than all that!
DionysusMakeUp11|Dionysus Make Up 11|Dionysus|I figured this time I'd stay mad at you for sure, man, but you know what, I just couldn't! No matter how hard I tried.
DionysusMakeUp12|Dionysus Make Up 12|Dionysus|It's like I always say, Zag, you have got to permit yourself a bad time every now and again to really appreciate all the good times, yeah?
DionysusMakeUp12|Dionysus Make Up 12|Dionysus|Know what, man, just forget about what happened, yeah? 'Cause I already did, I mean, it happens, right?
DionysusGift01|Dionysus Gift 01|Zagreus|Lord Dionysus, it's been great getting to know you, so, please accept this humble offering.
DionysusGift01|Dionysus Gift 01|Dionysus|Now that is something, a right princely gift, there, Zag, and just so happens I got something here I have been meaning to give you!
DionysusGift02|Dionysus Gift 02|Zagreus|A toast in your honor, Lord Dionysus mate. Have I mentioned how pleased I am to have made your acquaintance?
DionysusGift02|Dionysus Gift 02|Dionysus|*Hoh-oh*, what, is that for me, *really*, I mean, cheers man, that is awful generous of you, I'm much obliged!
DionysusGift03|Dionysus Gift 03|Zagreus|Lord Dionysus mate, you have made the mood down here materially less miserable, and I am much obliged.
DionysusGift03|Dionysus Gift 03|Dionysus|What, is that for me, why Zag, I mean you really shouldn't have, you know I can't get enough of this stuff, right?
DionysusGift04|Dionysus Gift 04|Zagreus|Lord Dionysus mate, you must have no shortage of supreme vintage at your disposal, but this one's from me.
DionysusGift04|Dionysus Gift 04|Dionysus|Why Zag, how positively thoughtful, man, I mean I love it, positively love this stuff, and I am very moved that you would think of me for it!
DionysusGift05|Dionysus Gift 05|Zagreus|Hey, on no occasion whatsoever, cheers to you again, Lord Dionysus mate! This place is so much less dreary under your influence!
DionysusGift05|Dionysus Gift 05|Dionysus|Ah, this is the greatest, Zag! This feast I'm headed to? I was getting a little concerned I wasn't going to have quite enough to go around for everyone. Well, you just saved my evening, man! Too bad you couldn't be there, yeah?
DionysusGift06|Dionysus Gift 06|Zagreus|Dionysus mate, sometimes things weigh heavily on me, but then I hear from you, and it's like I don't have a care in the world! To your health!
DionysusGift06|Dionysus Gift 06|Dionysus|Oh, you're really too much for me sometimes, you know that, man? Got to tell you, I don't think I ever felt so close to somebody so damn far away. But through the gift of drink? It's like we're with each other in spirit, all the time, you know?
DionysusGift07|Dionysus Gift 07|Zagreus|What does one offer to the god of wine? The very best, is what, and down here, this is it, mate! I'm grateful I've got some of your spirit in me. To have such a connection, with you despite all the distance between us...!
DionysusGift07|Dionysus Gift 07|Dionysus|Zag, I cannot believe what you are offering to me! Ambrosia, man, for *me*? And talk about a bottle that has seen some wild days and nights, I mean if it got all the way to you down there, only to come back up! Know what? I'm saving it, till we can share it, here!
AthenaWithZeus01|Duo - Athena and Zeus (1)|Athena|Noble cousin, my lord father has taken keen interest in your journey and your plight, and now seeks to aid you with the thunder of heaven itself. And you've my support, as well, of course.
AthenaWithZeus01|Duo - Athena and Zeus (1)|Zeus|I thank you for the generous introduction, fair Athena, and I always rest assured when you are close at hand. I trust with our combined might, our good Zagreus is virtually certain to succeed!
AthenaWithPoseidon01|Duo - Athena and Poseidon (1)|Athena|When I first notified Lord Father Zeus and other members of our family of your existence, Zagreus, it was Uncle Poseidon here who first leapt up, and pledged his power over sea and earth to you. Is that not so, Uncle?
AthenaWithPoseidon01|Duo - Athena and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|Exactly so, Athena! You, with that fine memory of yours! For it isn't everyday I learn my doleful brother Hades sired a fine son! He does not know how good he has it, there! And *you*, Nephew, could have it even better, *here*!
AthenaWithAphrodite01|Duo - Athena and Aphrodite (1)|Athena|Your predicament has pulled our family together, united in a desire to assist you, Cousin. Even those who typically do not think much of those other than themselves.
AthenaWithAphrodite01|Duo - Athena and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|Oh, if only I had wisdom such as yours, Athena dear, so that I was more capable of picking up on subtle jabs and insults such as that! You're not fooling anybody with your feigned benevolence, you know.
AthenaWithAphrodite01|Duo - Athena and Aphrodite (1)|Athena|The world is not all lies and deceit as you make it out to be, Aphrodite. Sometimes, a lending of assistance is no more than it appears to be. Now either back up Zagreus, or stand aside.
AthenaWithArtemis01|Duo - Athena and Artemis (1)|Athena|If you've a moment, Zagreus? One of my relatives has claimed that I usurp your time. So I invited her to contact you.
AthenaWithArtemis01|Duo - Athena and Artemis (1)|Artemis|Um, hello, Zagreus... Athena here is grandstanding or trying to prove a point, or something. I don't know. Anyway, nice talking to you.
AthenaWithArtemis01|Duo - Athena and Artemis (1)|Athena|Well, I suppose that's settled, then. I am afraid such interactions aren't uncommon here amongst my family; but what's a family without flaws?
AthenaWithDionysus01|Duo - Athena and Dionysus (1)|Athena|Some members of our family do not yet fully understand just how precarious your situation is, Cousin. My Lord Dionysus here, he goes about as though this is a festive matter of some sort!
AthenaWithDionysus01|Duo - Athena and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|Oh, come on, Athena girl, you really mean to tell me that discovering a long-lost relative isn't a cause for celebrating right away, I mean, you can't be telling me a thing like *that*? Because if Zag isn't a cause for feasting, I don't know what is!
AthenaWithDemeter01|Duo - Athena and Demeter (1)|Athena|I bring to you the Lady Demeter, Cousin. I've asked that she please rest assured knowing we have your matter well under control. Though, in her infinite compassion, she has taken up your cause, nevertheless!
AthenaWithDemeter01|Duo - Athena and Demeter (1)|Demeter|Oh, you needn't lavish me with your faint praise, Athena dear. In all your boundless intellect, I'd have expected you would know I see through your intentions, plain as day.
AthenaAboutDemeter01|Athena About Demeter 01|Athena|The biting cold surrounding you must mean the Goddess of Seasons decided to take an interest in your struggle, Zagreus? I did not count on Demeter being a part of this. Take heart, though use discretion around her.
AthenaAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Athena About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|This is it, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lady Athena, I trust you'll quickly figure this one out.
AthenaAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Athena About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Athena|Is this some kind of offering for me? No, hold a moment, this appears to be a message! Part of one. Then, can this mean...? I have to notify the others. I trust they also have received something from you, or shortly shall.
AthenaPostEpilogue01|Athena Post Epilogue 01|Athena|It was my privilege to have visited your father's House, and briefly had a chance to meet *you*, Zagreus. Nyx and your mother each are very shrewd; perhaps you've taken after both of them. As for your new responsibilities... exposing weak points in defenses is my specialty.
AthenaAboutZeus01|Athena About Zeus 01|Athena|I understand you've been in contact with my father. Your uncle Zeus, I mean. He's taken interest in your plight; you should feel honored!
AthenaAboutPoseidon01|Athena About Poseidon 01|Athena|You've met the master of the seas, Poseidon, haven't you? Our uncle's affable but quick to anger. Be on your guard with him, is my advice.
AthenaAboutAphrodite01|Athena About Aphrodite 01|Athena|Cousin, you've met Aphrodite, no? She likes beguiling others with her charms; but her intentions with you I believe are pure. You'll find our strengths are complementary.
AthenaAboutAres01|Athena About Ares 01|Athena|My warlike brother Ares reached you, didn't he. I've always found his conduct quite disturbing. At least it seems he's helping you for now.
AthenaAboutArtemis01|Athena About Artemis 01|Athena|I'll tell you something, Cousin: If even Artemis is aiding you, it's proof your cause is just. She doesn't often take an interest in family affairs.
AthenaAboutDionysus01|Athena About Dionysus 01|Athena|Did Dionysus truly visit you before? He tends to seek out revelry, not conflict. I'm pleased to know he's making himself useful here.
AthenaAboutHermes01|Athena About Hermes 01|Athena|You arrived sooner than anticipated, Cousin, and my estimations seldom are inaccurate. All for the best, of course. Perhaps you're simply faster than I thought.
AthenaAboutHadesKeepsake01|Athena About Hades Keepsake 01|Athena|Zagreus, perhaps it is a fancy of imagination, but it seems almost as though, this time, you bear the blessing of... your own father! If Lord Hades is assisting you in any way in this, then I shall hold out hope that your relationship yet has capacity to heal, to some extent at least.
AthenaAboutHadesKeepsake02|Athena About Hades Keepsake 02|Athena|So you've another blessing from Lord Hades, then. Zagreus, I'm under no delusion you and your father shall become the closest friends, from here. Neverthless, I do believe it's possible to move forward even such a relationship as yours. Believe me... I know.
AthenaPostGiftPickup01|Athena Post Gift Pickup 01|Athena|I so look forward to our meeting face to face amongst the gods, dear Cousin. Olympus shall be merrier and wiser once you're here.
AthenaPostGiftPickup02|Athena Post Gift Pickup 02|Athena|Hail and good tidings to you, noble Cousin. May you be swift and thorough vanquishing the dead who dare oppose you.
AthenaPostGiftPickup03|Athena Post Gift Pickup 03|Athena|Remain relentless in your effort to escape, dear Cousin. In spite of all our differences, perseverance is a quality we all possess.
AthenaPostGiftPickup04|Athena Post Gift Pickup 04|Athena|You can always count upon assistance from me, Zagreus. I always shall prioritize the needs of our family above everything else.
AthenaPostGiftPickup05|Athena Post Gift Pickup 05|Athena|Let my voice be a glimmer in the darkness, noble Cousin; though, may the blessing I am about to provide be even more than that.
AthenaVsOlympians01|Athena Vs Olympians 01|Athena|You've met your distant relatives by now. We don't all share the same demeanor, nor see eye to eye. Though, all of us, I think, wish you the best.
AthenaBackstory01|Athena Backstory 01|Athena|The one called Nyx... she is your mother, as I understand? We Olympians rarely consort with the chthonic gods. Though Nyx herself reached out to me about your plight, and I was spurred to act.
AthenaBackstory02|Athena Backstory 02|Athena|Please send the goddess Nyx my kind regards. That she supports you in your effort to escape her own domain suggests a selflessness I would not have expected.
AthenaBackstory03|Athena Backstory 03|Athena|It's such a cruelty that your father hid the knowledge of your birth and life from us, my cousin. It's unacceptable.
AthenaBackstory04|Athena Backstory 04|Athena|Your father Hades and my father Zeus have not communicated in some time, and Zeus refuses to explain. Something transpired between the two of them. Perhaps you know better than I.
AthenaBackstory05|Athena Backstory 05|Athena|There's something that I've wished to tell you, Zagreus: There is no shame in your upbringing. Many of us on Olympus, we likewise were born and raised under the strangest circumstances. Someday I'll have to tell you about mine.
AthenaPostFlashback01|Athena Post Flashback 01|Athena|You're nothing like your father, Zagreus. I mean that as a compliment. He cut himself off from the rest of us. Many times have we attempted peace, to no avail.
AthenaRunProgress01|Athena Run Progress 01|Athena|It comforts me to see how far you've come, Cousin. And I am confident that you shall make your way, eventually. I shall look forward to our conversations then.
AthenaRunProgress02|Athena Run Progress 02|Athena|You reached the flames of Asphodel, well done! You may have quite a distance still to go, but having crossed through Tartarus is no small step, Cousin.
AthenaRunProgress03|Athena Run Progress 03|Athena|I see you've made it all the way to hallowed Elysium, Cousin? A significant way toward the surface, and if you could get there the one time, surely you have what it takes to do it again, and overcome the dangers that await therein.
AthenaRunProgress04|Athena Run Progress 04|Athena|I understand you nearly reached the surface lately, Zagreus. My confidence remains unshaken that you shall get out of there, eventually. No matter what sorts of unknown horrors lie shrouded beyond the boundary there.
AthenaRunCleared01|Athena Run Cleared 01|Athena|Were you not close to having reached the surface lately, Cousin? Then, this can only mean some unforeseen impediment prevented your escape.
AthenaRunCleared02|Athena Run Cleared 02|Athena|There must be some unconquerable force or foe awaiting you, just at the border of your realm and ours. We cannot even see it through a shroud of darkness, there. I shall make certain that your family knows it may take considerable time to surpass... so fear not, for we are patient, here.
AthenaRunCleared03|Athena Run Cleared 03|Athena|Despite whatever difficulties you've encountered, dear Cousin, again and again, you have never yielded. I must admit, your strength of will is quite inspiring. For, even I have doubts, from time to time. It's all the clearer to me why the goddess Nyx spoke so highly of you.
AthenaPostEpilogue02|Athena Post Epilogue 02|Athena|It's fortunate your troubles with your mother were resolved. Persephone, I mean! To think I led all of my family to believe your mother was the goddess Nyx, instead. It seems I was an unwitting accomplice to a bit of a deception, there. But Nyx, I know she merely tried to help.
AthenaAboutKeepsake01|Athena About Keepsake 01|Athena|You bear my Owl Pendant, noble Cousin! Wherever it should go, I faintly see its shimmer from afar. Even where you reside! For owls see in total darkness, after all.
AthenaAboutNyx01|Athena About Nyx 01|Athena|I have grown closer than expected with the goddess Nyx in all of this, Cousin. It is quite evident to me how much she cares for you. I must admit I envy your relationship, sometimes. For I've made do without a mother's presence in my life.
AthenaAboutNyx02|Athena About Nyx 02|Athena|Lord Ares has suggested he and goddess Nyx have grown much closer to each other, in all this. Nothing untoward, if you must know. Ares and I have often disagreed, about so many things, and yet we share a fondness for the Night herself, it seems.
AthenaAboutNyx03|Athena About Nyx 03|Athena|Sometimes I think about the goddess Nyx, and how I long for her to be the mother that I never had, Cousin. Is it improper that I say such things to you? One would expect I would already have somebody on Olympus, yet... it often feels as though I am the mother, here.
AthenaAboutQuestLog01|Athena About Quest Log 01|Athena|The goddess Nyx has indicated you possess a list of prophecies from the Three Fates. I've such a list upon Olympus, here! It seems to be connected to your own, as several prophecies already are fulfilled. Isn't it such an honor to urge Fate along?
AthenaLowHealth05|Athena Low Health 05|Athena|Oh, Zagreus... your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped. Nevertheless, always strive onward, while you still draw breath.
AthenaLowHealth05|Athena Low Health 05|Athena|Oh, Zagreus... your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped. Nevertheless, always strive onward, while you still draw breath.
AthenaMaxRelationship01|Athena Max Relationship 01|Athena|Supporting you through your ordeal, Cousin? It's reminiscent of the thrill of doing battle by the side of those whom I hold dear. I may be safe upon our mountaintop, though I am with you there, as well... for every well-earned victory, and bitter loss.
AthenaHasWeapon01|Athena Has Weapon 01|Athena|You brandish the Eternal Spear we call Varatha...! So then it wasn't lost during the war. A magnificent weapon, in deserving hands.
AthenaHasWeapon02|Athena Has Weapon 02|Athena|Why, you wield Coronacht the Heart-Seeker...! I never took you for an archer, though the power of that bow is undeniable. Use it wisely!
AthenaHasWeapon03|Athena Has Weapon 03|Athena|You bear Aegis, the original itself...! My own shield was forged much later, in its image. You'll have to tell me someday how you found it.
AthenaHasWeapon04|Athena Has Weapon 04|Athena|You got your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists, I see. No ordinary weapon. Prone to fits of savagery quite unbecoming of a well-trained warrior. Then watch yourself, and throw not caution to the wind.
AthenaHasWeapon05|Athena Has Weapon 05|Athena|The Rail of Adamant, itself, has found its way into your hands, Cousin? A malignant thing, if you were to ask me, and not one I would ever use, myself. Unless, perhaps, I had no other choice. I suppose it must have been that way for you.
AthenaLowHealth01|Athena Low Health 01|Athena|You're badly injured aren't you, Cousin? I wish that I could will the pain away, though at the least I can provide you this.
AthenaLowHealth02|Athena Low Health 02|Athena|Look at you, Zagreus, you're barely fit to fight from all the injury that you've sustained! I'll try to keep you going for as long as possible.
AthenaLowHealth03|Athena Low Health 03|Athena|It seems to me that you've sustained life-draining injuries already, Zagreus. But don't lose hope. We can sustain you in a proper fighting shape.
AthenaLowHealth04|Athena Low Health 04|Athena|You may have suffered many wounds but shall not perish imminently, Cousin. Not if I have anything to say about it. Here.
AthenaLowHealth05|Athena Low Health 05|Athena|Oh, Zagreus... your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped. Nevertheless, always strive onward, while you still draw breath.
AthenaFirstPickUp|Athena First Pick Up|Zagreus|It's got to be her. Then, here goes nothing... *Ahem*. In the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.
AthenaFirstPickUp|Athena First Pick Up|Athena|Hail, noble Cousin. Now, let's get you from that miserable place. I'll see that all of us upon Olympus do our part, beginning here with me.
AthenaMiscPickup01|Athena Misc Pickup 01|Athena|Keep fighting, Cousin. Fight from out of that eternal gloom. I trust that you'll be joining us upon Olympus shortly.
AthenaMiscPickup02|Athena Misc Pickup 02|Athena|I have your back, Cousin. Rise now to your rightful station with my blessings!
AthenaMiscPickup03|Athena Misc Pickup 03|Athena|May the light and fury of Olympus guide you from the dark, Cousin. I've a token of it for you here.
AthenaMiscPickup04|Athena Misc Pickup 04|Athena|Push forward, noble Cousin. I shall be keen to see you circumvent the perils that the Fates arranged for you this time.
AthenaMiscPickup05|Athena Misc Pickup 05|Athena|Vanquish all who stand against you, noble Cousin. I and your relatives upon Olympus shall assist you in so doing.
AthenaMiscPickup06|Athena Misc Pickup 06|Athena|Sometimes I think about what you've endured, to have been living in that loathsome squalor, Cousin. I swear, you'll have your justice.
AthenaMiscPickup07|Athena Misc Pickup 07|Athena|Do not fear your father's cruel legions, Cousin! Their lives are long since forfeit, and they cannot stand against one of your birthright, nor against my power.
AthenaMiscPickup08|Athena Misc Pickup 08|Athena|Yours is a brazen plan of action, Zagreus, and I admire it. The boldest strategy often prevails. Especially with my support.
AthenaMiscPickup09|Athena Misc Pickup 09|Athena|Take heart, Cousin; for you have found me even in the suffocating darkness of the Underworld. May my power be of some assistance.
AthenaMiscPickup10|Athena Misc Pickup 10|Athena|Your struggles have not gone unnoticed, Cousin, so take heart. Eternity awaits you once you finally break free.
AthenaMiscPickup11|Athena Misc Pickup 11|Athena|Here on Olympus is the opposite of everything about that lifeless squalor you reside in, Zagreus. Fight on and come to us!
AthenaMiscPickup12|Athena Misc Pickup 12|Athena|Cousin, I grow angry merely thinking of your situation. May what power I can offer be of service as you struggle towards your fate.
AthenaMiscPickup13|Athena Misc Pickup 13|Athena|Your father chose to sever ties with all of us, and stew alone within his land beneath the earth. But you are not beholden to his actions. Fight!
AthenaMiscPickup14|Athena Misc Pickup 14|Athena|Your labors make you stronger, noble Cousin. And, the blessings I now offer ought to make you stronger still.
AthenaMiscPickup15|Athena Misc Pickup 15|Athena|I've found you once again, dear Cousin, and my strength is yours; so much of it as I can send there to the bowels of the earth.
AthenaMiscPickup16|Athena Misc Pickup 16|Athena|I'm here again to lend to you my power, noble Cousin. Though your own strength of will is how you'll finally break free of that cruel place.
AthenaMiscPickup17|Athena Misc Pickup 17|Athena|I'm pleased to see your father's stubbornness is manifest in you as such determination, Zagreus. My blessing be with you.
AthenaMiscPickup18|Athena Misc Pickup 18|Athena|What wretched fools dare stand against you, Cousin? Punish them, so that they learn something they ought have learned in life.
AthenaMiscPickup19|Athena Misc Pickup 19|Athena|Hold fast to your resolve, Cousin, and climb on toward the surface. No matter how often your foothold falters, I am here.
AthenaMiscPickup20|Athena Misc Pickup 20|Athena|I shall not keep you, Zagreus, except to offer you some of my power to improve your chances of escape. Now quickly choose, and go.
AthenaMiscPickup19_B|Athena Misc Pickup 19 B|Athena|May wisdom and good fortune guide you toward the light of day this time, Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickup20_B|Athena Misc Pickup 20 B|Athena|The Underworld's wretched dead shall fear you yet, Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickup21|Athena Misc Pickup 21|Athena|Strength and wisdom guide you from the darkness, Zagreus.
AthenaMiscPickup22|Athena Misc Pickup 22|Athena|The low cunning of your lifeless enemies is not a match for your divine might.
AthenaMiscPickup23|Athena Misc Pickup 23|Athena|Remember I am always watching over you, dear Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickup24|Athena Misc Pickup 24|Athena|You'll have your justice in due course, Cousin. I promise you.
AthenaMiscPickup25|Athena Misc Pickup 25|Athena|The might and fury of Olympus courses through you, noble Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra01|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 01|Athena|I take it you've a plan in mind this time for how you're going to escape, don't you, Cousin?
AthenaMiscPickupExtra02|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 02|Athena|I shall not keep you, Zagreus, except to offer you my power to improve your chances of escape.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra03|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 03|Athena|Remain relentless in your effort, Zagreus. For perseverance is a quality we all possess.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra04|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 04|Athena|I and your family on Olympus all stand ready to support you in your efforts, noble Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra05|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 05|Athena|Remember, doubt and hesitancy are your real enemies, Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra06|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 06|Athena|I know that you are more than capable even without my power, Cousin. But just in case...
AthenaMiscPickupExtra07|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 07|Athena|Envision your success, and choose the means by which you shall achieve it, Zagreus.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra08|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 08|Athena|I shall not offer empty words, dear Cousin; I shall instead offer you this.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra09|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 09|Athena|With our ferocity combined, Cousin, what chances do your father's forces even have?
AthenaMiscPickupExtra10|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 10|Athena|My support alone is not enough to see you through this, Zagreus; but it certainly shall help.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra11|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 11|Athena|Your foes shall soon find it impossible to overcome your strength, combined with mine.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra12|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 12|Athena|I've every confidence that you shall imminently put my blessing to good use.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra13|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 13|Athena|Let not your sense of purpose waver, Zagreus. Visualize the outcome you desire.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra14|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 14|Athena|Make not the same mistake twice, and you shall always grow wiser, no matter what else.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra15|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 15|Athena|I shall do everything within my power to defend you from the perils of your journey, Zagreus.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra16|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 16|Athena|Take heed against your father's legions, Zagreus. And take also my power.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra17|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 17|Athena|Do not forget that changing strategy can be the key to victory, Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra18|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 18|Athena|I cannot glean the details of your predicament right now, Cousin. Though maybe this shall help.
AthenaMiscPickupExtra19|Athena Misc Pickup Extra 19|Athena|The might and honor of Olympus shield you against the darkness and the dead, Zagreus.
AthenaMiscPickupRare01|Athena Misc Pickup Rare 01|Athena|I take it having an impenetrable defense against your enemies may be of some use, Cousin?
AthenaMiscPickupRare02|Athena Misc Pickup Rare 02|Athena|I'm not in any mood to trifle with your father's nonsense this time, Zagreus. So, use this.
AthenaMiscPickupRare03|Athena Misc Pickup Rare 03|Athena|These are among the mightest defenses I can offer, Zagreus. Choose wisely, then.
AthenaMiscPickupRare04|Athena Misc Pickup Rare 04|Athena|I've readied several of my most potent blessings so your victory can be achieved, Cousin.
AthenaMiscPickupRare05|Athena Misc Pickup Rare 05|Athena|Observe, dear Cousin, for this time I offer you uncommonly superior protection.
AthenaLootBought01|Athena Loot Bought 01|Athena|It feels unseemly to make contact from that most-unpleasant boatman's stash of ill-gotten wares. Nonetheless, this was an opportunity.
AthenaLootBought02|Athena Loot Bought 02|Athena|You're difficult to track there in the depths, Cousin; though, the boatman Charon thankfully is proving of some help.
AthenaLootBought03|Athena Loot Bought 03|Athena|The river-boatman Charon is beholden to your father's realm, but seems agreeable enough, for a fair price.
AthenaLootBought04|Athena Loot Bought 04|Athena|A shrewd expenditure of wealth is sometimes all that stands between a victory and sore defeat, isn't that right, Cousin?
AthenaLootBought05|Athena Loot Bought 05|Athena|We cannot effectively communicate with Charon from Olympus, but he is amenable to certain trades, and seems unfettered by your father's influence.
AthenaRejection01|Athena Rejection 01|Athena|I thought we were on better terms, Cousin. I ask only for your cooperation, yet still you turn your back...?
AthenaRejection02|Athena Rejection 02|Athena|I'm disappointed you would spurn me like this, Cousin. Know that I retaliate not out of spite, but by necessity.
AthenaRejection03|Athena Rejection 03|Athena|You'd choose one of my relatives, instead of me...? Though I myself was first to contact you? Alas, I must respond to you in kind.
AthenaRejection04|Athena Rejection 04|Athena|Upon Olympus, I'm your closest confidant. You'd best remember this before you spurn me again.
AthenaRejection05|Athena Rejection 05|Athena|We Olympians, we are a prideful family, Cousin. You cannot simply choose a favorite without spurring one of us to wrath.
AthenaRejection06|Athena Rejection 06|Athena|I understand you've made your choice, Cousin. And I, in turn, now have my family's reputation to uphold.
AthenaRejection07|Athena Rejection 07|Athena|If you had given due consideration to this matter, then I doubt you would have chosen this outcome.
AthenaRejection08|Athena Rejection 08|Athena|No one in our family can avoid taking sides forever, Zagreus. But you can take the more sensible side, at least.
AthenaRejection09|Athena Rejection 09|Athena|A senseless, punishable choice. But if you wish to face the consequences, so be it.
AthenaRejection10|Athena Rejection 10|Athena|You could have avoided this outcome any number of ways, yet still you risk incurring my wrath.
AthenaRejection11|Athena Rejection 11|Athena|Are you testing the limits of my patience with you, Zagreus? Then, I shall test your limits, in turn.
AthenaRejection12|Athena Rejection 12|Athena|I knew there was a possibility that you would side against me once again, but your doing so never ceases to amaze, Cousin.
AthenaRejection13|Athena Rejection 13|Athena|If this is your idea of humor, Zagreus, then I shall make it clear to you again that I am unamused.
AthenaRejection14|Athena Rejection 14|Athena|I think we understand by now that when you test my patience, I shall test your ability to survive.
AthenaMakeUp01|Athena Make Up 01|Athena|*Oh*, let's continue on, already, Zagreus. There isn't any point in feuding, and there's much to do before your quest is done.
AthenaMakeUp02|Athena Make Up 02|Athena|Now then! I hope we can move past this little incident, and keep our focus on the task at hand.
AthenaMakeUp03|Athena Make Up 03|Athena|I'm satisfied we understand each other better, now, don't we. What do you say we carry on, and get you from this place?
AthenaMakeUp04|Athena Make Up 04|Athena|All is forgiven, Zagreus, and I take no offense. Exacting vengeance is just something we Olympians all do from time to time.
AthenaMakeUp05|Athena Make Up 05|Athena|I'd say I've bickered with you quite enough for now, Cousin. Let us continue down a more productive path.
AthenaMakeUp06|Athena Make Up 06|Athena|We've better things to do, I think, than fight amongst ourselves over a matter such as this.
AthenaMakeUp07|Athena Make Up 07|Athena|I would very much prefer to think we both know better than to let old grudges stew forever, Zagreus.
AthenaMakeUp08|Athena Make Up 08|Athena|You see I have my father's temper, Zagreus. I am able to keep it in check, though I expect you to do your part.
AthenaMakeUp09|Athena Make Up 09|Athena|Conflict between the members of our family is inevitable, Zagreus. All we can do is learn and grow from it.
AthenaMakeUp10|Athena Make Up 10|Athena|I see no benefit to staying angry, Cousin. I promised Nyx that I would help rather than hinder you.
AthenaMakeUp11|Athena Make Up 11|Athena|Your father also made some questionable choices, Zagreus. But all of us are family, after all.
AthenaGift01|Athena Gift 01|Zagreus|I'm indebted to you, Goddess, for all that you and your side of the family have done for me.
AthenaGift01|Athena Gift 01|Athena|Well it simply isn't in my nature to allow such offerings to go unanswered, noble Cousin. In turn, I wish for you to have this, with my compliments.
AthenaGift02|Athena Gift 02|Zagreus|For you, Lady Athena, without whom I would assuredly be lost.
AthenaGift02|Athena Gift 02|Athena|This is an unexpected gesture, Cousin! I do appreciate it, though please do not feel obliged. I offer you my friendship, not a loan to be repaid.
AthenaGift03|Athena Gift 03|Zagreus|I have a simple token for you, Goddess. Although it's insufficient thanks for all the aid you've given me.
AthenaGift03|Athena Gift 03|Athena|You are most gracious, Cousin, to extend this offering. You honor me, yet I would ask you think of your well-being for the time, not mine.
AthenaGift04|Athena Gift 04|Zagreus|Goddess Athena, please accept this gift. Your wisdom ever guides me toward the light.
AthenaGift04|Athena Gift 04|Athena|My, how very generous of you, to offer me this gift! I'm very grateful, though I ask that you not go out of your way on my account. Let's please stay focused, here?
AthenaGift05A|Athena Gift 05 A|Zagreus|As I remain committed to my task, Goddess, I'm reminded none of this would have been possible without your aid. And so, I must give thanks, even if through a meager offering.
AthenaGift05A|Athena Gift 05 A|Athena|I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus. But I would ask that you save it for when your task is complete. You've more important matters to attend to now!
AthenaGift05B|Athena Gift 05 B|Zagreus|As I remain committed to my task, Goddess, I'm reminded none of this would have been possible without your aid. And so, I must give thanks, even if through a meager offering.
AthenaGift05B|Athena Gift 05 B|Athena|I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus. But I would ask that you save it for a better time. You've more important matters to attend to, now!
AthenaGift06|Athena Gift 06|Zagreus|Lady Athena, I know there's more at stake for you in this than just my plight... you care so much about this family. That care and your determination spurs me on. I'm ever grateful.
AthenaGift06|Athena Gift 06|Athena|Perhaps there really is no time quite like the present when it comes to showing thanks to one another, my dear Cousin. You've opened my eyes to the possibility, though I remain steadfast in my resolve to fight for you.
AthenaGift07|Athena Gift 07|Zagreus|I know this Ambrosia originated on Olympus, Lady Athena. Though through its long voyage to these depths, I trust its savor is more worthy of your grace. No one's ever had a greater cousin. And I'll never forget what you've done for me.
AthenaGift07|Athena Gift 07|Athena|Zagreus? When Nyx revealed herself to me and I first learned of you, I saw it as an opportunity to bridge the great divide between Olympus and your father's realm. But, having had all these glimpses into who you are, it is an even greater honor to have forged this partnership with you.
PoseidonWithZeus01|Duo - Poseidon and Zeus (1)|Poseidon|Now, little Hades, you have met my brother Zeus! He's sometimes known as king of all the gods! Although, in many ways, he's not as powerful as I! Nor anywhere as dashing. Why, I, *oop*--!
PoseidonWithZeus01|Duo - Poseidon and Zeus (1)|Zeus|Now, Brother... you know better than to say such things about me, I should think. I know that tact does not come easily to you, though I'd be careful what you say to our good nephew, there.
PoseidonWithZeus01|Duo - Poseidon and Zeus (1)|Poseidon|*Buh*, *erm*, anyway, as I was saying, little Hades! Brother Zeus is king of all the gods! And the most dashing, powerful, and hey, let's face it, *godliest *of all!
PoseidonWithAthena01|Duo - Poseidon and Athena (1)|Poseidon|As you can see by now, we are a big and clever family, little Hades! My niece Athena here being the cleverest of all. You'd never know that she was childless, the way she looks after and cares for all of us!
PoseidonWithAthena01|Duo - Poseidon and Athena (1)|Athena|Surely my cleverness comes from your brother and yourself, Lord Uncle Poseidon. And I would only add, my feeling is we've more than enough children in this family, thus no further need for more of them, for now.
PoseidonWithAres01|Duo - Poseidon and Ares (1)|Poseidon|Now, little Hades, you must know by now I've other nephews here, don't you? For instance, Ares comes to mind, the god of war! Some mighty wars have taken place at sea, is that not so?
PoseidonWithAres01|Duo - Poseidon and Ares (1)|Ares|Indeed, they have, good Uncle Poseidon. Mortals show great ingenuity when war is concerned; it drives their sense of progress, more than anything at all. Perhaps someday they shall wage war even in Father's skies.
PoseidonWithArtemis01|Duo - Poseidon and Artemis (1)|Poseidon|The thing about me, Nephew, is I get along with everybody, here! A skill apparently that's rather rare! Take my niece Artemis, for instance! Can't ever take a simple jest, at all! You won't easily attract a mate with such a sour look about you, girl!
PoseidonWithArtemis01|Duo - Poseidon and Artemis (1)|Artemis|Oh, and wouldn't that be such a pity, Uncle Poseidon. I wonder what could be the cause of this sour look that I perpetually have up here? Maybe Zagreus knows.
PoseidonWithArtemis01|Duo - Poseidon and Artemis (1)|Poseidon|*Hahaha*! See exactly what I mean, Nephew?
PoseidonWithDemeter01|Duo - Poseidon and Demeter (1)|Poseidon|My foster-sister Goddess Demeter, despite her stern approach, she often likes to make good sport of me, Nephew! Why, here she is right now!
PoseidonWithDemeter01|Duo - Poseidon and Demeter (1)|Demeter|If you're quite finished blathering, Poseidon, our young Zagreus has more important things to do. He needs your blessings, not your point of view. Don't you, young sprout?
PoseidonBeatTheseusQuestComplete|Poseidon Beat Theseus Quest Complete|Poseidon|*Ah-haha*! I knew that I could count on you, Nephew! So the ungrateful Theseus, the winsome prize he earned was just some chariot, correct? And he was vanquished on it, anyway! That's what he gets! Boasting his prize was greater than any in his mortal days, *pah*!
PoseidonFishQuestComplete|Poseidon Fish Quest Complete|Poseidon|*Ah-haha-hah*, little Hades, I was certain you'd the wherewithal to thin the ranks of the betraying river denizens who fled my surface-seas to your father's domain!! I bid you good fish-hunting forevermore!
PoseidonAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Poseidon About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|All right, here goes. In the name of Hades! Olympus! This is an official message! Uncle Poseidon, hope you can make this out.
PoseidonAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Poseidon About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Poseidon|What's this, Nephew? Why, isn't this a note? Or, part of one, addressed to me, but it appears there should be other pieces, for the others here? *Ah*, it's like a sunken treasure, then! Which means I must seek its mysteries at once!
PoseidonPostEpilogue01|Poseidon Post Epilogue 01|Poseidon|You know, Nephew, I had a positively raucous time down there, with your old father, and Persephone, was she a sight! I never thought I'd see *her *again! So then, we're one big happy family, at last! But you've a job to do, and we upon Olympus, we'll do our fair share!
PoseidonAboutZeus01|Poseidon About Zeus 01|Poseidon|So, Nephew, my honored brother Zeus already has endowed you with his thunderous might? Well you shall soon forget about all that, after a taste of *this*!
PoseidonAboutAthena01|Poseidon About Athena 01|Poseidon|*Ahh*, you've received a blessing from Athena there already, little Hades! So careful all the time, that one, but here, I'll help you live a little, just in case!
PoseidonAboutAphrodite01|Poseidon About Aphrodite 01|Poseidon|*Oh-hoh*, so you've already heard from Aphrodite, have you, Nephew? Understandable, but first things first, now let me add a little something to all that!
PoseidonAboutAres01|Poseidon About Ares 01|Poseidon|Hoy, Nephew! It's my understanding you've been blessed already by one of my *other *nephews, Ares! As you can see, not all of us are cut from the same cloth; and thank the Fates for that!
PoseidonAboutArtemis01|Poseidon About Artemis 01|Poseidon|I sense that you've been marked by the elusive Artemis, correct, Nephew? She shies away from most of us, so if she's taken somewhat of a liking to you, great!
PoseidonAboutDionysus01|Poseidon About Dionysus 01|Poseidon|Whenever Dionysus calls a feast, I'm turning up sooner or later, hear me, Nephew? So make room for one more blessing, and, let's go!
PoseidonAboutHermes01|Poseidon About Hermes 01|Poseidon|Little Hades, it appears that you are moving right along! Almost at an uncanny pace!! I wonder how you got to be so fast! Aquatic exercise?!
PoseidonAboutHermes02|Poseidon About Hermes 02|Poseidon|Nephew, how is it you're navigating your cruel father's realm at such a blinding speed?! There's only one Olympian who moves that quick! Besides myself! Where is he, anyway?
PoseidonAboutDemeter01|Poseidon About Demeter 01|Poseidon|Why, little Hades, there's a certain chill about you, meaning you received an ice-cold blessing courtesy of Elder Goddess Demeter, correct? Now, personally, I think water's best in liquid form, but who am I to judge?
PoseidonVsZeus01|Poseidon Vs Zeus 01|Poseidon|You've come to know your Uncle Zeus, by now, correct? Just want to let you know, good Zeus gets very busy on the regular, so you just stick with me, I've always time for you, Nephew!
PoseidonBackstory01|Poseidon Backstory 01|Poseidon|Nephew, your cruel father, Hades, he's my elder brother, you know that? Not exactly the expressive type, and never was. We seldomly saw eye-to-eye on things!
PoseidonBackstory02|Poseidon Backstory 02|Poseidon|I daresay, little Hades, you've some spunk in you! Why, I think you take after me more than my crusty elder brother! You'll get away from that old codger yet!
PoseidonBackstory03|Poseidon Backstory 03|Poseidon|My crusty elder brother Hades must have tried to poison you against us lot! I can imagine it as clear as water, Nephew! I'm proud that you've resisted his undoubtedly most-twisted words!
PoseidonBackstory04|Poseidon Backstory 04|Poseidon|Last time your father and I spoke, he told me I was all washed up, can you believe the nerve of it, Nephew? Why, he took the words right out of my mouth!
PoseidonAboutPowers01|Poseidon About Powers 01|Poseidon|It's likely, little Hades, that you currently reside just underneath one of my boundless seas! Normally you'd have to be submerged to use this power, but you know what, close enough!
PoseidonHighRelationship01|Poseidon High Relationship 01|Poseidon|You know I've many vitally important things to do besides lending my aid to you repeatedly, Nephew? But, all of that can wait! Family comes first!
PoseidonMaxRelationship01|Poseidon Max Relationship 01|Poseidon|If you should ever make it here, Nephew, know this! I shall be pleased to stand in for the father figure I can tell you never really had. We can engage in all sorts of aquatic competitions, solve riddles, visit the sea-nymphs! Oh, it would be great, wouldn't you think?
PoseidonAboutSeas01|Poseidon About Seas 01|Poseidon|Nephew, why, the seas up here, they're just about as widely feared as your vast Underworld down there! For water can be deadlier than bronze!
PoseidonAboutSeas02|Poseidon About Seas 02|Poseidon|My oceans, they are filled with danger, not just water, little Hades! Many of the dead you face, they met their mortal end at sea, and not on land!
PoseidonVsMeg01|Poseidon Vs Meg 01|Poseidon|*Ahh*, it seems to me you've had yourself a spot of lady trouble, lately, isn't that correct, Nephew? I mean the Fury down in Tartarus, of course! You going to let her keep on bossing you around?!
PoseidonVsMeg02|Poseidon Vs Meg 02|Poseidon|*Hah*! I heard you showed that good-for-nothing Fury after all, I knew you'd handle that old crone, Nephew! And if she troubles you again, you just remind her who's in charge down there!
PoseidonRunProgress01|Poseidon Run Progress 01|Poseidon|Good tidings, Nephew! I've learned that you have managed to get all the way to Asphodel, fine work! Now, you just keep on going!
PoseidonRunProgress02|Poseidon Run Progress 02|Poseidon|*Ohh*, Nephew, you've stood against the Bull of Minos, have you? Well I must apologize for any inconvenience there, because, he was a living testament to my revenge! Long story, boring really, rather sordid, too. Stay strong!
PoseidonRunProgress03|Poseidon Run Progress 03|Poseidon|Word reaches us that you've come very far, indeed, Nephew! Striking distance from the surface! You just keep at it like that, and with our help, we'll have you out of there for sure!
PoseidonRunProgress04|Poseidon Run Progress 04|Poseidon|I wonder what monstrosities await you near the surface, little Hades? There's your father's terrifying hell-hound, for one thing! Ah, well, I'm sure you'll find a way to sail past whatever's in your way!
PoseidonRunProgress05|Poseidon Run Progress 05|Poseidon|Now don't lose heart, Nephew! Because in spite of all your efforts, it is probably the case that you still have a long and painful road ahead!
PoseidonRunCleared01|Poseidon Run Cleared 01|Poseidon|*Ah*, I thought for certain you were well on your way out of there last time, Nephew! But, no matter, we'll just get you on another voyage to the top!
PoseidonRunCleared02|Poseidon Run Cleared 02|Poseidon|Little Nephew, why, I could have sworn you made it to the surface recently, and yet, you're all the way back there, again? Must be some sort of terrible monstrosity preventing your way out!
PoseidonPostEpilogue02|Poseidon Post Epilogue 02|Poseidon|I'll tell you, Nephew, I was quite taken aback to learn Persephone, she was your mother all along! Just disappeared up here, one day! Ran off, I figured, as she's got some mortal blood in her. But she was with your father! That rascal is my brother, after all!
PoseidonPostEpilogue03|Poseidon Post Epilogue 03|Poseidon|So how is crusty old Hades faring down there of late, Nephew? Fewer worries there upon his brow? That Underworld of yours all running smoothly, and all that? We'll keep on pitching in from over here. Least we can do!
PoseidonPostEpilogue04|Poseidon Post Epilogue 04|Poseidon|Persephone, she says you're really stuck down there, born of the Underworld, something like that? Well, if you ask me, that's no kind of attitude to have! You can do *anything *you set your mind to, Nephew! Take it from me!
PoseidonPostEpilogue05|Poseidon Post Epilogue 05|Poseidon|If you *do *ever get the opportunity to spend some time up here, Nephew, know I shall take you on a grand tour of the surface! From the depths of my seas to the height of Olympus! Sure, maybe not today, or tomorrow, or even the next aeon! But sometime, we should go!
PoseidonPostEpilogue06|Poseidon Post Epilogue 06|Poseidon|Been nice to see my brothers getting on again, just like old times! Well, not exactly like old times, and come to think of it, there always was a bit of tension there between those two, but still! It's better than before!
PoseidonAboutPersephoneVisit01|Poseidon About Persephone Visit 01|Poseidon|Your good mother Persephone, she's here all safe and sound, thought you should know, there, little Hades! Shame you can't be here with her, too, but *ah*! Doubtless we'll someday meet again!
PoseidonAboutKeepsake01|Poseidon About Keepsake 01|Poseidon|Ah-*hah*! I sense you have in your possession that fine shell I sent to you, a little gift plucked straight out of the sea! You keep it close so I can better track you down!
PoseidonHasWeapon01|Poseidon Has Weapon 01|Poseidon|My, my, little Hades, you brandish Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! That weapon's power was so terrifying that we sealed it away. Oh well! Surely its mortal-damning secrets shall be safely guarded in your hands!
PoseidonAboutFistWeapon01|Poseidon About Fist Weapon 01|Poseidon|Huh! Why, if my eyes do not deceive me through those murky depths, you brandish *Malphon*! Let me tell you, little Hades, those old gloves have done some dirty work before your time!
PoseidonHasWeaponUpgrade01|Poseidon Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Poseidon|Why, little Hades, it is awful murky where you are, but if I'm not mistaken, and I never am, you wield fearsome Stygius! She once belonged to me, you know! Not quite my type, but we sure had our times! You take good care of her for me!
PoseidonAboutHadesAspect01|Poseidon About Hades Aspect 01|Poseidon|Say, is it me, or do you bear your father's ancient spear, Nephew? I always wanted one a bit like that. And now I have one even better. *Hah*!
PoseidonLowHealth05|Poseidon Low Health 05|Poseidon|Your hated enemies, they almost got the best of you, I fear! But you can still turn it around, especially now that you have my aid!
PoseidonLowHealth05|Poseidon Low Health 05|Poseidon|Your hated enemies, they almost got the best of you, I fear! But you can still turn it around, especially now that you have my aid!
PoseidonAboutTheseus01|Poseidon About Theseus 01|Poseidon|Say, word has reached me that you squared against one known as Theseus, now champion there in Elysium? He was a handful even when he lived! So much so that my honored brother Zeus, he took to calling him my son, can you believe the nerve?
PoseidonAboutTheseus02|Poseidon About Theseus 02|Poseidon|So, little Hades, doubtless you have seen that we upon Olympus also lend our favor to the mighty Theseus, who bars your passage from Elysium! Now, don't you take it personally, there, because our blessings go to *all *who deserve them. Although, we try to save the best for you!
PoseidonBeatTheseusQuest01|Poseidon Beat Theseus Quest 01|Poseidon|That scoundrel Theseus! Apparently he earned himself some sort of winsome prize, for all his blustering there in Elysium! Though, I'm quite certain that, no matter what he and his bull friend have at their disposal, you've the power to defeat them, utterly! So go do it, surely I'll get word!
PoseidonAboutFishing01|Poseidon About Fishing 01|Poseidon|Why, Nephew, you've procured the Rod of Fishing, I detect! Fine handiwork if I say so myself! Its line is nigh-invisible and causes denizens of my domain to flock to it like mortals to temples of mine! Good fortune with that thing!
PoseidonAboutFishing02|Poseidon About Fishing 02|Poseidon|I'm told a number of the underwater denizens from my domain were captured fair-and-square through your surpassing skill using the Rod of Fishing, little Hades!! They're yours, I've millions more!
PoseidonAboutFishing03|Poseidon About Fishing 03|Poseidon|All these river denizens you've caught, little Hades... it can only mean we share a deep connection, don't you think? I, with my power over the entire vastness of the seas! And you, with the power to ensnare a hapless fish with but a flick of the wrist!
PoseidonAboutGuanYuAspect01|Poseidon About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Poseidon|Say, what exactly is that very mighty-looking spear I think I faintly see in your possession there, it's... why, I've not seen a thing like that except on very distant shores! It's almost as impressive as my trident here! *Almost*, I say!
PoseidonAboutArthurAspect01|Poseidon About Arthur Aspect 01|Poseidon|You bear some sort of splendid-looking weapon, there, Nephew! Must be another aspect of fair Stygius, my old discarded blade! Never did see that one myself, but, I saw many others that were splendid, too!
PoseidonLowHealth01|Poseidon Low Health 01|Poseidon|*Hoh*, you look positively in atrocious shape, there, Nephew! What's the matter, one too many run-ins with the wretched dead before *I *intervened?
PoseidonLowHealth02|Poseidon Low Health 02|Poseidon|Seems to me that you're in dire straits, there, little Hades! Why, you're bleeding everywhere! Here, let me try and do something for that.
PoseidonLowHealth03|Poseidon Low Health 03|Poseidon|*Ah*, what happened to you, little Hades?! I can tell even from here that you've been beaten like a skiff during a storm!
PoseidonLowHealth04|Poseidon Low Health 04|Poseidon|Now, don't go dying on me, yet, Nephew! You have to *live*! Or else the Boon I offer you shall go to waste!
PoseidonLowHealth05|Poseidon Low Health 05|Poseidon|Your hated enemies, they almost got the best of you, I fear! But you can still turn it around, especially now that you have my aid!
PoseidonFirstPickUp|Poseidon First Pick Up|Zagreus|It's uncle number two, it's got to be. Then, in the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.
PoseidonFirstPickUp|Poseidon First Pick Up|Poseidon|Hoy there, little Hades! You recognize your uncle, do you not? We've a lot of catching up to do, but first things first, you get yourself out of that dour Underworld! As for me, I'll see if I can *stir *things up a bit to cover your advance!
PoseidonMiscPickup01|Poseidon Misc Pickup 01|Poseidon|Hoy, Nephew, it's excellent to see you once again, and in good spirits, still? Then, come, let's make some waves!
PoseidonMiscPickup02|Poseidon Misc Pickup 02|Poseidon|Ahoy, little Hades, it is I! The greatest of your uncles! Here to aid you in your daringest escape attempt! And I do admire your persistence!
PoseidonMiscPickup03|Poseidon Misc Pickup 03|Poseidon|Good tidings once again, there, little Nephew!! It is I, returned as ever here to make a splash against your many, many foolish enemies!
PoseidonMiscPickup04|Poseidon Misc Pickup 04|Poseidon|Ahoy, Nephew! I bet you have your hands full dealing with your enemies down there, so let me see what I can do. And I can do a lot!
PoseidonMiscPickup05|Poseidon Misc Pickup 05|Poseidon|It seems you're getting somewhere, little Nephew! Good, but here, allow your favorite Uncle to bestow a little boost!
PoseidonMiscPickup06|Poseidon Misc Pickup 06|Poseidon|*Ah, hahaha! *Found you down there, Nephew! Now let's overwhelm your enemies in a typhoon of godly might, what do you say?
PoseidonMiscPickup07|Poseidon Misc Pickup 07|Poseidon|Little Hades, have I ever told you I detest the dead? Well, I admit it, I just cannot stand a mortal past his due. So how about we get you far away from all such filth, agreed?
PoseidonMiscPickup08|Poseidon Misc Pickup 08|Poseidon|What do you say, there, Nephew, ready to get wet, or no? Oh I suspect you are, so let's get to it, and dispense some liquid justice!
PoseidonMiscPickup09|Poseidon Misc Pickup 09|Poseidon|How fares your feud against my crusty elder brother lately, good? Big Hades, he is disagreeable with all of us, not just with you, so, don't you take it personal, and stick with me!
PoseidonMiscPickup10|Poseidon Misc Pickup 10|Poseidon|Looks like *you *could use the power of the sea, wouldn't you say so, little Hades? Good thing I'm here, so that together, we might wash your enemies away!
PoseidonMiscPickup11|Poseidon Misc Pickup 11|Poseidon|Enough kidding around without me, Nephew! I am here, so let's go bust you out, much like a raging river through a frail little dam!
PoseidonMiscPickup12|Poseidon Misc Pickup 12|Poseidon|You're looking somewhat stronger than before, there, little Nephew, but you're much too scrawny still, to be quite blunt. So, here! Let's fatten you right up!
PoseidonMiscPickup13|Poseidon Misc Pickup 13|Poseidon|*Hoy*, my nephew! I think I have kept you waiting long enough, so then, let's *go*! And break our enemies to pieces, like so many ships upon the shoals!
PoseidonMiscPickup14|Poseidon Misc Pickup 14|Poseidon|I'll have you know, the power of the seas themselves is yours once more, Nephew! So how about you put it to its rightful purpose, and go smash some stuff!
PoseidonMiscPickup15|Poseidon Misc Pickup 15|Poseidon|Are you perchance in need of godlike aid, Nephew? Well, excellent! Because I happen to command the sea, and I shall hereby let you take it for a whirl!
PoseidonMiscPickup16|Poseidon Misc Pickup 16|Poseidon|Who dares to mess with little Hades? You simply point me at them, Nephew, and we'll leave them shivering and sopping wet, you'll see!
PoseidonMiscPickup17|Poseidon Misc Pickup 17|Poseidon|At last I found you once again, Nephew! You eating well and getting strong, correct? I'll help you with the latter category in a moment. Here!
PoseidonMiscPickup18|Poseidon Misc Pickup 18|Poseidon|The awesome bounty of the sea is yours to do with as you please, Nephew! I've mustered forth a sample, anyway!
PoseidonMiscPickup19|Poseidon Misc Pickup 19|Poseidon|Hoh, little Hades! I'd heard you were preparing to rain terrible destruction on your enemies! So I got here as quickly as I could! I'm not too late, am I?
PoseidonMiscPickup20|Poseidon Misc Pickup 20|Poseidon|All of us must sail through troubled waters now and then, correct, Nephew? Fortunately, navigation is my speciality, so let's be on our way!
PoseidonMiscPickup21|Poseidon Misc Pickup 21|Poseidon|Your victory's most certainly at hand now that I'm here, Nephew! So long as you make sure to take advantage of the absolutely awesome power I bequeath!
PoseidonMiscPickup23|Poseidon Misc Pickup 23|Poseidon|Why, if it isn't the most favored of my nephews, stuck as ever though you may yet be! We'll get you from there, little Hades, don't despair, Uncle Poseidon's here!!
PoseidonMiscPickup24|Poseidon Misc Pickup 24|Poseidon|Good tidings, my most favored nephew! All is relatively well, I hope? But hope alone is worthless without action, is it not? So here, let's act *together*!
PoseidonMiscPickup25|Poseidon Misc Pickup 25|Poseidon|Just wait until you see the seas, Nephew! My underwater realm is the most glorious of the world's habitats. It positively teems with life, and it's much cooler there than in that sweaty Underworld of yours!
PoseidonMiscPickup26|Poseidon Misc Pickup 26|Poseidon|Well, Nephew, supposing it's high time for the high seas to lend their might once more?
PoseidonMiscPickup27|Poseidon Misc Pickup 27|Poseidon|Your uncle's offering to shake things up once more, what say you, little Hades?
PoseidonMiscPickup28|Poseidon Misc Pickup 28|Poseidon|No more dallying about, now, little Nephew! Time instead we really got somewhere!
PoseidonMiscPickup29|Poseidon Misc Pickup 29|Poseidon|Good tidings, little Hades! It is I! And I am always here to help!
PoseidonMiscPickup30|Poseidon Misc Pickup 30|Poseidon|Fear not, Nephew, it is I, your uncle! Come to wash away your troubles, here and now!
PoseidonMiscPickup31|Poseidon Misc Pickup 31|Poseidon|Just point me toward your enemies, Nephew, and they'll become sworn enemies of mine!
PoseidonMiscPickup32|Poseidon Misc Pickup 32|Poseidon|Let's get you out from underneath the sea, there, little Nephew!
PoseidonMiscPickup33|Poseidon Misc Pickup 33|Poseidon|Ahoy, my godly Nephew, I've arrived, so set aside your worries and let's drench the dead!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra01|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 01|Poseidon|How about we set you up here with some real *water*-power, little Hades?
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra02|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 02|Poseidon|I take it you could use some liquid courage at this time, no, little Hades?
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra03|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 03|Poseidon|How about a swim, there, little Hades? A swim, that is, within the Pool of Blessings! Now, dive in!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra04|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 04|Poseidon|I'm here, Nephew, to aid you in your time of need, with *this*!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra05|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 05|Poseidon|I heard that you could use the awesome power of the sea, Nephew!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra06|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 06|Poseidon|Go on and make a splash for me, why don't you, little Hades!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra07|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 07|Poseidon|The treasures of the sea are limitless, so here! You take your pick!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra08|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 08|Poseidon|What do you say we make some waves, right, little Hades?
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra09|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 09|Poseidon|Don't let the wretched dead dampen your spirits, little Hades! Dampen *theirs*!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra10|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 10|Poseidon|Here comes another cool, refreshing blessing for you, Nephew!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra11|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 11|Poseidon|Water can even cut through solid stone, with enough time! So you keep at it, there!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra12|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 12|Poseidon|I know that you can do it, little Hades! Whatever it may be!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra13|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 13|Poseidon|It's darker than the bottom of the sea in there! Are you alive, Nephew?!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra14|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 14|Poseidon|The secrets of the sea can all be yours! Eventually at least, I have just three for now!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra15|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 15|Poseidon|You still alive down there, Nephew? Because if so, why, this ought to keep it that way!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra16|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 16|Poseidon|Must get so stuffy in that dreary place, Nephew! So why don't you cool off a bit, with *this*!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra17|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 17|Poseidon|You have a dirty job down there, Nephew, but I can help you to clean up a bit!
PoseidonMiscPickupExtra18|Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 18|Poseidon|All that I ask, here, little Nephew, is for you to do your best! As I would do!
PoseidonMiscPickupRare01|Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 01|Poseidon|Ahoy, and now prepare yourself! For I've a rare treat here, especially for you!
PoseidonMiscPickupRare02|Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 02|Poseidon|I am ever impressed with your will to succeed, Nephew, so here! Great blessings be with you!
PoseidonMiscPickupRare03|Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 03|Poseidon|You've earned only the very finest of my blessings, little Hades! Why? Why *not*!
PoseidonMiscPickupRare04|Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 04|Poseidon|If you are ever going to get out of there, only the mightiest of all my blessings will suffice!
PoseidonMiscPickupRare05|Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 05|Poseidon|My favorite Nephew ought have access to my greatest blessings, should he not?
PoseidonLootBought01|Poseidon Loot Bought 01|Poseidon|Ah-*hah*! You found me, little Nephew! Strewn among the inventories of that most disturbing river-boatman! That means you win my blessing!
PoseidonLootBought02|Poseidon Loot Bought 02|Poseidon|Well, well, my plan to get ahold of you via the boatman worked out flawlessly! Harness the might of the sea, then, why don't you?
PoseidonLootBought03|Poseidon Loot Bought 03|Poseidon|Well, Nephew, I know that salty Charon can be difficult. But I am certain that whatever price you paid, you got a *deal*!
PoseidonLootBought04|Poseidon Loot Bought 04|Poseidon|Nothing comes freely for the mortals on the surface, Nephew! And from the sound of things, it isn't any different with that Charon character!
PoseidonLootBought05|Poseidon Loot Bought 05|Poseidon|Let me just say, Nephew, that money-hoarding boatman best be fair with you! Because I'd hate to see anything happen to that little boat of his!
PoseidonRejection01|Poseidon Rejection 01|Poseidon|*Whaaaa*, you think that you've a chance in hell without my help, am I to understand?! You made a big mistake there, little Hades, just you watch.
PoseidonRejection02|Poseidon Rejection 02|Poseidon|How bold of you to throw your lot in with my relatives instead of me, given the choice, there, little Hades. But don't you ever bet against *this *horse!
PoseidonRejection03|Poseidon Rejection 03|Poseidon|Oh, now, it seems to me your strength outweighs your smarts, there, Nephew, if you're prone to picking other sides than mine!
PoseidonRejection04|Poseidon Rejection 04|Poseidon|A word of caution, little Nephew: Never turn your back against the sea. And, while you're at it, never take up sides against your greatest uncle!
PoseidonRejection05|Poseidon Rejection 05|Poseidon|*Augh*! I'm absolutely flabbergasted, Nephew!! I offer you the finest blessings of the earth and sea, and they're not good enough?
PoseidonRejection06|Poseidon Rejection 06|Poseidon|Apparently my crusty elder brother failed to teach you any manners, if you deign to thusly spurn my offerings! But I can teach you yet!
PoseidonRejection07|Poseidon Rejection 07|Poseidon|*Betrayal*, little Hades!! Of all my nephews, you should know better than this! Or perhaps I should. One of us, at least!
PoseidonRejection08|Poseidon Rejection 08|Poseidon|That's definitely not the choice *I *would have made, Nephew! Because, for me to side against myself, why, that would make no sense at all!
PoseidonRejection09|Poseidon Rejection 09|Poseidon|Nephew, what you have just done is tantamount to spitting in my face! Let me remind you, then, the ocean can spit back!
PoseidonRejection10|Poseidon Rejection 10|Poseidon|You wound me, little Hades, with your callous choice! It's fortunate I'm quite impervious to harm. But I don't think the same is true for you!
PoseidonRejection11|Poseidon Rejection 11|Poseidon|You know the saying not to play with fire, don't you, Nephew? You'll find the same is very much the case with water, too!
PoseidonRejection12|Poseidon Rejection 12|Poseidon|Again, you would defy me, little Hades? I'm beginning to see why your father might be very frustrated, indeed, having to deal with you!
PoseidonRejection13|Poseidon Rejection 13|Poseidon|It seems that you require yet one more gentle reminder not to scoff at chances to accept my blessings, little Hades! Now remember this!
PoseidonRejection14|Poseidon Rejection 14|Poseidon|Sometimes I think, surely my nephew takes to heart my strongly worded threats about my distaste for his little acts of treachery, but *no*!
PoseidonRejection15|Poseidon Rejection 15|Poseidon|I could have sworn I told you never to take the power of the sea for granted, little Hades? It seems the time for words is over, then!
PoseidonMakeUp01|Poseidon Make Up 01|Poseidon|Oh, very well then, little Hades! Uncle's going to let you off the hook this time. Just mind your manners next we meet!
PoseidonMakeUp02|Poseidon Make Up 02|Poseidon|I must hand it to you, little Hades! I did not expect that you would weather such a storm! I'm mightily impressed!
PoseidonMakeUp03|Poseidon Make Up 03|Poseidon|Ah, I can't stay angry! Let us call all that unpleasantness back there water under the bridge, what say you, Nephew?
PoseidonMakeUp04|Poseidon Make Up 04|Poseidon|My, a show of strength like that deserves a commendation I should think! Although, for next time, know my favor's not a thing to trifle with!
PoseidonMakeUp05|Poseidon Make Up 05|Poseidon|All right, that's quite enough, I take it you have had about enough of that, correct? You're pretty good! So here, why don't you run along!
PoseidonMakeUp06|Poseidon Make Up 06|Poseidon|Oh, *hoh-hoh*, you've got some fire in you, don't you, little Hades? Here! I've just the thing to cool you down, fresh from my own domain!
PoseidonMakeUp06|Poseidon Make Up 06|Poseidon|*Ah-haha*, my fits of anger come and go just like the tides, Nephew! Now take this from me, and get out of here!
PoseidonMakeUp07|Poseidon Make Up 07|Poseidon|Now that was truly finely fought, indeed, Nephew! And I've a suitable reward here, just for you! Don't even know what I was mad about!
PoseidonMakeUp08|Poseidon Make Up 08|Poseidon|What can I say, Nephew? Sometimes our tempers get the best of all of us. You're fortunate mine didn't get the best of you back there!
PoseidonMakeUp09|Poseidon Make Up 09|Poseidon|You weathered the storm, there, little Hades, and the sea is once again at peace. And you'll make every attempt to keep it that way, correct?
PoseidonMakeUp10|Poseidon Make Up 10|Poseidon|All right, no need to fight about this any longer, don't you think, Nephew? Here, take my blessing, like you should have in the first place!
PoseidonMakeUp11|Poseidon Make Up 11|Poseidon|Now let's not set a bad example for the family, Nephew! We're better than all that. Besides! They've many bad examples as it is.
PoseidonGift01|Poseidon Gift 01|Zagreus|Uncle Poseidon, it's been excellent to know you, sir, so, please, this is for you.
PoseidonGift01|Poseidon Gift 01|Poseidon|Oh I am positively moved by your affection, little Nephew! Though, I think I have just the thing for you, in turn! Here, I shall transfer it to you!!
PoseidonGift02|Poseidon Gift 02|Zagreus|Uncle Poseidon, this here is for you. Would that my father were as easygoing as yourself.
PoseidonGift02|Poseidon Gift 02|Poseidon|*Ah-hah*! A show of generosity from my most favored nephew! Your gift is mightily appreciated!! I'll just go ahead and add it to the pile.
PoseidonGift03|Poseidon Gift 03|Zagreus|Mighty Poseidon, greatest of my uncles, arguably, please accept this gift!
PoseidonGift03|Poseidon Gift 03|Poseidon|For all the times I'm offered gifts or sacrifices, little Nephew, I still always very much appreciate it! I mean, look! I'm grinning ear to ear!
PoseidonGift04|Poseidon Gift 04|Zagreus|Uncle Poseidon, I have a special catch for you! Although it pales next to your sheer awesomeness.
PoseidonGift04|Poseidon Gift 04|Poseidon|*Whaaa*, now would you look at that! Is that an offering to your most favored uncle, *me*? You know what, Nephew? I've decided I shall take it! Thanks!!
PoseidonGift05|Poseidon Gift 05|Zagreus|I salute you, Uncle Poseidon! Your strength and confidence inspire me, and you accepted me as part of the family without question. It means a lot.
PoseidonGift05|Poseidon Gift 05|Poseidon|*Ahh*, Nephew, but you needn't shower me with offerings and praise, you know! Why, I've no need of showering at all! Not when I've the sea itself, to do with as I please!
PoseidonGift06|Poseidon Gift 06|Zagreus|Whenever I encounter you, Uncle Poseidon, my spirits lift, and I feel there must not be anything that can stop me. I only wish we met sooner, though I'm grateful to have met you at all.
PoseidonGift06|Poseidon Gift 06|Poseidon|I thought I told you, Nephew, not to make such offerings to me? Ah, probably forgot! Or getting you mixed up, perhaps, for I have many other nephews, thanks to Zeus! Though, between us, I don't like any one of them as much as you!
PoseidonGift07|Poseidon Gift 07|Zagreus|Uncle Poseidon, sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like had you been a part of it sooner. Your encouragement, your enthusiasm... it means a lot. To you! This Ambrosia's been to hell and back!
PoseidonGift07|Poseidon Gift 07|Poseidon|*Hohhh*, but isn't this a kingly offering, indeed, my little Hades! I know how difficult it must have been to get, so distant from Olympus as you are! I'll never understand how come your father's cruel to you, for if you were my son, I would be proud! Proud anyway, but you get the idea.
DemeterWithZeus01|Duo - Demeter and Zeus (1)|Demeter|Well, now, young sprout, you've met the so-called King of the Olympians, and I. Whom do you now suppose is genuinely ruler of this snow-encrusted mountaintop of ours?
DemeterWithZeus01|Duo - Demeter and Zeus (1)|Zeus|Oh, *hah-hah-hah*, Lady Demeter! Your wit is just as dry as the earth lying quite fallow in your care! Perhaps you should go tend to that again, though let's we go ahead and help our young man first!
DemeterWithPoseidon01|Duo - Demeter and Poseidon (1)|Demeter|Ah, little sprout. I was just notifying Lord Poseidon here that all of his domain exists because it pleases me; remember, my good foster-brother, I could freeze your oceans solid if I chose.
DemeterWithPoseidon01|Duo - Demeter and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|*Ah, hahahah! *Excellently stated, venerable Goddess Demeter! I'm reminded once more of your vast experience, though, I think we all prefer our oceans liquidy, isn't that right, Nephew?!
DemeterWithAthena01|Duo - Demeter and Athena (1)|Demeter|To think, young sprout, our strategist Athena, warrior-goddess, sprang from Zeus' head! I would expect that no high intellect could come from there.
DemeterWithAthena01|Duo - Demeter and Athena (1)|Athena|Please do not mind the Lady Demeter's good-natured sense of humor, Zagreus. She and my father often like to jest with one another, even in the most difficult times.
DemeterWithAres01|Duo - Demeter and Ares (1)|Demeter|Young Zagreus, once you arrive, do tell Lord Ares here that his great power's not worth anything without my own. Wars have their causes, among which, many I control.
DemeterWithAres01|Duo - Demeter and Ares (1)|Ares|I do not question that your influence can stir a mortal's impulses toward war, O Goddess Demeter. At least we can agree that our domains are quite compatible!
DemeterWithAphrodite01|Duo - Demeter and Aphrodite (1)|Demeter|Remember something for us, Zagreus. A frozen heart holds no sway over anyone at all. Isn't that right, oh Aphrodite, dear?
DemeterWithAphrodite01|Duo - Demeter and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|Oh, I don't know, my dearest Demeter! The frozen heart has tendency to thaw, and then begin to beat with renewed vigor after that. I trust your time shall come! It can never be too late, except for mortals, the poor things.
DemeterWithArtemis|Duo - Demeter and Artemis ()|Demeter|Why, Zagreus, my gentle Artemis here was just saying how concerned she was for your predicament! I'm sure she'd like it if we both could help you in this case.
DemeterWithArtemis|Duo - Demeter and Artemis ()|Artemis|Concerned? I don't see anyone concerned, you have this, Zagreus! You don't need anybody's help, and you can get through this all on your own, though just in case, and I mean just in case! Um, here.
DemeterWithDionysus01|Duo - Demeter and Dionysus (1)|Demeter|The crops shall wither and decay so long as I may please, young Zagreus. Although we do have those upon Olympus who take issue with my reasoning...
DemeterWithDionysus01|Duo - Demeter and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|*Erm*, yeah, milady, I take issue here! I mean how are the grapes supposed to grow and wine supposed to flow when you are so uptight, now, just ease up a little there, let's see what we can do!
DemeterAboutZeus01|Demeter About Zeus 01|Demeter|I see the noble King of the Olympians has reached you prior to me, Zagreus. I wonder which of all his many lies he's told you last.
DemeterAboutPersephone01|Demeter About Persephone 01|Demeter|My foster-brother's wayward son appears! I, too, once lost a child, Zagreus. I was quite foolish with her from the start. Her father was a baseborn farm-boy; worshiped me! He's gone as well, of course. Only the cold remains.
DemeterAboutPersephone02|Demeter About Persephone 02|Demeter|My daughter to a baseborn farm-boy, she... why, little sprout, I wasn't very kind to her, I think. Certainly not once her father passed. It was her mortal blood that made her weak! Born to mortals, taken by mortals, I suspect. So now, they *pay*.
DemeterAboutPersephone03|Demeter About Persephone 03|Demeter|I don't suppose... no, it is nothing, little sprout, it's just... I hear such wicked rumors now and then, about my daughter, lost to me, and what became of her. Kore, we called her, then. Persephone is what she called herself. Before she vanished utterly, leaving no trace....
DemeterAboutPersephone04|Demeter About Persephone 04|Demeter|After my daughter Kore disappeared, I left this mountaintop. Wandered the earth, in search. For naught, of course. It was a necessary journey, I suppose. May yours fare better.
DemeterAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Demeter About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Hope Mother knows what she's doing, in the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lady Demeter, this is for you.
DemeterAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Demeter About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Demeter|What's all of this, young Zagreus, a message of some sort, for me, indeed? I... can't decipher it, although... it bears the marks of my two foster-brothers here, and... well! It seems we'd better compare notes!
DemeterPostEpilogue01|Demeter Post Epilogue 01|Demeter|Why, little sprout, young Zagreus... my grandson! I can scarce believe it, still! To think that, Kore, or... Persephone, my daughter... she had been with Foster-Brother Hades, all this time! A match I wouldn't have expected... or approved. That's why she left! Our blasted hearts do what they want.
DemeterLiftsWinterCurse01|Demeter Lifts Winter Curse 01|Demeter|My little grandson, little sprout, I've thought... if my Persephone's alive, why then... this winter, hasn't it endured for long enough...? It's grown to have a certain stubbornness, but I... I am the goddess of the seasons, Zagreus. Perhaps it's time I changed them once again.
DemeterLiftsWinterCurse02|Demeter Lifts Winter Curse 02|Demeter|I've lifted the cold from the earth, much as I said I would, grandson. But, near your father's realm... I have decided it shall stay the way it is. Bereft of warmth. As a reminder to us all, about all this.
DemeterAboutPoseidon01|Demeter About Poseidon 01|Demeter|You bear the blessing of Poseidon, Zagreus? Someday I shall remind him of his place, and freeze his watery domain entirely.
DemeterAboutAthena01|Demeter About Athena 01|Demeter|Athena has imparted you her *wisdom*, Zagreus? A simulacrum of the real thing, at any rate. True wisdom only comes with age, I think.
DemeterAboutAphrodite01|Demeter About Aphrodite 01|Demeter|All of the love and beauty in the world can wither in a season, Zagreus. Remember that when next the goddess Aphrodite makes her promises.
DemeterAboutAres01|Demeter About Ares 01|Demeter|Lord Ares already got hold of you, has he? He's good at making mortals kill each other, yes. But he has utterly no knack for subtlety.
DemeterAboutArtemis01|Demeter About Artemis 01|Demeter|The gentle Artemis already found you, Zagreus? She takes my orders well; one cannot blame her, for she'd have nothing to hunt if not for me.
DemeterAboutDionysus01|Demeter About Dionysus 01|Demeter|You stumbled into Dionysus, Zagreus? One of these days I shall prevent his vineyards all from ripening; put to the test his carefree attitude.
DemeterAboutChaos01|Demeter About Chaos 01|Demeter|The mark of Chaos is upon you, isn't it? A force older than I! Yet one which you ought not trust so readily. No rhyme or reason to that one at all.
DemeterAboutPom01|Demeter About Pom 01|Demeter|Is that the bloodlike stain of pomegranate on you, Zagreus? A hardy fruit resistant to a winter's chill. How fascinating they survive, down there.
DemeterLegendaryPickUp01|Demeter Legendary Pick Up 01|Demeter|I don't often divulge such blessings as I am about to, Zagreus. Don't thank me for it, but make certain that you use my power well.
DemeterLegendaryPickUp02|Demeter Legendary Pick Up 02|Demeter|I have affection for you, little sprout. No need for reciprocity, but now I'll offer you the fiercest of my capabilities.
DemeterPostGiftPickup01|Demeter Post Gift Pickup 01|Demeter|I must admit I have grown fond of you, young sprout; nevertheless, I shall not spoil you like some ill-mannered child.
DemeterPostGiftPickup02|Demeter Post Gift Pickup 02|Demeter|My, but you're as determined as my foster-brothers were, when my sisters and I stood with them 'gainst the Titans way back when.
DemeterAboutLoss01|Demeter About Loss 01|Demeter|Our family, why, I think we understand something of loss, now, don't we, Zagreus? Unlike the mortals on the surface. Always begging me for plenty. They'll get none. But as for you, I have a plethora to offer!
DemeterAboutLoss02|Demeter About Loss 02|Demeter|You are entirely too young to have had meaningful experience with loss, young Zagreus. Pray to me that you never have to learn.
DemeterAboutSurface01|Demeter About Surface 01|Demeter|You live within the bosom of the earth, and know its warmth. But there is no such warmth up here, young Zagreus. You truly wish to feel the bitter cold of the outside? Then, here.
DemeterAboutSurface02|Demeter About Surface 02|Demeter|Someday, you'll gain the surface, Zagreus; and you shall see firsthand what mortalkind has wrought. You'll find it has some commonality with your domain.
DemeterAboutMotherhood01|Demeter About Motherhood 01|Demeter|Motherhood's a curse, young Zagreus. Be thankful you're immune. You sprang from Nyx herself, or so I hear? I sprang from Theia, whoever she was. And I once bore a child, too. Long gone. A mother's work... isn't it such a waste?
DemeterAboutHades01|Demeter About Hades 01|Demeter|Your father Hades and I share a common fate, each having lost a child fully grown; except that he's a hollow fool, whose child left! Whereas my daughter never would have. Ever!
DemeterAboutHades02|Demeter About Hades 02|Demeter|Your father always had a sternness to him that his brothers lacked. Thought him a decent sort, comparatively anyway; though evidently he is no such thing.
DemeterAboutLove01|Demeter About Love 01|Demeter|Should you achieve your goal, and see this surface-world, Zagreus, I've but one bit of knowledge to impart: Don't ever fall for mortals. Use them if you must, but do not waste your love on those who waste away.
DemeterAboutHelios01|Demeter About Helios 01|Demeter|I have a brother, Helios, the Sun. A nonsense-talker with a flaming chariot. Why, he once told me that my Kore, that she went into that Underworld of yours! Preposterous. The clouds now blot him out entirely.
DemeterAboutHelios02|Demeter About Helios 02|Demeter|This land is not unlike your own in certain ways. For, Helios the Sun has not shone down upon it for some time. How long, I really couldn't tell you, little sprout! Long enough for mortals to take notice, certainly.
DemeterAboutSisters01|Demeter About Sisters 01|Demeter|My sisters Hestia and Hera surely would assist as well, young sprout. Except they and our foster-brothers haven't been getting along of late. Though as for me? I'll never leave this mountaintop of mine.
DemeterAboutFather01|Demeter About Father 01|Demeter|We all are willful children, are we not? I'm daughter to Hyperion, you know; a Titan so obscure and hated that Lord Zeus, he started calling me his birth-sister, so much did he dislike this bit of truth! And to get a rise out of me, too.
DemeterAboutFather02|Demeter About Father 02|Demeter|As seasons give to one another, so do generations, I suppose. Hyperion, my father? He'd not a one redeeming quality. My sisters and my foster-brothers and myself; this world owes us a debt for ridding it of him and his kind.
DemeterAboutZeus02|Demeter About Zeus 02|Demeter|I ought to warn you that my foster-brother Zeus, he has just a *disgusting *sense of humor, little sprout. He'd have you think he sired half the countryside! I have to shudder at the very thought.
DemeterAboutRumors01|Demeter About Rumors 01|Demeter|There's so much nonsense that the mortals say to one another of our family, Zagreus. How viciously the rumors spread! Whether from that oaf, Zeus, or likely from the mortal drunkard-poets with no better use of their limited time!
DemeterHighAffinity01|Demeter High Affinity 01|Demeter|I warn you, Zagreus, best not to make attempts to grow much closer with me, thus. I'm much your elder, after all, and you're my little sprout. What say we keep it that way, hm?
DemeterHighAffinity02|Demeter High Affinity 02|Demeter|I... I am so very moved, I... have a daughter once again. And... I've a grandson, too! I thought, I felt something when first I met you, but... I brushed it off. Just like a fleck of snow...
DemeterRunCleared01|Demeter Run Cleared 01|Demeter|Someday, my little sprout, you'll gain the surface of your father's realm, and see my handiwork. Until such time, I'll come to your aid as I can. It's quite the entertaining pastime, honestly!
DemeterPostEpilogue02|Demeter Post Epilogue 02|Demeter|By the way, we had entirely a lovely time within your father's house, Grandson. And, to see Kore once again, it... warmed my heart. I'm beyond grateful that your mother's safe. And that you've an important job to do. Here, I shall help.
DemeterPostEpilogue03|Demeter Post Epilogue 03|Demeter|I meant to tell you something, Grandson... you needn't have deceived the rest of us. You could have sent word that my daughter was with you down there, all along! Ah, but families are a complicated thing. Just swear that you'll be candid with us, next time.
DemeterPostEpilogue04|Demeter Post Epilogue 04|Demeter|You must visit us sometime up here, Grandson! I understand the surface hasn't been agreeable with you... though perhaps if not in this age, then the next, we shall have you over. It's brisk up here... but nice enough, I think.
DemeterPostEpilogue05|Demeter Post Epilogue 05|Demeter|Young sprout, I cannot fully understand my daughter's choices, such as what she saw in your gloom-filled father to have eloped with him. But if you are the result, then she is clearly wiser than I estimated.
DemeterPostEpilogue06|Demeter Post Epilogue 06|Demeter|I made mistakes raising your mother, sprout. When she was my Kore. I was blind to the possibility that she could have left me, but... I see it now. If you become a parent yourself, someday... may you listen more than I.
DemeterPostEpilogue07|Demeter Post Epilogue 07|Demeter|You tell my Kore... *erm, Persephone*, that is... the Queen! You tell her that her mother sends her warm regards. You tell her that. And you take care of her.
DemeterPostEpilogue08|Demeter Post Epilogue 08|Demeter|Grandson, my daughter Queen Persephone, she sent me the most precious message, courtesy of Hermes, as of late. I'm pleased to hear that you are getting on all right. Though, I know you're at work, so here!
DemeterAboutKeepsake01|Demeter About Keepsake 01|Demeter|The Frostbitten Horn which you bear once overflowed. It holds a certain power still, of course. But never again shall mortalkind take it for granted.
DemeterAboutPact01|Demeter About Pact 01|Demeter|The heat has risen quite considerably there, is that not so? Then if my foster-brother's tampered with the temperature, I'll have to cool things off.
DemeterAboutAsphodel01|Demeter About Asphodel 01|Demeter|The heat of your surroundings must be difficult to bear, my little sprout. It's fortunate I've just the thing for that.
DemeterAboutStyx01|Demeter About Styx 01|Demeter|That chill sensation I detect must indicate that you are near the surface, Zagreus. If you can overcome the final challenges ahead, you soon shall see the long winter yourself.
DemeterHasWeapon01|Demeter Has Weapon 01|Demeter|That's Sister Hera's Heart-Seeker you have! The very weapon which she used to put our predecessors down. It hasn't lost its potency I see. Fear not, I shall not mention this to her, if I see her.
DemeterHasWeapon02|Demeter Has Weapon 02|Demeter|Why, isn't that there Sister Hestia's oddly constructed armament you bear? She always was so predisposed to flame; I thought she'd never give it up! If it's to be in any hands, then may as well be yours.
DemeterHasWeapon03|Demeter Has Weapon 03|Demeter|I scarcely can see... are those the Twin Fists that you bear, young sprout? I once made ample use of them myself, if you'll imagine it. Wielding the cold since has been adequate for me, but you? May you put them to work as I once did.
DemeterLowHealth01|Demeter Low Health 01|Demeter|Why, you've the look of one who has endured a terribly long winter, Zagreus! I trust you'll cling to life a little longer, now.
DemeterLowHealth02|Demeter Low Health 02|Demeter|I sense your grip on life is coming loose, young Zagreus. Now turn that cold you feel against your enemies.
DemeterLowHealth03|Demeter Low Health 03|Demeter|You seem to be in dire need of some assistance, Zagreus. I think perhaps I have a bit to spare.
DemeterLowHealth04|Demeter Low Health 04|Demeter|You're in the winter of your current stretch of life, aren't you, Zagreus? Do try and live a little longer for me, hm?
DemeterLowHealth05|Demeter Low Health 05|Demeter|You waste away just like a common mortal, Zagreus. How rather unbecoming of a god.
DemeterLowHealth06|Demeter Low Health 06|Demeter|The flame of life is easily extinguished by the cold, young Zagreus. Surely you feel the warmth within you giving way?
DemeterLowHealth07|Demeter Low Health 07|Demeter|Cold comfort for your terrible predicament, young Zagreus, but I am here.
DemeterFirstPickUp|Demeter First Pick Up|Zagreus|Last time I felt a chill like this was... on the surface, but, who...? Well, one way to find out. Then, in the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message!
DemeterFirstPickUp|Demeter First Pick Up|Demeter|I understand, young Zagreus, that you would seek to leave that bitter darkness for this bitter cold? Quite honestly I fail to see why. But I'll aid your plight, why not? For I can offer plenty of assistance, and you soon shall grow fond of it, I think.
DemeterMiscPickup01|Demeter Misc Pickup 01|Demeter|I once had plentitudes of blessings I would offer readily, young Zagreus; but I am feeling not as generous of late.
DemeterMiscPickup02|Demeter Misc Pickup 02|Demeter|Did you detect perhaps a certain spirit-shaking chill within the air, young Zagreus?
DemeterMiscPickup03|Demeter Misc Pickup 03|Demeter|Plenty of blessings left to go around; although, only for you, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup04|Demeter Misc Pickup 04|Demeter|Your enemies shall have no shelter from the cold whilst I am at your side, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup05|Demeter Misc Pickup 05|Demeter|There's something to the barrenness, where you reside; perhaps someday it shall be more like that up here.
DemeterMiscPickup06|Demeter Misc Pickup 06|Demeter|Your realm there is much like the wind-swept surface here. Mostly devoid of life, such as it's been of late.
DemeterMiscPickup07|Demeter Misc Pickup 07|Demeter|Olympus must seem like a distant paradise to you, young Zagreus; it is a frozen waste to me. But still, it's home.
DemeterMiscPickup08|Demeter Misc Pickup 08|Demeter|Your foes shall more than catch cold by the time we're through, don't you agree, young sprout?
DemeterMiscPickup09|Demeter Misc Pickup 09|Demeter|All those who stand opposed to you, why, we shall shatter more than their resolve, I think, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup10|Demeter Misc Pickup 10|Demeter|One of these seasons I suppose I ought to double-check the mortals haven't gone extinct without my intervention at each step.
DemeterMiscPickup11|Demeter Misc Pickup 11|Demeter|None can endure an everlasting winter's chill, young Zagreus; not even your father's lifeless servants there beneath the earth.
DemeterMiscPickup12|Demeter Misc Pickup 12|Demeter|The seasons have a certain beauty to them, I suppose. Though struggle onward, and you needn't take my word for it.
DemeterMiscPickup13|Demeter Misc Pickup 13|Demeter|I've known your father and his brothers here for many seasons now; they bicker endlessly with me and one another.
DemeterMiscPickup14|Demeter Misc Pickup 14|Demeter|I have to tell you something, little sprout. I take cold comfort knowing that my foster-brother Hades is no better at his parenting than I.
DemeterMiscPickup15|Demeter Misc Pickup 15|Demeter|I'd gladly scour all your father's realm if doing so would free you from his clutches, Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup16|Demeter Misc Pickup 16|Demeter|I'll have you know something, young Zagreus: The bitter cold and frost is just as inescapable as death itself.
DemeterMiscPickup17|Demeter Misc Pickup 17|Demeter|The seasons turn relentlessly, without regard, and thusly should you doggedly push forward on your path.
DemeterMiscPickup18|Demeter Misc Pickup 18|Demeter|I shall bring desolation upon those who wrong you, little sprout.
DemeterMiscPickup19|Demeter Misc Pickup 19|Demeter|I hope that you're aware how seldomly I give my blessing as of late, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup20|Demeter Misc Pickup 20|Demeter|There's no escaping from the bitter cold, you know.
DemeterMiscPickup21|Demeter Misc Pickup 21|Demeter|Your adversaries soon shall know something of loss, I think.
DemeterMiscPickup22|Demeter Misc Pickup 22|Demeter|Let us see to it your foes are left with nothing.
DemeterMiscPickup23|Demeter Misc Pickup 23|Demeter|There shall be only souls for harvesting this day, I think, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup24|Demeter Misc Pickup 24|Demeter|My warm regards, and all my blessings to you, little sprout.
DemeterMiscPickup25|Demeter Misc Pickup 25|Demeter|The bitterness of cold and death go hand in hand, I do suppose.
DemeterMiscPickup26|Demeter Misc Pickup 26|Demeter|When all is taken away, the cold yet remains, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup27|Demeter Misc Pickup 27|Demeter|I am not feeling quite so generous of late, young Zagreus, but nevertheless: Choose.
DemeterMiscPickup28|Demeter Misc Pickup 28|Demeter|Your lifeless foes must foolishly believe they've nothing left to lose.
DemeterMiscPickup29|Demeter Misc Pickup 29|Demeter|Go with my blessings, Zagreus; though you may take but one.
DemeterMiscPickup30|Demeter Misc Pickup 30|Demeter|Decay is the inevitable state of things; we are merely helping it along.
DemeterMiscPickup31|Demeter Misc Pickup 31|Demeter|The cold of Mount Olympus shall bring utter ruin on your enemies.
DemeterMiscPickup32|Demeter Misc Pickup 32|Demeter|Death and cold, they are irrevocably bound together, Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup33|Demeter Misc Pickup 33|Demeter|The climate in those depths needs cooling, then, I take it, Zagreus?
DemeterMiscPickup34|Demeter Misc Pickup 34|Demeter|You bring with you the season of decay, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup35|Demeter Misc Pickup 35|Demeter|Your foes shall all wither before you like unwatered crops.
DemeterMiscPickup36|Demeter Misc Pickup 36|Demeter|The frost eventually shall cover everything, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup37|Demeter Misc Pickup 37|Demeter|You'll find that life gives way quite easily to cold, young sprout.
DemeterMiscPickup38|Demeter Misc Pickup 38|Demeter|Look carefully upon my blessings, Zagreus, and take no more than one.
DemeterMiscPickup39|Demeter Misc Pickup 39|Demeter|I trust that harvesting dead souls is not unlike the harvest we have on the surface, Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup40|Demeter Misc Pickup 40|Demeter|You're like a little flame there in your father's realm; easy enough to spot.
DemeterMiscPickup41|Demeter Misc Pickup 41|Demeter|It seems to me your foes are ripe for harvesting, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickup42|Demeter Misc Pickup 42|Demeter|Any who stand against you soon shall wither from the cold, young sprout.
DemeterMiscRarePickup01|Demeter Misc Rare Pickup 01|Demeter|I seldom feel too generous of late, and yet for you, young Zagreus? Why not.
DemeterMiscRarePickup02|Demeter Misc Rare Pickup 02|Demeter|I once offered the mortals generosities as this in much more copious supply.
DemeterMiscRarePickup03|Demeter Misc Rare Pickup 03|Demeter|It soon shall be exceptionally cold down in the Underworld, I think.
DemeterMiscRarePickup04|Demeter Misc Rare Pickup 04|Demeter|I'd never give out blessings such as this to merely anyone, I hope you know.
DemeterMiscRarePickup05|Demeter Misc Rare Pickup 05|Demeter|I've quite the harvest here from which to choose, my little sprout.
DemeterMiscRarePickup06|Demeter Misc Rare Pickup 06|Demeter|Soon, the season there shall turn exceptionally cold, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscRarePickup07|Demeter Misc Rare Pickup 07|Demeter|It is particularly cold outside, today; and soon it shall be so in there for you.
DemeterMiscPickupAboutWinter01|Demeter Misc Pickup About Winter 01|Demeter|Well, my little sprout, we shall have to get you through this winter's cold.
DemeterMiscPickupAboutWinter02|Demeter Misc Pickup About Winter 02|Demeter|A crisp and pleasant winter's evening to you, Zagreus; now, here.
DemeterMiscPickupAboutWinter03|Demeter Misc Pickup About Winter 03|Demeter|My finest winter blessings to you, little sprout.
DemeterMiscPickupExtra01|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 01|Demeter|Well, Grandson, it's growing rather cold, don't you agree?
DemeterMiscPickupExtra02|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 02|Demeter|I'm here to ease some of your burdens, my young sprout. That's what we grandmothers are for.
DemeterMiscPickupExtra03|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 03|Demeter|I trust you're keeping yourself warm enough in all of this, Grandson?
DemeterMiscPickupExtra04|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 04|Demeter|When all this is over, please do come and visit us sometime, Grandson.
DemeterMiscPickupExtra05|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 05|Demeter|I'd tell you not to work too hard, Grandson, although your family is in need of more hard-working sorts.
DemeterMiscPickupExtra06|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 06|Demeter|Foul weather's on the forecast for your foes, Grandson.
DemeterMiscPickupExtra07|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 07|Demeter|Don't let my foster-brother bully you about, you hear, Grandson?
DemeterMiscPickupExtra08|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 08|Demeter|Let's cool down that hot head of yours a bit, why don't we, Grandson?
DemeterMiscPickupExtra09|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 09|Demeter|My best regards to Queen Persephone and your lord father, little sprout. You keep it up.
DemeterMiscPickupExtra10|Demeter Misc Pickup Extra 10|Demeter|I trust your mother Queen Persephone is faring well if she has as fine a son as you, young Zagreus.
DemeterMiscPickupPersephoneAway01|Demeter Misc Pickup Persephone Away 01|Demeter|Your mother sends you all her love from Mount Olympus, Grandson.
DemeterMiscPickupPersephoneAway02|Demeter Misc Pickup Persephone Away 02|Demeter|All the best from Queen Persephone, young sprout. She misses you, you know.
DemeterMiscPickupPersephoneAway03|Demeter Misc Pickup Persephone Away 03|Demeter|Persephone is doing well here on Olympus, Zagreus. You ought to visit, too, sometime.
DemeterLootBought01|Demeter Loot Bought 01|Demeter|Be thankful that the rivers to your realm have not yet frozen over, Zagreus.
DemeterLootBought02|Demeter Loot Bought 02|Demeter|I trust your ferry-boatman Charon has no qualms about the freezing temperatures up here?
DemeterLootBought03|Demeter Loot Bought 03|Demeter|My message comes to you by river-boat this time, young Zagreus. At least that Charon is amenable to our attempts to contact you.
DemeterRejection01|Demeter Rejection 01|Demeter|My blessing's seldom given and ought not be so readily refused, young Zagreus.
DemeterRejection02|Demeter Rejection 02|Demeter|I am accustomed to such disrespect from all those blasted mortals, Zagreus, but *you*?
DemeterRejection03|Demeter Rejection 03|Demeter|If you are so disinterested in my generosity, young Zagreus, then you shall have my wrath.
DemeterRejection04|Demeter Rejection 04|Demeter|I don't recall if I yet warned against this type of attitude, although it doesn't matter either way.
DemeterRejection05|Demeter Rejection 05|Demeter|Do you believe I give my blessings liberally, Zagreus? Well then I've news for you.
DemeterRejection06|Demeter Rejection 06|Demeter|Offend me, and I'll drain the last traces of color from those cheeks of yours.
DemeterRejection07|Demeter Rejection 07|Demeter|That was an ill-advised decision, Zagreus. I'm past quickly forgiving such mistakes.
DemeterRejection08|Demeter Rejection 08|Demeter|You truly think you can withstand the ravages of winter, Zagreus? That I would like to see.
DemeterRejection09|Demeter Rejection 09|Demeter|A harsh winter is coming for you, Zagreus. And I'm afraid you've brought it on yourself.
DemeterRejection10|Demeter Rejection 10|Demeter|For that decision, Zagreus, it is about to be a very cold day down there in your Underworld.
DemeterRejection11|Demeter Rejection 11|Demeter|A careless choice you've made, there, Zagreus. As you grow long in years, perhaps you shall learn better judgment as to whom to trust, and whom to never, ever disrespect.
DemeterMakeUp01|Demeter Make Up 01|Demeter|Perhaps you'll exercise more wisdom in such interactions moving forward, hm?
DemeterMakeUp02|Demeter Make Up 02|Demeter|It ultimately isn't my intent to leave you in the cold like this, young Zagreus.
DemeterMakeUp03|Demeter Make Up 03|Demeter|The freezing cold ought to have drained the life from you; but I've allowed it to relent, for now.
DemeterMakeUp04|Demeter Make Up 04|Demeter|Next time, young Zagreus, perhaps I'll take every last bit of warmth you've left down there.
DemeterMakeUp05|Demeter Make Up 05|Demeter|I am the eldest of Olympus, Zagreus. And I expect for you to treat me suitably.
DemeterMakeUp06|Demeter Make Up 06|Demeter|The harsh of winter's gone for now, young Zagreus; and so take heart, but also you take heed.
DemeterMakeUp07|Demeter Make Up 07|Demeter|So you survived a little winter's chill, didn't you, there? Be careful, though; next season could be worse.
DemeterMakeUp08|Demeter Make Up 08|Demeter|Remember, next time, Zagreus, that on my whim I can take everything from you.
DemeterMakeUp09|Demeter Make Up 09|Demeter|I am quite capable of making your life plenty difficult, you do now realize, young Zagreus?
DemeterMakeUp10|Demeter Make Up 10|Demeter|Perhaps a few more winter seasons such as that might teach you more of how this world works.
DemeterMakeUp11|Demeter Make Up 11|Demeter|Enough; I do not hold to grudges, Zagreus. You've my good graces, and my temper's cooled, for now.
DemeterGift01|Demeter Gift 01|Zagreus|Good Lady Demeter, you've shown me warmth and generosity, and I am very grateful for it. Please, accept this as a small token of my appreciation.
DemeterGift01|Demeter Gift 01|Demeter|An offering well suited for the season, there, young Zagreus! In turn, as you are honorable and obedient, you'll have from me what the mortals have not.
DemeterGift02|Demeter Gift 02|Zagreus|A little offering for you, good Lady Demeter. I'm deeply grateful for your willingness to aid me in all this.
DemeterGift02|Demeter Gift 02|Demeter|I must acknowledge and accept your thoughtful gift of Nectar, Zagreus; would that the mortals showed deference thus.
DemeterGift03|Demeter Gift 03|Zagreus|May this small offering bring you some joy there on Olympus, Lady Demeter. Thank you for all your help.
DemeterGift03|Demeter Gift 03|Demeter|A conscientious gift, my little sprout; and I am grateful for your generosity. A bit of Nectar cuts straight through the cold, I say.
DemeterGift04|Demeter Gift 04|Zagreus|Your power and your wisdom has been of such help, good Lady Demeter. I'm honored, and this is the least I can do in exchange.
DemeterGift04|Demeter Gift 04|Demeter|I was quite certain that the youth today was lacking any sort of tactfulness, young Zagreus. For once I'm thankful to be proven wrong.
DemeterGift05|Demeter Gift 05|Zagreus|Lady Demeter, I am forever in your debt for the affection that you've shown to me, and for the power you've bestowed.
DemeterGift05|Demeter Gift 05|Demeter|The everlasting winter means that Nectar's been in rather short supply; that you would think of *me *for such an offering is duly noted, then.
DemeterGift06|Demeter Gift 06|Zagreus|I often remember that there's sweetness in this world only by your grace, Lady Demeter. I'm thankful that we've grown closer through all this.
DemeterGift06|Demeter Gift 06|Demeter|You would make further offerings to me? Even though I have made quite clear I've lately not been at my charitable best, young Zagreus? You're either naive or you're much too kind, or both.

HermesBackstory05|Hermes Backstory 05|Hermes|Know that saying *'don't be hasty'*, boss? That comes from me. I swear! A little way to stave off competition, masquerading as the wisdom of a sage. Those stupid mortals will buy anything!
HermesBackstory06|Hermes Backstory 06|Hermes|Not that I really know *exactly *what you're up to, Coz, but! If I did, I don't think anybody on Olympus is aware of it. Or, if they are, they're keeping their mouths shut. The same as me!

HermesAboutSkelly02|Hermes About Skelly 02|Hermes|Boss, I know you've heard a certain rumor from a very skinny individual who's uninclined to move. You best keep that one to yourself, all right? Or else our jig is up, and your father wouldn't like that, nor would you. So, cheers!

HermesMiscPickup32|Hermes Misc Pickup 32|Hermes|Special delivery and all that, boss! Here, take your pick.
HermesMiscPickup33|Hermes Misc Pickup 33|Hermes|Hey boss! You take one of these, and go for it.
HermesMiscPickup34|Hermes Misc Pickup 34|Hermes|Just so happened to be in the area, here, boss!
HermesMiscPickup35|Hermes Misc Pickup 35|Hermes|Making sure you got this, Coz. You got this, Coz!
HermesMiscPickup36|Hermes Misc Pickup 36|Hermes|Here comes a little boost to get you up and out of there in no time, boss!
HermesMiscPickup37|Hermes Misc Pickup 37|Hermes|Now, don't just stand there, Coz, pick one of these and *go*!
HermesMiscPickup38|Hermes Misc Pickup 38|Hermes|Your quickness is my number one priority, here, boss.
HermesMiscPickup39|Hermes Misc Pickup 39|Hermes|No time to waste and so on, Coz. Now, choose!
HermesMiscPickup40|Hermes Misc Pickup 40|Hermes|Caught wind you need my services here, boss?
HermesMiscPickup41|Hermes Misc Pickup 41|Hermes|Thought I'd check in, Coz. See how things are going. Slow, right? Not for long.
HermesMiscPickup42|Hermes Misc Pickup 42|Hermes|Ready to hustle? Good! I'll take that as a yes.
HermesMiscPickup43|Hermes Misc Pickup 43|Hermes|Let's get you quickly on your way, there, Coz!
HermesMiscPickup44|Hermes Misc Pickup 44|Hermes|Message for you, boss. It says: *'Here, choose one of these, and go!'*
HermesMiscPickup45|Hermes Misc Pickup 45|Hermes|Another message for you! This one says: *'Hey boss! Take this!'*
HermesMiscPickup46|Hermes Misc Pickup 46|Hermes|Just thought I'd check up on you, boss, and bring you this!
HermesMiscPickup47|Hermes Misc Pickup 47|Hermes|Hope you enjoyed the life of being slow, because all that's about to change, right here!
HermesMiscPickup48|Hermes Misc Pickup 48|Hermes|All right, boss, here, let's get you on your way!
HermesMiscPickup49|Hermes Misc Pickup 49|Hermes|Past time we got you out of there, right, boss?
HermesMiscPickup50|Hermes Misc Pickup 50|Hermes|Just thought I'd drop by, give you this, and go!
HermesMiscPickup51|Hermes Misc Pickup 51|Hermes|We'll have you racing out of here in no time, Coz!
HermesMiscPickup52|Hermes Misc Pickup 52|Hermes|How goes it underground of late, there, boss?
HermesMiscPickup53|Hermes Misc Pickup 53|Hermes|Nice day we're having on the surface! You should see it, boss!
HermesMiscPickup54|Hermes Misc Pickup 54|Hermes|Another day, another race up to the top! You ready, boss?
HermesMiscPickup55|Hermes Misc Pickup 55|Hermes|Well, here we go again! Let's go, then, boss!
HermesFirstLootPickup01|Hermes First Loot Pickup 01|Hermes|Got here as quickly as I could, boss. Now what say we get you promptly the hell out of there!
HermesFirstLootPickup02|Hermes First Loot Pickup 02|Hermes|Hey Coz, gathered you were just about to make another go of breaking out of there! Thought I'd stop by and give you a boost.
HermesFirstLootPickup03|Hermes First Loot Pickup 03|Hermes|You're raring for your next trek out of there, right, boss? Well then I guess I got here just in time.
HermesFirstLootPickup04|Hermes First Loot Pickup 04|Hermes|Heard you were heading out again, boss. Changed my schedule around a bit, not a big deal, and figured I'd drop in!
HermesFirstLootPickup05|Hermes First Loot Pickup 05|Hermes|You're off again, are you? All right well then safe travels! Or swift travels, failing that!
HermesFirstLootPickup06|Hermes First Loot Pickup 06|Hermes|You ready for another go at this, Coz? Well then think I can speed you on your journey there.
HermesLootBought01|Hermes Loot Bought 01|Hermes|Why, hello, Coz! Odd that we're running into one another here! Among the wares of my professional associate, I mean. Must be some sort of clerical mistake!
HermesLootBought01_B|Hermes Loot Bought 01 B|Hermes|Why, hello, boss! Odd that we're running into one another here! Among the wares of my professional associate, I mean. Must be some sort of clerical mistake!
HermesLootBought02|Hermes Loot Bought 02|Hermes|You're well familiar with my professional associate, there, with the boat? Souls of the recently departed got to make it over to the Underworld somehow. Part of my job! I bring them in, he takes them down.
HermesLootBought03|Hermes Loot Bought 03|Hermes|I guess I'm used to these one-sided chats here, boss, thanks to my work experience with my professional associate down there! You tell him I said hi, all right?
HermesLootBought04|Hermes Loot Bought 04|Hermes|A word of caution, Coz. Don't ask too many questions about me, or my professional associate down there. I hand souls over to him, and that's it, you understand?
HermesLootBought05|Hermes Loot Bought 05|Hermes|Wouldn't you know it, boss! I was just minding my own business, handing off a few dearly departed souls to my professional associate, and who shows up, but *you*?
HermesLootBought06|Hermes Loot Bought 06|Hermes|My heavy-breathing professional associate was gracious enough to drop me off here with his other stuff, and for quite an affordable price, at that!
HermesLootBought07|Hermes Loot Bought 07|Hermes|All right, then, let's go make that spend of hard-earned coin well worth your while! What do you think, Coz?
HermesLootBought08|Hermes Loot Bought 08|Hermes|I'd tell you not to ask too many questions of my good professional associate nearby, but then, *who are we kidding*, boss? Not like he'd answer you those questions anyhow!
HermesLootBought09|Hermes Loot Bought 09|Hermes|Message for you, boss, from my professional associate, who wanted you to know, and I quote, *'Hhhrrrrnnnngggggghhhhhh.'*
HermesLootBought10|Hermes Loot Bought 10|Hermes|Been working with my good professional associate, the boatman there, since I-don't-know-how-long. Though, let me tell you, Coz, we haven't had a job quite like this yet!
HermesLootBought11|Hermes Loot Bought 11|Hermes|Among the many ways in which you could parlay your earnings into better chances of survival here, I'm flattered you would think of me this time!
HermesLootBought12|Hermes Loot Bought 12|Hermes|How strange of a coincidence that you keep running into me along the riverside like this, don't you agree, there, Coz?
HermesLootBought13|Hermes Loot Bought 13|Hermes|Don't normally go selling off my blessings to the highest bidder, boss, but your bid there is good enough for me!
HermesGift01|Hermes Gift 01|Zagreus|Lord Hermes, please accept this gift as a small token of my appreciation. Thank you for always keeping me on my toes.
HermesGift01|Hermes Gift 01|Hermes|*Oh*! Mighty keen of you to leave a tip, there, boss. And I've a tip for you: Don't be slow! Maybe this will help with that.
HermesGift02|Hermes Gift 02|Zagreus|Lord Hermes sir, you've asked for nothing in return, and so, please take this humble offering, because... it's nothing, really!
HermesGift02|Hermes Gift 02|Hermes|Well now, that's awful kind, there, Coz! No need to thank me, though. Not so profusely anyhow!
HermesGift03|Hermes Gift 03|Zagreus|Hermes, my friend? May I call you my friend? I hope this modest offering will lift your spirits but won't slow you down.
HermesGift03|Hermes Gift 03|Hermes|I look like I got the sort of time to sip Nectar, Coz? Well, guess what, I do! So, cheers!
HermesGift04|Hermes Gift 04|Zagreus|Ever since we met, Lord Hermes, life here in the Underworld has been much faster-paced, and I am ever grateful. This is for you.
HermesGift04|Hermes Gift 04|Hermes|Hey, boss, I appreciate the tip. But just as a reminder, all my services are paid in full already! No need for special thanks. Though... cheers.
HermesGift05|Hermes Gift 05|Zagreus|I never could have come this far this quickly had it not been for your tireless support, Lord Hermes, sir. I'm in your debt.
HermesGift05|Hermes Gift 05|Hermes|You know, Coz, I got to say I had a few concerns when we first met, your father being who he is and all. But you're all right!
HermesGift06|Hermes Gift 06|Zagreus|This one's for you, swift and sure-footed messenger of the gods! You make what you do look easy. But I know you're going out of your way. Thank you so much, Hermes.
HermesGift06|Hermes Gift 06|Hermes|My rule is not to let things get too personal as far as work-related matters are concerned, Coz. But you're family! And, well, you're a right decent chap, I think. Offering up a bit of Nectar to me in the middle of all this!
HermesGift07|Hermes Gift 07|Zagreus|I salute you, Lord Hermes, with this rarest of delicacies! Pretty rare here, anyway. You never show it, but I can only imagine how hard you must be working to back me up. Cheers, mate!
HermesGift07|Hermes Gift 07|Hermes|You know, the last time anybody offered me Ambrosia from the Underworld was *never*, before now! That's quite a gesture on your part. You could have just as well taken my services for granted and I'd not have minded in the least! But, thank you, Coz.
HermesGift08|Hermes Gift 08|Zagreus|Message for you, Lord Hermes! It says, *'This offering is dedicated to the incomparable god of swiftness, from whom the news is always good, because he's bringing it. You are a real mate, you know that? I really owe you one.' *Zagreus.
HermesGift08|Hermes Gift 08|Hermes|Look, Coz, I am going to accept this choice Ambrosia from you one last time, all right? But from this point, I am doubling down on all professional responsibilities, here. Strictly business between us! Although, secretly, you're one of my best mates. Want you to know.
ChaosAboutBeowulfAspect01_A|Chaos About Beowulf Aspect 01 A|Chaos|I sense that you have not yet spoken with the all-seeing artifact you call Aegis. Tamper with the Fates' design, then, all you like. But if you change your mind, do speak the words to it: *I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame.*
ChaosAboutBeowulfAspect01|Chaos About Beowulf Aspect 01|Chaos|You have not yet used the waking-phrase that I imparted? Or perhaps you merely chose not to present me the result. I would quite like to see it, at some point. Remember, Son of Hades: Say to the all-seeing artifact, *I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame.*
ChaosAboutBeowulfAspect02|Chaos About Beowulf Aspect 02|Chaos|Out of the infinitely spanning possibilities, here before me stands the Son of Hades, bearing my all-seeing artifact, appearing in the aspect of a bearer yet unborn, who shall be known throughout the north as Beowulf. How very droll.
ChaosSurfaceQuestComplete|Chaos Surface Quest Complete|Chaos|I faintly sensed that you were able to confront your father while in possession of my small round catalyst. It seems my asking you, and your success, was in accordance with the Fates' design, as well. The result is more amusing even than expected. Thus, thank you.
ChaosAboutNyx05|Chaos About Nyx 05|Chaos|I have detected some unusual activity within the reaches of the Underworld, Son of Hades... vast sums of Darkness, collected in an ancient catalyst, which I see now almost like a beacon, shining in the night. This either is the work of Nyx, or you, or both. I am anticipating the result.
ChaosAboutNyx06|Chaos About Nyx 06|Chaos|It pleases me immensely, Son of Hades, to have seen the goddess Nyx again. The significant amount of time that has elapsed since last this happened dulled sufficiently old pains, I think. Thus, it becomes a basis on which our connection may, in time, take shape again.
ChaosAboutResponding01|Chaos About Responding 01|Chaos|As we become acquainted, Son of Hades, I shall make myself quite clear in one respect: I fear I have a lack of patience for discussion. When visiting, please merely listen, then accept my mark, and then depart. Respond only when necessary. Or when prompted. Yes?
ChaosAboutResponding01|Chaos About Responding 01|Zagreus|...Merely listen, so it's just like when I get those messages from the Olympians. Wait, you did just prompt me, Master Chaos, didn't you? Or should I have remained silent just now?
ChaosAboutResponding01|Chaos About Responding 01|Chaos|I cannot offer you advice. But you were prompted, yes. You may speak freely, then, or anytime, despite my wishes that you not do so. Absolute silence is my general preference. It may not be yours.
ChaosAboutNyx01|Chaos About Nyx 01|Chaos|I understand that Zeus and all his kin on Mount Olympus think that you are born of Hades and the goddess Nyx? I was amused to learn of this deception. Nyx has mothered many of the Underworld's own, so, why not you?
ChaosAboutNyx01|Chaos About Nyx 01|Zagreus|She isn't my birthmother, no, but she is like a mother to me. Do you know her?
ChaosAboutNyx01|Chaos About Nyx 01|Chaos|Oh, I know the goddess Nyx quite well, of course. Though, it has been a while since we last communicated, and I fear... well, I was not the charitable sort, back then. It is my hope that Nyx is faring well.
ChaosAboutNyx01_B|Chaos About Nyx 01 B|Chaos|I knew you would arrive. But only in the moments prior to the fact. Thus, I am experiencing residual surprise. Your movements through the Underworld are as though a veil of darkness enshrouds you. The goddess Nyx's influence, perhaps? Respond.
ChaosAboutNyx01_B|Chaos About Nyx 01 B|Zagreus|I... do not know how to respond to that, exactly, Master Chaos, but, Nyx, yes, she has been aiding me, in my attempts to flee my father's realm.
ChaosAboutNyx01_B|Chaos About Nyx 01 B|Chaos|You move in darkness, not as infinitely black as hers, but reminiscent to me, nonetheless. I would invite her to try to elude me, and then attempt to locate her. A minor amusement for the both of us. Now, I have you for this, I see.
ChaosPostEnding01|Chaos Post Ending 01|Chaos|Lately, Son of Hades, I have sensed what I would call a sort of shift within your father's residence. Did something noteworthy occur, perhaps? Respond.
ChaosPostEnding01|Chaos Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Master Chaos, it's Persephone, my mother. She's returned! She's chosen to return. So... things feel different, certainly, with her around, although... I didn't feel any sort of shift.
ChaosPostEnding01|Chaos Post Ending 01|Chaos|You may not sense these shifts as I. The lightness of this space bends and adjusts with time. What you describe... it must have been the cause. I trust that the occasion is a welcome one. And I am pleased that you returned, nevertheless.
ChaosAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Chaos About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Chaos|Again I sensed some sort of shifting in your father's residence. You seek to ask something of me about it, do you not? Respond.
ChaosAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Chaos About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Oh, I'm glad you asked, it's just... my mother, she's... we're reaching out to the Olympians. Trying to reconnect the family. It's been a while, relatively, since she and Father saw the others, but... in case a gathering occurs, I did wish you to know you're cordially invited, too.
ChaosAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Chaos About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Chaos|Cordially invited...? A generous proposal, Son of Hades, though unless your gathering is to occur within my space, please understand it would be difficult for me to bring the full entirety of my presence there. However... I think I can arrange to be with you in some capacity. Thank you.
ChaosPostEpilogue01|Chaos Post Epilogue 01|Chaos|It pleases me your gathering of the Olympians occurred. I must inform you... I had never once before detected quite so many of my offspring in a single space. At least not without violent intent. I appreciate that you included me, and that you have returned. Shall we continue, then?
ChaosPostEpilogue01_B|Chaos Post Epilogue 01 B|Chaos|It pleases me your gathering of the Olympians occurred. I must inform you... I had never once before detected quite so many of my offspring in a single space. At least not without violent intent.
ChaosAboutZeus01|Chaos About Zeus 01|Chaos|You bear the blessing of the great Lord Zeus. He still believes he holds dominion over both heaven and earth. I think, perhaps, he has forgotten about me.
ChaosAboutPoseidon01|Chaos About Poseidon 01|Chaos|Lord Poseidon offered you his blessing, it would seem. He can be rather boastful and belligerent, exhibiting the most unattractive manners of your father and Lord Zeus alike.
ChaosAboutAthena01|Chaos About Athena 01|Chaos|This wise goddess Athena has imbued you with her charms, I see, O Son of Hades. Perhaps to her you are a tool with which her broken family may as yet be mended.
ChaosAboutAres01|Chaos About Ares 01|Chaos|It is not unexpected that you consorted with the violent Ares, and now bear his Boon. He still worships me, you know; yet, I would say he does not know me very well.
ChaosAboutAphrodite01|Chaos About Aphrodite 01|Chaos|The charms of goddess Aphrodite are upon you unmistakably, although I shall be curious to see if her command over one's sense of love shall have any effect beneath the earth.
ChaosAboutArtemis01|Chaos About Artemis 01|Chaos|I understand the hunting-goddess Artemis recently has turned her gaze towards you. It is unexpected she would offer her assistance, even to a relative in need.
ChaosAboutDionysus01|Chaos About Dionysus 01|Chaos|The drunkard Dionysus offered you his services, I see? He can be rather unpredictable, and therefore offers me a source of some amusement.
ChaosAboutHermes01|Chaos About Hermes 01|Chaos|Swift Hermes spurs you on, I see, O Son of Hades. Beware the narrow distance between hastiness and swiftness; a distinction I am not so sure the god of travel fully understands.
ChaosAboutDemeter01|Chaos About Demeter 01|Chaos|Embittered Demeter has reached you, hasn't she? She once was full of warmth, you know; but lately, as I understand, she is more prone to taking it away.
ChaosAboutOlympians01|Chaos About Olympians 01|Chaos|You have met many of the Olympians by now, each spurring you toward their mountaintop. They place such value on familial bonds, yet none of them remember who I am. Do not place too much faith in them, O Son of Hades.
ChaosAboutOlympians02|Chaos About Olympians 02|Chaos|I ask you listen but not speak, O Son of Hades, whilst the Olympians? They do not ask at all. They merely send their messages to you, unprompted, providing a choice of blessing, but no say. I seek to understand their point of view. But it is difficult.
ChaosAboutOlympians03|Chaos About Olympians 03|Chaos|When you extend an offering to the Olympians, for a fleeting instant, it appears as though they are able to hear your prayer. Or so I have observed. How interesting that your thoughts are capable of breaking free, yet you cannot.
ChaosAboutHades01|Chaos About Hades 01|Chaos|Your father and his brothers, when they sealed the Titans in the darkest reaches of this world, that was the last they saw of me, as well. You are dissimilar from them, and I feel safe communicating thus with you.
ChaosAboutNyx01_C|Chaos About Nyx 01 C|Chaos|I was at times uncharitable with the goddess Nyx, when we were closer, long ago. After she bore her first children, I nevertheless expected her attention to remain undivided. I kept creating. When finally I slowed, I realized my mistake. But our connection had been severed, by that point.
ChaosAboutNyx02|Chaos About Nyx 02|Chaos|I sense that something is the matter, Son of Hades. Speak, then, what is on your mind? I can decipher some of it without your telling though would rather hear it from you voluntarily.
ChaosAboutNyx02|Chaos About Nyx 02|Zagreus|*Erm*, Master Chaos? The goddess Nyx, she... seems to want to speak with you again. I wonder, would you maybe contact her sometime? She seems convinced it is your move to make if you so choose.
ChaosAboutNyx02|Chaos About Nyx 02|Chaos|The goddess Nyx wishes to hear from me...? Now that is unexpected, Son of Hades, and I wonder if, perhaps, this is a jest of yours. Though, your intentions evidently are sincere. Then, I shall make no promises in this, except that... I am considering the possibility.
ChaosAboutNyx03|Chaos About Nyx 03|Chaos|Son of Hades, should eventually you spawn your own offspring... I recommend maintaining sub-infinite distances with them in space and time. Even if they are most tiresome, there always seems to come a point when one wishes to be in their presence once again.
ChaosAboutNyx04|Chaos About Nyx 04|Chaos|After some consideration, and on your recommendation, I attempted lately to make contact with the goddess Nyx again. She is quite distant from me now, of course. If you happen to know... did she receive the message well? Respond.
ChaosAboutNyx04|Chaos About Nyx 04|Zagreus|Well, Master Chaos, she can be a little difficult to read at times, but... I got the impression she was quite surprised, even excited to have heard from you again. She said that she would think about how to respond. Or, whether to respond.
ChaosAboutNyx04|Chaos About Nyx 04|Chaos|I see. Well, she shall find a way, if it is warranted. I always did expect the world from her. There were times when I expected her to shine as bright as day, though she is Night. When she achieved a certain level of ability... she left. And I could not find her.
ChaosPostReunionQuest01|Chaos Post Reunion Quest 01|Chaos|My daughter, the goddess Nyx. When I learned the Olympians mistakenly assumed she was your mother, I did not fully consider the possibility that she essentially was a mother to you... the technicality of birth, aside. She cares for you to the extent a mother can.
ChaosPostReunionQuest02|Chaos Post Reunion Quest 02|Chaos|Prior to your intervention, Son of Hades, I expected that the goddess Nyx had forgotten about me... whether purposefully, or from passage of time. I believed that to be forgotten was the one true inevitability. Perhaps, however, I was incorrect.
ChaosPostReunionQuest03|Chaos Post Reunion Quest 03|Chaos|I find that it is difficult maintaining my connection with many consciousnesses, such as yours, and that of the goddess Nyx. Yet I am also finding that this difficulty is fully warranted. Our connections give me much to consider as I await our next exchange.
ChaosStatusImproved01|Chaos Status Improved 01|Chaos|Ah, here is my favorite among those immortals dwelling underneath the Earth. How may I change your life today, O Son of Hades?
ChaosStatusImproved02|Chaos Status Improved 02|Chaos|May you enjoy a moment's peace within my space before venturing on in uncertainty. To my surprise, I must admit I do appreciate the company.
ChaosPostFlashback01|Chaos Post Flashback 01|Chaos|Have you grown trusting yet of the Olympians, for all their generosity? Perhaps you ought to let them know the truth about your journey's goal. They are vain, and think that it is them you seek.
ChaosPostFlashback01|Chaos Post Flashback 01|Zagreus|I'll never get out of here if not for their help, but... I can't let them know about Mother. She wants to remain hidden from them.
ChaosPostFlashback01|Chaos Post Flashback 01|Chaos|A difficult position to be in, Son of Hades. The Olympians may not appreciate being misled. But you can trust that I shall keep your secret. I wish to see how your predicament plays out.
ChaosDarknessProgress01|Chaos Darkness Progress 01|Chaos|Such darkness emanates from you, O Son of Hades, that I once again did not entirely anticipate you would arrive just now. I suspect even your father must have difficulty keeping track of you through the domain he calls his own.
ChaosDarknessProgress02|Chaos Darkness Progress 02|Chaos|You move in darkness, practically unseen, Son of Hades. It is quite difficult even for me to sense your presence at times. The Olympians catch their glimpses now and then. But you are always in a shroud. Thus is the influence of Nyx.
ChaosAboutFates01|Chaos About Fates 01|Chaos|How strange it is to be subjected to the Fates. But do not fall into the cognitive delusion that they have already made your choices for you, Son of Hades. Rather, they are keen about anticipating every choice that everyone shall make. Such as the following.
ChaosAboutInfinity01|Chaos About Infinity 01|Chaos|I sense your consternation, Son of Hades, as you look about this space; you have another question, and are free to ask.
ChaosAboutInfinity01|Chaos About Infinity 01|Zagreus|Oh, it's just... I sometimes wonder, Master Chaos... if you created all of this, then... who created *you*? What was this place before you arrived?
ChaosAboutInfinity01|Chaos About Infinity 01|Chaos|All of this simply came to be, and so did I, presumably after a former time had finally reached its end. I hesitate to say it was an act of will. It was more like a sudden shift, as when a conflagration happens from a spark. I arrived at such a time, and all else then arrived, from me.
ChaosAboutDeath01|Chaos About Death 01|Chaos|When you expire, and then suddenly return to life within your father's residence, perhaps it is akin to when I first gained consciousness so long ago. Perhaps I, too, had just expired, only to reawaken.
ChaosAboutDiscovery01|Chaos About Discovery 01|Chaos|You may have wondered, Son of Hades, how it is you came to find me in this space, when I have gone unseen by most for quite some time. I have wondered this, as well, and think that our connection to Goddess Nyx is the most likely answer.
ChaosAboutPersephone01|Chaos About Persephone 01|Chaos|Son of Hades, I believe I have deduced something I ought have sooner recognized. Your mother must have been one who called herself Persephone. Her stay within the Underworld was brief, from my perspective, but impactful, nonetheless. You seek her now? Respond.
ChaosAboutPersephone01|Chaos About Persephone 01|Zagreus|I do. She's somewhere on the surface. That's why I keep on finding you like this. I'm trying to find her.
ChaosAboutPersephone01|Chaos About Persephone 01|Chaos|I hope that your attempts achieve success. She is beyond my senses, presently, though of course I am still able to assist you in your journey, thus.
ChaosAboutPersephone01_B|Chaos About Persephone 01 B|Chaos|Son of Hades, I believe I have deduced something I ought have sooner recognized. Your mother must have been one who called herself Persephone. Her stay within the Underworld was brief, from my perspective, but impactful, nonetheless. You seek her now? Respond.
ChaosAboutPersephone01_B|Chaos About Persephone 01 B|Zagreus|Oh, Master Chaos... you should know I have located her, already. Though where she is, I cannot stay for long. So I am visiting, as often as I can. It's... not unlike our visits here. Only, somehow, even harder to get to where she is.
ChaosAboutPersephone01_B|Chaos About Persephone 01 B|Chaos|I see. Then, it is good to know that you have been in contact. And I trust that your successive visits shall be worth their while. Not unlike our visits here.
ChaosAboutPersephone02|Chaos About Persephone 02|Chaos|Son of Hades, if you locate the one who called herself Persephone, shall it then come to pass that we no longer see each other in this way? Respond.
ChaosAboutPersephone02|Chaos About Persephone 02|Zagreus|Oh! I... Master Chaos, I don't know what to expect from there. But, to be direct with you, if I could leave the Underworld forever... I think I would. Though, I would miss you. Many others here.
ChaosAboutPersephone02|Chaos About Persephone 02|Chaos|...I would miss you as well. Thank you for telling me.
ChaosPostEnding02|Chaos Post Ending 02|Chaos|Tell me something, Son of Hades. If the one who called herself Persephone is back, then... why do you continue to return? Respond.
ChaosPostEnding02|Chaos Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Master Chaos, it seems I've developed something of a talent around breaking out of here. Or, there, I mean, the Underworld, so... it's become more of an official role for me, I guess. If escape shouldn't be possible, then someone needs to find the gaps.
ChaosPostEnding02|Chaos Post Ending 02|Chaos|Indeed. Then, you shall visit with me still, despite accomplishing the principal object of your journey back when first we met. Good.
ChaosAboutFishing01|Chaos About Fishing 01|Chaos|I am impressed that you were able to procure a specimen out from the flowing currents here in my domain, with nothing but a simple instrument. I shall look forward to your subsequent attempts.
ChaosAboutKeepsake01|Chaos About Keepsake 01|Chaos|I trust the small round catalyst which I provided you has been of value, Son of Hades? It is my hope it makes your journeys to this space less difficult, perhaps inducing them on a more frequent interval.
ChaosAboutBlackShawl01|Chaos About Black Shawl 01|Chaos|You have arrived within a certain shroud of darkness, Son of Hades. The goddess Nyx's ancient shawl. I had not sensed its void in a considerable amount of time.
ChaosAboutStyx01|Chaos About Styx 01|Chaos|You have traveled recently beyond my senses, Son of Hades. I persist here only in the fathomless depths. I know what lies out there, having created it. But I know nothing of what it is like, right now. Do not tell me. I prefer to think of all the possibilities.
ChaosSurfaceQuest01|Chaos Surface Quest 01|Chaos|From the rumblings of the earth, I have deduced your father, himself, stands against you when at last you are about to leave these depths. It must be quite an interaction between you. Have I deduced correctly? Respond.
ChaosSurfaceQuest01|Chaos Surface Quest 01|Zagreus|That's right, Master Chaos. My father personally takes it upon himself to stop me in the event none of his underlings beat him to it. He... can be a handful.
ChaosSurfaceQuest01|Chaos Surface Quest 01|Chaos|Well, then. Consider bringing to one of your future interactions the small round catalyst, which I provided you. The one in the shape you call an egg? It shall serve no purpose there at all. Yet if you succeed, then it shall bring us some amusement, shall it not?
ChaosLowHealth01|Chaos Low Health 01|Chaos|It seems to me that you are very close to death, O Son of Hades, and yet you deigned to visit me within my space. I could hasten your demise, if you so choose?
ChaosLowHealth02|Chaos Low Health 02|Chaos|I almost did not notice you, O Son of Hades, for you are closer now to death than life. Perhaps, though, we can stave off the inevitable for a little while.
ChaosLowHealth03|Chaos Low Health 03|Chaos|Your deaths are but a temporary setback, Son of Hades. Though it appears to me you are quite close to having such a setback, now.
ChaosLowHealth04|Chaos Low Health 04|Chaos|Your next experience with death seems to be imminent, though let us see if I can hasten or forestall it.
ChaosLowHealth05|Chaos Low Health 05|Chaos|It may seem cruel that I would wish you death, O Son of Hades. But from my perspective, it means you are much more likely to return to me.
ChaosLowHealth06|Chaos Low Health 06|Chaos|Although you may succumb soon to your injuries, please make the most of your remaining life, rather than anticipate the next. The future is uncertain to all save the Fates.
ChaosAboutShieldWeapon01|Chaos About Shield Weapon 01|Chaos|You come to my domain bearing an all-seeing artifact that sprang from me after the dawn of time. It is considered a defensive instrument, I do believe. Though, I suspect you have discovered, or soon shall discover, it is nothing of the sort.
ChaosAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Chaos About Weapon Enchantments 01|Chaos|I expected your arrival, Son of Hades. For I am able to see through you. Rather, through the all-seeing artifact, which sprang from me after the dawn of time, and now resembles, in your hands, its foremost form. Respond.
ChaosAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Chaos About Weapon Enchantments 01|Zagreus|What, you must mean the Shield of Chaos, here? *Your *shield, Master Chaos, I should say. It's a remarkable artifact. Imposing, too! Your original creations must have been astounding.
ChaosAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Chaos About Weapon Enchantments 01|Chaos|Your response is acceptable. And I am grateful to have had my recent firsthand glimpses of this vast domain.
ChaosAboutZeusAspect01|Chaos About Zeus Aspect 01|Chaos|Ah, you have that all-seeing artifact of mine, but in the old guise that the great Lord Zeus once used when he retaliated violently against his parentage. I watched his movements through it for some time.
ChaosRevealsBeowulfAspect01|Chaos Reveals Beowulf Aspect 01|Chaos|I bear a message for you, Son of Hades. One recorded in an age when certain concepts it describes did not yet all exist. Remember this: *I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame. *A waking-phrase, to which you and the all-seeing artifact of my creation may respond.
ChaosRevealsBeowulfAspect01|Chaos Reveals Beowulf Aspect 01|Zagreus|A waking-phrase... and an all-seeing artifact, you must mean Aegis, right? So I'm to say to it, *I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame*, and it'll wake right up. Though, can you tell me what it means, or who?
ChaosRevealsBeowulfAspect01|Chaos Reveals Beowulf Aspect 01|Chaos|Oh, I can tell you almost anything. However, I would much prefer it if you learned most of the answers you seek by yourself.
ChaosFirstPickUp|Chaos First Pick Up|Zagreus|This is not someone I recognize... so, in the name of Hades! *Erm*, hello? May I ask who's calling?
ChaosFirstPickUp|Chaos First Pick Up|Chaos|...The Olympians have all grown soft... would you not agree?
ChaosFirstPickUp|Chaos First Pick Up|Zagreus|*Erm*... have we met?
ChaosFirstPickUp|Chaos First Pick Up|Chaos|Oh, we have met, in a way. I know everybody, here, and there. You wish to leave this place? Then, it is my wish to make your doing so a little bit more interesting... and, if you encounter the Olympians someday, do give them my regards.
ChaosMiscPickup01|Chaos Misc Pickup 01|Chaos|I sensed a certain rumbling here within the bowels of the earth. It is as though it had ingested something that did not sit well... perhaps the earth itself wishes to spit you up and out...?
ChaosMiscPickup02|Chaos Misc Pickup 02|Chaos|The Olympians are vying for your favor, are they not? So often they forget themselves. They force their blessings onto you, whilst I? I merely offer you a choice.
ChaosMiscPickup03|Chaos Misc Pickup 03|Chaos|Your path is yours to shape as you see fit, regardless of the Fates' design. Together we may twist that path a bit, if you would like.
ChaosMiscPickup04|Chaos Misc Pickup 04|Chaos|I both expected you to come and am surprised to see you, Son of Hades. Where shall your journey take you from this point?
ChaosMiscPickup05|Chaos Misc Pickup 05|Chaos|Please tell me how my power over all existence may be of small assistance to you this time, Son of Hades?
ChaosMiscPickup06|Chaos Misc Pickup 06|Chaos|The tremors underneath the earth foretold of your arrival at this very moment, Son of Hades; and, I have anticipated it.
ChaosMiscPickup07|Chaos Misc Pickup 07|Chaos|You chose to visit me again within these darkest reaches of the earth, as I, in turn, now choose to offer you the means to alter your reality.
ChaosMiscPickup08|Chaos Misc Pickup 08|Chaos|Back when I conceived the world and the immortals, Son of Hades, I did not expect you would be standing here before me now.
ChaosMiscPickup09|Chaos Misc Pickup 09|Chaos|You have arrived at last, just as I wondered how we might best alter one another's courses of existence here today.
ChaosMiscPickup10|Chaos Misc Pickup 10|Chaos|Son of Hades, let me welcome your return here to my space within the Underworld, and bid you choose an alteration to the fabric of reality.
ChaosMiscPickup11|Chaos Misc Pickup 11|Chaos|It pleases me that you are here again; for, through you I can tinker with reality, along the fringes that are not yet fully formed.
ChaosMiscPickup12|Chaos Misc Pickup 12|Chaos|Your presence never ceases to intrigue me, Son of Hades; for you are not like the Olympians on high, who have forgotten me, or thusly choose to act.
ChaosMiscPickup13|Chaos Misc Pickup 13|Chaos|From my perspective I have summoned you, whilst you believe you came of your volition; both statements can be true, is that not so?
ChaosMiscPickup14|Chaos Misc Pickup 14|Chaos|Come forth, O Son of Hades, and together, let us sow my namesake through the depths of what your father thinks his own domain.
ChaosMiscPickup15|Chaos Misc Pickup 15|Chaos|How fares these days the never-ending cycle of rebirth and death for you, O Son of Hades? Sufficiently amusing, I should hope?
ChaosMiscPickup16|Chaos Misc Pickup 16|Chaos|Out of the infinitely spanning possibilities before us, Son of Hades, I have arbitrarily selected only three again from which to let you choose.
ChaosMiscPickup17|Chaos Misc Pickup 17|Chaos|The Fates have much in store for you, O Son of Hades. Perhaps, however, we can tamper with their weavings here to some extent.
ChaosMiscPickup18|Chaos Misc Pickup 18|Chaos|Let us conspire to expand and frustrate your lord father's sense of both what is and is not possible within his Underworld.
ChaosMiscPickup19|Chaos Misc Pickup 19|Chaos|Infinite possibilities can be tedious to choose from, so, let me provide you with a significantly smaller set with which you may yet change the Fates' designs.
ChaosMiscPickup20|Chaos Misc Pickup 20|Chaos|Through the expanse of time, I often wondered, is it necessary to be fair? The immortals are my offspring; surely I should treat them equally. And yet I find that there is little sport in doing so.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra01|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 01|Chaos|Among infinite possibilities, consider only these.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra02|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 02|Chaos|Choose carefully, in general, and now.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra03|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 03|Chaos|We are the sum of all decisions that we make, and that are made for us.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra04|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 04|Chaos|This space grows far more interesting when you occupy a small amount of it.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra05|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 05|Chaos|How you evaluate decisions is of limitless interest to me.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra06|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 06|Chaos|The burden of the passing time shall force a choice from you.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra07|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 07|Chaos|Is there not pleasure in determining an outcome, Son of Hades?
ChaosMiscPickupExtra08|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 08|Chaos|My mark be with you, Son of Hades. You need merely choose its shape.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra09|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 09|Chaos|Though the waters of the Styx may wash away my mark, I can restore it.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra10|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 10|Chaos|The rhythm of your visits here over the course of time is pleasant, Son of Hades.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra11|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 11|Chaos|You are already back, and you are always welcome, Son of Hades.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra12|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 12|Chaos|Please visit me as frequently as you would like or dare.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra13|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 13|Chaos|I find myself anticipating your arrivals, Son of Hades.
ChaosMiscPickupExtra14|Chaos Misc Pickup Extra 14|Chaos|I require no exchange of words with you. Merely a choice.
ChaosMiscPickup21|Chaos Misc Pickup 21|Chaos|Once more you have returned to my domain.
ChaosMiscPickup22|Chaos Misc Pickup 22|Chaos|I have a proposition, Son of Hades.
ChaosMiscPickup23|Chaos Misc Pickup 23|Chaos|I bid you welcome here within my space.
ChaosMiscPickup24|Chaos Misc Pickup 24|Chaos|How fares the solitary Son of Hades?
ChaosMiscPickup25|Chaos Misc Pickup 25|Chaos|What shall we do for one another, Son of Hades?
ChaosMiscPickup26|Chaos Misc Pickup 26|Chaos|You are within my presence, Son of Hades.
ChaosMiscPickup27|Chaos Misc Pickup 27|Chaos|What brings you here to me this time around?
ChaosMiscPickup28|Chaos Misc Pickup 28|Chaos|Your such visits are agreeable with me.
ChaosMiscPickup29|Chaos Misc Pickup 29|Chaos|How may the force of Chaos alter you?
ChaosMiscPickup30|Chaos Misc Pickup 30|Chaos|You have arrived before me once again.
ChaosMiscPickup31|Chaos Misc Pickup 31|Chaos|I see that you are here, and so am I.
ChaosMiscPickup32|Chaos Misc Pickup 32|Chaos|You stand before me, Son of Hades.
ChaosMiscPickup33|Chaos Misc Pickup 33|Chaos|How shall we alter the intentions of the Fates?
ChaosMiscPickup33|Chaos Misc Pickup 33|Chaos|How might I mend the fabric of existence for you, Son of Hades?
ChaosMiscPickup34|Chaos Misc Pickup 34|Chaos|There need not be a reason for your visit.
ChaosMiscPickup35|Chaos Misc Pickup 35|Chaos|How may I shape reality for you?
ChaosMiscPickup36|Chaos Misc Pickup 36|Chaos|You are always welcome here within this space.
ChaosMiscPickup37|Chaos Misc Pickup 37|Chaos|What occupies your mind at this occasion?
ChaosMiscPickup38|Chaos Misc Pickup 38|Chaos|Let us consider certain possibilities.
ChaosMiscPickup39|Chaos Misc Pickup 39|Chaos|Among infinite outcomes, I propose these three.
ChaosMiscPickup40|Chaos Misc Pickup 40|Chaos|Choose how to circumvent the Fates' design.
ChaosMiscPickup41|Chaos Misc Pickup 41|Chaos|Hail, Son of Hades.
ChaosMiscPickup42|Chaos Misc Pickup 42|Chaos|I am amused to see you once again.
ChaosMiscPickup43|Chaos Misc Pickup 43|Chaos|You have descended to my space once more.
ChaosMiscPickup45|Chaos Misc Pickup 45|Chaos|You have returned to me.
ChaosMiscPickup46|Chaos Misc Pickup 46|Chaos|You are most welcome here.
ChaosWithNyx01|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (1)|Chaos|Your presence is appreciated, Son of Hades, but please leave us here, for now.
ChaosWithNyx02|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (2)|Chaos|Forgive us, Son of Hades, as we are amid exchanging memories.
ChaosWithNyx03|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (3)|Chaos|Son of Hades, I am pleased the goddess Nyx returned to me.
ChaosWithNyx04|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (4)|Chaos|Forgive me, Son of Hades, but I must continue this discussion with the goddess Nyx.
ChaosWithNyx05|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (5)|Chaos|I had not seen the goddess Nyx in quite some time.
ChaosWithNyx06|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (6)|Chaos|I am quite unaccustomed to having all this company of late.
ChaosWithNyx07|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (7)|Chaos|My daughter was just in the midst of telling me the latest occurrences about your House.
ChaosWithNyx08|Duo - Chaos and Nyx (8)|Chaos|As you are able to observe, the goddess Nyx and I are in the midst of conversation now.
ChaosLootBought01|Chaos Loot Bought 01|Chaos|Perhaps you did not think that I would seek you out among the boatman Charon's trifles, which precisely is the reason I have done it.
ChaosLootBought02|Chaos Loot Bought 02|Chaos|The boatman Charon understands my whims, and his loyalty is purchased easily by one for whom base wealth is meaningless, so, I am here.
ChaosGift01|Chaos Gift 01|Zagreus|Master Chaos? Everyone makes offerings to my relatives upon Olympus. I wish to make an offering to you. Thank you for... everything.
ChaosGift01|Chaos Gift 01|Chaos|How droll of you to make attempts to tempt me with material things. Here, then, please in turn allow me this attempt at reciprocity.
ChaosGift02|Chaos Gift 02|Zagreus|This is for you, Master Chaos. Everyone beneath the heavens and earth enjoys this stuff.
ChaosGift02|Chaos Gift 02|Chaos|You honor me in making such an offering, though please; it is not necessary to endear yourself using material means, for it is the thought alone which counts.
ChaosGift03|Chaos Gift 03|Zagreus|Master Chaos, forebear of the gods, it is an honor to have met you. Please, accept this gift.
ChaosGift03|Chaos Gift 03|Chaos|Seldom do mortals or immortals think of making offerings to me. As I do not expect such token gestures, I am very much amused, and I accept.
ChaosGift04|Chaos Gift 04|Zagreus|Master Chaos, I pledge never to forget you or your good graces. May your wisdom and your whim forever guide me.
ChaosGift04|Chaos Gift 04|Chaos|Is this an offering of fealty or friendship, Son of Hades? I do not wish to know from you the answer, so that I might dwell on it and all the possibilities.
ChaosGift05|Chaos Gift 05|Zagreus|I'm ever-grateful that my journeys through the Underworld mean that we can get to know each other, Master Chaos.
ChaosGift05|Chaos Gift 05|Chaos|Your repeated generosity with me is starting to become a bit predictable, and yet... somehow, I nonetheless appreciate it, still. How very odd.
ChaosGift06|Chaos Gift 06|Zagreus|Master Chaos, it's little wonder all existence sprang from you, because I see the noble qualities in so many I've met embodied in you. Please, accept this gift.
ChaosGift06|Chaos Gift 06|Chaos|If it is unclear yet, Son of Hades, I shall not be giving more to you in exchange for your repeated offerings. You give them to me knowing it shall serve no purpose and achieve no end. I know that there are some among both mortals and your kind for whom this is quite unacceptable.
ChaosGift07|Chaos Gift 07|Zagreus|This is the greatest delicacy of Olympus, Master Chaos. It's for you. I think normally it would be difficult for the Olympians to get it to you here.
ChaosGift07|Chaos Gift 07|Chaos|You make an even greater offering to me, knowing it shall produce no material result. You are aware that I am not persuadable? Yours is a squandering of resources and time. Although, of course, we do have each of these in great supply. Now then, respond.
ChaosGift07|Chaos Gift 07|Zagreus|...I just think the act of giving isn't quite the same as an exchange. I know I won't be getting any sort of other talisman or something in return. But, through these offerings, I can express my thanks. That's worth it by itself.
ChaosGift07|Chaos Gift 07|Chaos|...I see. So then, the action is akin to theft. For you are getting something in return that I did not intend to give. I still have much to learn from my creations, Son of Hades. So let us say that we have made an even trade. My learning for your worth.
ChaosGift08|Chaos Gift 08|Zagreus|If you'll forgive me, Master Chaos, this Ambrosia is intended to be given to those whom I care about, and I can think of few recipients I'd like to have it more. Please.
ChaosGift08|Chaos Gift 08|Chaos|I shall accept this, as a final offering, O Son of Hades. For I have given it additional consideration, and decided that my previous analysis of your intentions was too narrow, too inaccurate. And, I regret comparing what you have been doing to an act of theft. Respond?
ChaosGift08|Chaos Gift 08|Zagreus|Don't even mention it, please, Master Chaos. All of this is new for me, as well. I try never to overanalyze... my father does enough of that for all of us. I just know, when I encounter the primordial creator, I am going to give thanks. For everything.
ChaosGift08|Chaos Gift 08|Chaos|...I see. Then, your response is quite acceptable. And, since the act of giving is not an exchange, let us say that you already had my gratitude.
HadesFirstMeeting|Hades First Meeting|Hades|Stupid boy. I told you nobody gets out of here, whether alive or dead. Though, how was your wanton ransacking of my domain?
HadesFirstMeeting|Hades First Meeting|Zagreus|Greetings, Father. My ransacking was a delight, thank you for asking. So, I'll just be on my way, again.
HadesFirstMeeting|Hades First Meeting|Hades|Be on your way, indeed. What do I care? You shall never reach the surface. Go, see for yourself.
HadesFirstMeetingCont1|Hades First Meeting Cont 1|Hades|What is it, now? I've a mountain of infernal parchmentwork.
HadesFirstMeetingCont2|Hades First Meeting Cont 2|Hades|Out of my sight, now, go.
HadesFirstMeeting_B|Hades First Meeting B|Hades|To what do I owe the pleasure, boy? For I'm unaccustomed to being approached by you here in my House.
HadesFirstMeeting_B|Hades First Meeting B|Zagreus|Oh, you know. Just thought I'd check in, see what you were up to. Parchmentwork going all right, I'm sure?
HadesFirstMeeting_B|Hades First Meeting B|Hades|Oh yes, the parchmentwork is going splendidly. Would you care for some? There is no shortage of it, you see.
HadesLoungeClosed01|Hades Lounge Closed 01|Zagreus|Father, what happened to the lounge? The only place for anyone to have a little fun around here, and you seal it shut.
HadesLoungeClosed01|Hades Lounge Closed 01|Hades|Oh, I had little choice about that, boy. You see, after you fled the first time, Cerberus, why he was very much upset. Utterly tore the place to shreds. It's now under repair. All thanks to you.
HadesLoungeClosed01|Hades Lounge Closed 01|Zagreus|You're really blaming me for not minding the dog while I was out, and while you all were here?
HadesLoungeClosed01|Hades Lounge Closed 01|Hades|I lay the blame entirely upon you, yes. Who else? It's fortunate that Cerberus has calmed himself since then! Come to his senses, I should say. May you yet come to yours.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin01|Hades About Ghost Admin 01|Zagreus|Who's that sniveling shade to your immediate left, there, Father? Already found someone new to do the busywork. And here I thought I was utterly indispensable.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin01|Hades About Ghost Admin 01|Hades|That shade, boy, is my newly designated contractor; one whose responsibility is to work on this House. Though, who shall pay for everything my subjects here demand, I do not know.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin01|Hades About Ghost Admin 01|Zagreus|You're trying to guilt me into funding the exorbitant furnishings you desire.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin01|Hades About Ghost Admin 01|Hades|Perhaps once we are finished with repairs for all the carnage you have sown throughout my realm, then we might finally have time for all the needed renovations that have piled up.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin02|Hades About Ghost Admin 02|Hades|You have been keeping our contractor rather busy, I must say. Commissioning these frivolous projects around the House with the wealth you wrest from my domain. What are you hoping to achieve?
HadesAboutGhostAdmin02|Hades About Ghost Admin 02|Zagreus|Oh, you know, just giving back to the community. Figure if I'm to keep getting dragged back here it might as well be somewhat livable.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin02|Hades About Ghost Admin 02|Hades|Livable! When last I checked, making the Underworld livable was not among our top priorities. Just remember, in your brazenness, whose House this is.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin03|Hades About Ghost Admin 03|Zagreus|There's quite a lot of renovating to be done, isn't there, Father. Your House Contractor there has shown a wide variety of pending jobs.
HadesAboutGhostAdmin03|Hades About Ghost Admin 03|Hades|I've ordered Nyx to supervise that list. Entirely her problem, boy. And likely yours. How does it feel, knowing that your rampages create the need for so much maintenance?
HadesAboutGhostAdmin03|Hades About Ghost Admin 03|Zagreus|Feels pretty good, now that you mention it. Keeps everybody occupied, no?
HadesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Hades About Office Backstory 01|Zagreus|You know, Father! I must say ransacking your domain beats having to toil endlessly in the administrative chamber. Far less painful, really.
HadesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Hades About Office Backstory 01|Hades|*Hah! *Is that your way of asking me for your old job back, boy? You were a scourge upon every administrative duty to which you were assigned.
HadesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Hades About Office Backstory 01|Zagreus|Yes, please, Father, give me back my old, wretched job, won't you?
HadesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Hades About Office Backstory 01|Hades|Privileges are *earned *not begged for, boy. Unless you plan to reimburse this House for all the income that we lost because of you, then you shall not so much as set foot in the administrative chamber, again.
HadesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Hades About Office Backstory 01|Zagreus|How much is the reimbursement fee, anyway?
HadesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Hades About Office Backstory 01|Hades|Whichever exorbitant amount the House Contractor has on record, now leave me be!
HadesAboutOffice01|Hades About Office 01|Hades|So help me, boy, I cannot fathom why you would have bought back the authority to enter the administrative chamber once again.
HadesAboutOffice01|Hades About Office 01|Zagreus|I knew you thought I'd never do it under any circumstances, Father. That seemed reason enough. Though, fear not, I've no plans to reapply for a position there.
HadesAboutOffice01|Hades About Office 01|Hades|That does alleviate a deeply rooted fear of mine, in fact. The scene you caused in your brief time there yet remains a widely talked-about event among the shades who toil for me still.
HadesAboutShoulderSkulls01|Hades About Shoulder Skulls 01|Zagreus|Always wanted to ask you something, Father. Whose skull is that there on your shoulder? If it's not too personal.
HadesAboutShoulderSkulls01|Hades About Shoulder Skulls 01|Hades|I did not chronicle all Typhon's wretched offspring, boy. No one did. Some of them sit upon our shoulders now, lest we forget that things could easily have turned out rather differently, and much, much worse.
HadesAboutShoulderSkulls01|Hades About Shoulder Skulls 01|Zagreus|So these are just the remains of the spawn of the most hideous monstrosity of all time, which you and your brothers slew, got it. I guess putting the dead in their place is all part of the job. I can hardly imagine what it was like before you and the Olympians took charge.
HadesAboutKeepsake01|Hades About Keepsake 01|Hades|Be certain that you take appropriate precautions with the Sigil of the Dead that you now bear. Should some misfortune come to it through negligence, it cannot be replaced.
HadesAboutKeepsake01|Hades About Keepsake 01|Zagreus|I can't imagine what I'd do without your blessing, Father! But, thank you again. I don't often inherit Fate-appointed honors, and will take good care of it. Though... what if the Olympians catch on? Wouldn't do for everybody knowing that you're aiding me even a little, right?
HadesAboutKeepsake01|Hades About Keepsake 01|Hades|Correct. It would not do, at all. Fortunately, the power of the Unseen can remain well-hidden as it pleases. What is it your instructor always says?
HadesAboutKeepsake01|Hades About Keepsake 01|Zagreus|...Fear is for the weak?
HadesAllowsLegendaryKeepsakes01|Hades Allows Legendary Keepsakes 01|Hades|Those Chthonic Companion things you have from Nyx, or whoever they ended up with... I know they have been benefiting you.
HadesAllowsLegendaryKeepsakes01|Hades Allows Legendary Keepsakes 01|Zagreus|Yeah, well... I'm to attempt to escape this place by any means necessary, right? I figure if I can call on Olympus for aid, maybe some of my friends can help me in a pinch, as well.
HadesAllowsLegendaryKeepsakes01|Hades Allows Legendary Keepsakes 01|Hades|Not what I mean. Some of your *friends *have been reluctant to engage against me during our scuffles on the surface. Know that I have authorized them to proceed, if necessary.
HadesAllowsLegendaryKeepsakes01|Hades Allows Legendary Keepsakes 01|Zagreus|Wait, really? You're saying it's OK for your own loyal subjects to side against you up there? You won't take it out on them?
HadesAllowsLegendaryKeepsakes01|Hades Allows Legendary Keepsakes 01|Hades|I consider it an expansion of their responsibilities. Now, go.
HadesAboutZagreusPromotion01|Hades About Zagreus Promotion 01|Zagreus|So tell me, Father. Just how much did it hurt your soul knowing my face is up there on the Featured Houseservant Board, for all in the lounge to see?
HadesAboutZagreusPromotion01|Hades About Zagreus Promotion 01|Hades|Has it occurred to you that I, alone, have final say about whose countenance is shown up there? Although, others who shall not be named did put in a good word for you, repeatedly.
HadesAboutZagreusPromotion01|Hades About Zagreus Promotion 01|Zagreus|Blood and darkness... all my life I thought that board was a joke. But seeing my face up there... it felt good. Thanks, Father. Maybe it won't be the last time.
HadesAboutSundial01|Hades About Sundial 01|Hades|Indulge me for a moment, boy. Why bother to construct a sundial, there? Knowing full well it was my wish to have one installed. To demonstrate your awe-inspiring authority? Or to deny me the small pleasure of doing it myself?
HadesAboutSundial01|Hades About Sundial 01|Zagreus|Maybe a little of each? Or maybe you ought not second-guess my every motive and decision, constantly, searching for some sinister agenda that has yet to cross my mind?
HadesAboutSundial01|Hades About Sundial 01|Hades|*Pah! *I would have chosen an entirely different marble texture for it, anyway.
HadesLoungeRepaired01|Hades Lounge Repaired 01|Zagreus|Guess what, Father? The lounge is all tidied up. Your House Contractor there is quite efficient once you muster up the necessary funds. You should try it sometime!
HadesLoungeRepaired01|Hades Lounge Repaired 01|Hades|Are you expecting words of thanks because you paid the contractor to fix a bit of devastation that you caused? I fear it shall take rather more than that.
HadesLoungeRepaired01|Hades Lounge Repaired 01|Zagreus|What if I replaced every furnishing in this blasted place, would you treat me any better then?
HadesLoungeRepaired01|Hades Lounge Repaired 01|Hades|I suppose, boy, that there's only one way to find out. Though I suggest you save yourself the trouble.
HadesMiscMeeting01|Hades Misc Meeting 01|Hades|I see you've decided to come home. Changed your mind yet, or looking for more pain and suffering?
HadesMiscMeeting01|Hades Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|More pain and suffering, for sure. After all, you taught me to appreciate the finer things.
HadesMiscMeeting01|Hades Misc Meeting 01|Hades|You keep telling yourself that, boy. But, mark you my words, sooner or later, this life that you have chosen for yourself shall teach you I was right.
HadesMiscMeeting02|Hades Misc Meeting 02|Hades|Well that was quick. What news, boy, ready to give up, or no?
HadesMiscMeeting02|Hades Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|You'd like that, wouldn't you? Lucky I've got other family who believe in me.
HadesMiscMeeting02|Hades Misc Meeting 02|Hades|Be careful whom you give your trust. My brothers frolic on Olympus while we work. While *I *work! You're just like them. No wonder they like you.
HadesMiscMeeting03|Hades Misc Meeting 03|Hades|So, how did it go? How did you die ignobly this time, pray tell? Cerberus and I can't wait to hear the tale.
HadesMiscMeeting03|Hades Misc Meeting 03|Zagreus|In that case, I'll spare you the details.
HadesMiscMeeting03|Hades Misc Meeting 03|Hades|Fine. Your failure is quite easily imagined. How often it recurs! Almost as though my realm is built to keep you here. You, and every single soul that's ever lived. But, by all means, continue struggling.
HadesMiscMeeting04|Hades Misc Meeting 04|Hades|Welcome home, boy. You're late for dinner... or, breakfast, or whatever blasted meal's next.
HadesMiscMeeting04|Hades Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|That's all right, Father. I'm not feeling very hungry at the moment.
HadesMiscMeeting04|Hades Misc Meeting 04|Hades|...I've asked repeatedly for the construction of a sundial, but every time, they tell me no, can you believe it? Your impertinence with me inspires all.
HadesMiscMeeting04_B|Hades Misc Meeting 04 B|Hades|Welcome home, boy. You're late for dinner... or, breakfast, or whatever blasted meal's next.
HadesMiscMeeting04_B|Hades Misc Meeting 04 B|Zagreus|That's all right, Father. I'm not feeling very hungry at the moment.
HadesMiscMeeting04_B|Hades Misc Meeting 04 B|Hades|...I've asked repeatedly for the construction of a sundial, but every time, they tell me no, can you believe it?
HadesMiscMeeting05|Hades Misc Meeting 05|Hades|Blood and darkness, but this place is falling apart... nobody works an honest day down here.
HadesMiscMeeting05|Hades Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|Father, everybody's dead. Give them a break.
HadesMiscMeeting05|Hades Misc Meeting 05|Hades|What would you even know of honest work? At least the wretched dead yet honor me as Lord. I cannot say the same for you.
HadesMiscMeeting06|Hades Misc Meeting 06|Hades|Have you yet satisfied your foolish urges? Perhaps a lashing from the Furies' whips would set you straight.
HadesMiscMeeting06|Hades Misc Meeting 06|Zagreus|I had it out with them already, thanks.
HadesMiscMeeting06|Hades Misc Meeting 06|Hades|Such nonsense. First you defy me openly, and now you lie. On my next meeting with the Furies, we'll have a word about all this, you rest assured.
HadesMiscMeeting07|Hades Misc Meeting 07|Hades|Why, I can scarce believe my eyes, is that you, boy?! Cerberus, look who it is, he's back!
HadesMiscMeeting07|Hades Misc Meeting 07|Storyteller|*Cerberus looks mournfully toward the Prince.*
HadesMiscMeeting07|Hades Misc Meeting 07|Zagreus|No need to drag the dog into this, Father.
HadesMiscMeeting07|Hades Misc Meeting 07|Hades|Anything you say to me, you say in front of Cerberus! You might even learn a thing or two from him of listening, and of obedience!
HadesMiscMeeting08|Hades Misc Meeting 08|Hades|He's back already, Cerberus! Just as I indicated.
HadesMiscMeeting08|Hades Misc Meeting 08|Zagreus|I'm standing right here, Father.
HadesMiscMeeting08|Hades Misc Meeting 08|Hades|I'm sorry he disturbed your rest again, Cerberus, you've done a good job. The realm is well defended still, to the high standard that you set.
HadesMiscMeeting09|Hades Misc Meeting 09|Hades|What did I tell you, boy? Ever wasteful of your time, and mine. How fares my Underworld, *hm*?
HadesMiscMeeting09|Hades Misc Meeting 09|Zagreus|I don't know how you can stand it.
HadesMiscMeeting09|Hades Misc Meeting 09|Hades|Well, at least some things are running smoothly still. Next you go to die again, do give the tortured souls out there my warm regards.
HadesMiscMeeting10|Hades Misc Meeting 10|Hades|*Ah*, for shame, boy. I thought perhaps you'd finally made it out.
HadesMiscMeeting10|Hades Misc Meeting 10|Zagreus|Really...? I mean, oh, wait, you're not serious. That famous sense of humor shining through.
HadesMiscMeeting10|Hades Misc Meeting 10|Hades|I jest, of course, you'll never make it out; as I keep telling you to no avail. But you've gone farther than expected. So, who knows....
HadesMiscMeeting11|Hades Misc Meeting 11|Hades|...You've been gone a while...
HadesMiscMeeting11|Hades Misc Meeting 11|Zagreus|I'm going to find Mother. No matter how long it takes me.
HadesMiscMeeting11|Hades Misc Meeting 11|Hades|For the last time, you're not to speak about that woman in my House. You want to know of her so much, you go find her, indeed.
HadesPostFlashback01|Hades Post Flashback 01|Hades|I know that Nyx has been abetting you. You wish to take advantage of her pity? I care not. Her powers have their limits, anyway.
HadesPostFlashback01|Hades Post Flashback 01|Zagreus|How can you... Nyx is the Night Itself, and can do as she pleases, isn't that correct, Father? You think I asked she get involved in all this business?
HadesPostFlashback01|Hades Post Flashback 01|Hades|You, boy, have already dragged this entire household, not to mention my fool relatives, into this mess, which you've created. Which you dare call *business*.
HadesPostFlashback02|Hades Post Flashback 02|Zagreus|So, tell me something, Father, if you please. Since we're more candid lately in regard to matters of my birthright here, and all... did you and Mother... how to put this? Any brothers or sisters I should know about?
HadesPostFlashback02|Hades Post Flashback 02|Hades|I thought I told you never to invoke her here! Be thankful that you have no blasted kin. You've such weak blood, and such a temperament... why, then, would you think I'd risk another, such as you?
HadesPostFlashback02|Hades Post Flashback 02|Zagreus|Sure, that's fair enough, it's just not all such things occur as planned, as I am told. From tales of your brothers and so forth.
HadesPostFlashback02|Hades Post Flashback 02|Hades|Oh, blast my brothers, and blast you, as well! All those who know me know I have no heir. You could not rise to the occasion if you tried! And, there is no one else. You've only me. And I have only you.
HadesAboutOrpheusUnlockItem01|Hades About Orpheus Unlock Item 01|Zagreus|You call my chambers a mess, look at your desk, Father! Whatever happened to your court musician, huh, where's his sentencing parchmentwork? Stuck in Tartarus, all because he stopped singing for you on command?
HadesAboutOrpheusUnlockItem01|Hades About Orpheus Unlock Item 01|Hades|My desk is far more organized than *you*, boy! And if you're so concerned about our court musician, why don't you commute his sentence, yourself? Seeing as I haven't gotten around to it yet.
HadesAboutOrpheusUnlockItem01|Hades About Orpheus Unlock Item 01|Zagreus|Sure, happy to oblige. I'll just ask the House Contractor since you're too busy.
HadesAboutOrpheus01|Hades About Orpheus 01|Hades|I understand you have attempted to persuade our court musician to resume his craft. That is among the relatively useful tasks to which you have applied yourself of late.
HadesAboutOrpheus01|Hades About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|I can't be completely sure but, what you said just now I think contained some of the component pieces of a compliment?
HadesAboutOrpheus01|Hades About Orpheus 01|Hades|I'm certain that your boasts and twists of words shall soon inspire him to greater acts of compositional superiority, one of these days or nights.
HadesAboutOrpheusSingsAgain02|Hades About Orpheus Sings Again 02|Hades|I had a feeling that our court musician would eventually come back to his senses and his talents, boy. Here, yet again, my intuitions were correct. Though, you appear a bit perturbed. Don't like the song? It's about *you*!
HadesAboutOrpheusSingsAgain02|Hades About Orpheus Sings Again 02|Zagreus|It says I'm really the bastard son of Zeus, but also indelibly connected to the god of wine, and how your parents tore me to pieces, giving rise to mortals, but that I'm always going to be stuck here.
HadesAboutOrpheusSingsAgain02|Hades About Orpheus Sings Again 02|Hades|You fill Orpheus' mind with nonsense, he produces nonsense. Nonsense I presume shall spread from this place far and wide, so everyone might know that I have nothing to do with you.
HadesAboutOrpheusSingsAgain02|Hades About Orpheus Sings Again 02|Zagreus|I'm not worried. Orpheus plays for a very small audience.
HadesAboutEurydice01|Hades About Eurydice 01|Zagreus|Father, I met an oak nymph called Eurydice. You know her name, I think. Is it really true what happened between her and Orpheus? They say you almost let her out, so why not me?
HadesAboutEurydice01|Hades About Eurydice 01|Hades|*Pah! *Orpheus is a talented musician, and a fool. I knew he would never get his beloved wife out of here. There's no escape for her, or anyone, including you.
HadesAboutEurydice01|Hades About Eurydice 01|Zagreus|So you tricked him. Or maybe offered him a deal in bad faith. No matter. What's it going to take to waive the separation order between them?
HadesAboutEurydice01|Hades About Eurydice 01|Hades|That's non-negotiable, boy. Waiving a separation order! That's a veritable fortune in dues alone. Off the table. Now, go mind your own affairs, and leave the waiving and the ordering to me.
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Father, have you ever considered that Orpheus might be much better as a court musician if you permitted him to see his muse again?
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Hades|I have considered many possibilities, boy. And I trust Orpheus considered many possibilities before he signed away his rights to see his so-called muse when once he invaded my realm!
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|So you're forcing him to stay here for eternity just because he signed a contract with you?
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Hades|Contracts with me are binding! Until such time as they dig themselves out of the archives and tear themselves up! And I don't see that happening anytime soon.
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest01_B|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01 B|Zagreus|Father, let's say, hypothetically, that I could pay the dues to waive the separation order between Orpheus and Eurydice. Would you honor the new terms, or spitefully cheat me out of a fair deal?
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest01_B|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01 B|Hades|I honor the terms of my commitments, boy. The rules we put in place are all that keep this Underworld in any semblance of a shape! But, what you ask is utterly absurd. The costs of processing a separation order are well beyond your means.
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest02|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02|Hades|You voided the contract with our court musician. Used your own authority against me.
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest02|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|So what if I did? Just gives him a bit of break from time to time. He's still your court musician, isn't he?
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest02|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02|Hades|He is. And he knows better than to undermine me, I think. Out with you, then! I'll deal with your insubordination some other time.
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest02_B|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02 B|Hades|You voided the contract with our court musician. Used your own authority against me.
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest02_B|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02 B|Zagreus|So what if I did? Just gives him a bit of break from time to time. He's still your court musician, isn't he?
HadesAboutSingersReunionQuest02_B|Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02 B|Hades|He is. And he knows better than to undermine me, I think. Though, I suppose the Queen would take your side that he has paid his dues in full, by now...?
HadesAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Hades About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Zagreus|Father, let me ask you something work-related, here. I know the shade called Sisyphus once wronged both you and Thanatos, and has since paid a heavy price. But don't the Fury Sisters now have better things to do than torture him?
HadesAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Hades About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Hades|You come to *me *to question how I allocate my resources? Preposterous. I care nothing for that wretched shade. That he is tortured for eternity is but a technicality resulting from his arrogance. The terms of his incarceration are long lost!
HadesAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Hades About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Zagreus|So then if I could somehow find those terms, then theoretically, I could grant him a pardon...
HadesAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Hades About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Hades|If you could somehow do your job, and enact miracles, then yes! You could do anything, then, I suppose. Including waste your time on those of his undeserving ilk.
HadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Hades|You altered one of my own pacts, without so much as seeking my consent... undoing terms that were agreed upon. Do you intend to undermine everything in this House, boy? Or only me?
HadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Only you, Father. Good thing I've inherited some of your Fate-given authority, being your son and all. Otherwise some of your most loyal subjects would be bound by exploitive terms for eternity.
HadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Hades|Terms that *they *chose, themselves! Terms to the benefit of this House. What if Achilles were to leave his post for the green pastures of Elysium, what then?
HadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|You could find a replacement? But it's a pointless question anyway, because he's here! He isn't leaving. He might even do better at his job, now that he has increased ability to step away from it.
HadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Hades|A naive hope, at best. The more you step away from your responsibilities, the less you shall want anything to do with them.
HadesRunProgress01|Hades Run Progress 01|Hades|Megaera tells me that you surpassed her while out there. How utterly embarrassing for her, to say the least.
HadesRunProgress01|Hades Run Progress 01|Zagreus|I suppose you're going to punish her in some cruel fashion, then?
HadesRunProgress01|Hades Run Progress 01|Hades|Oh, I've already seen to that, of course. You think she volunteered to deal with you? Nobody did. That's how ignoble a task it is.
HadesRunProgress02|Hades Run Progress 02|Hades|Tell me something, boy, did you enjoy the searing heat of Asphodel? You must have thought that you'd be more resilient to it.
HadesRunProgress02|Hades Run Progress 02|Zagreus|I'm open to a change of climate. Even if it gets a bit uncomfortable.
HadesRunProgress02|Hades Run Progress 02|Hades|You know nothing of discomfort, yet. Making it out of Tartarus is nothing in comparison to what lies ahead for you.
HadesRunProgress03|Hades Run Progress 03|Hades|I understand that you created quite a stir within Elysium. An all-out brawl within eternal paradise!
HadesRunProgress03|Hades Run Progress 03|Zagreus|You call that paradise? It's just a bunch of shades bored out of their former skulls, itching for a chance to feel alive again.
HadesRunProgress03|Hades Run Progress 03|Hades|What would you know of it! The greatest mortals have their every need fulfilled within that place. I dread to hear what they shall say of all of this.
HadesRunProgress04|Hades Run Progress 04|Hades|Tell me something, boy, because my own set of ideas on the subject is beginning to run dry: What, exactly, is it going to take for you to understand that you're not leaving here?
HadesRunProgress04|Hades Run Progress 04|Zagreus|Perhaps you ought to have me bound next to Prometheus, and have the dreaded Eagle peck my liver for eternity?
HadesRunProgress04|Hades Run Progress 04|Hades|You would have me resort to such barbarity? Blast you, boy. Punishment is not the path to rehabilitation; it is for its own sake. I'd have expected all your trips through Tartarus to have taught you as much.
HadesRunProgress05|Hades Run Progress 05|Hades|I'm truly sorry that he's troubled you again, Cerberus. I know how much you value resting here, and yet, I have no better means to bar the entry to our realm than you.
HadesRunProgress05|Hades Run Progress 05|Zagreus|I thought you'd figured out by now that guilting me into abandoning my quest won't work. You're the one who should feel guilty, forcing Cerberus to block my path.
HadesRunProgress05|Hades Run Progress 05|Hades|What would you know of it? Cerberus cannot be forced to do anything. He simply understands he has responsibilities.
HadesAboutCharonFight01|Hades About Charon Fight 01|Hades|*Ah*, verify something for me, here, boy. According to the latest reports... you attempted unsuccessfully to shoplift from Charon, himself? And were consequently slain? Utterly ignoble end, even for you.
HadesAboutCharonFight01|Hades About Charon Fight 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, I was *borrowing*, OK? Not shoplifting. Why didn't anybody ever tell me Charon was such a monster? I thought the boating mercantile thing made for a peaceful life.
HadesAboutCharonFight01|Hades About Charon Fight 01|Hades|You incur the wrath of ancient chthonic gods, and then are surprised to be destroyed by them? Have you learned nothing, after all this time?
HadesAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Hades About Weapon Enchantments 01|Hades|How are you finding my old trusty spear, then, *hm*? Or perhaps you have a preference for my brothers' and my sisters' former arms. Kept under lock and key, and yet, they're now in your possession, it would seem.
HadesAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Hades About Weapon Enchantments 01|Zagreus|The weapons in the courtyard. Of course you know about them, by now. I stole them. Why not just take them from me? I'd be stuck.
HadesAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Hades About Weapon Enchantments 01|Hades|The thought has long since crossed my mind. However, I'm not fool enough to tamper with those cursed things. They go where they please. They cannot be contained. Like you. Now, why don't you go entertain each other more?
HadesAboutFurySistersUnion01|Hades About Fury Sisters Union 01|Zagreus|Megaera and her sisters ganged up on me that time. I didn't think anyone could talk her into working with Alecto and Tisiphone again. Or even be in the same chamber.
HadesAboutFurySistersUnion01|Hades About Fury Sisters Union 01|Hades|I can be quite persuasive under certain circumstances, boy. Though my advice to you, not that you'll take it, is not to discuss the matter openly. Megaera is a professional; but she has made her feelings on the matter clear.
HadesAboutSatyrs01|Hades About Satyrs 01|Hades|It is woefully infrequent that I've cause for this, but I do have to thank you, boy. You've culled the Satyrs and the vermin bringing ruin to our Temple, there! Blasted creatures multiply at an alarming rate.
HadesAboutSatyrs01|Hades About Satyrs 01|Zagreus|They're not doing your bidding, yet they're every bit as bothersome as all your wretched servants I've met. I'm surprised you aren't getting along.
HadesAboutSatyrs01|Hades About Satyrs 01|Hades|They are a plague upon this realm, although we have them well contained, for now. And once they are rightly dead, they tend to swear to me their fealty.
HadesAboutCharon01|Hades About Charon 01|Zagreus|Father, you always said the Olympians wanted nothing to do with our kind. But doesn't Charon work directly with Hermes? Maybe it's *you *who wants nothing to do with *them*.
HadesAboutCharon01|Hades About Charon 01|Hades|I want nothing to do with them, correct. My hasty nephew assists Charon out of necessity, alone. Not even Thanatos is able to keep up with the rate at which mortals expire and must then cross our borders.
HadesAboutCharon01|Hades About Charon 01|Zagreus|Want me to pitch in? Just give me your blessing and I'll head straight for the surface.
HadesAboutCharon01|Hades About Charon 01|Hades|*Hahaha*, no. I think not, boy. You are born of this realm. The surface is a wind-swept waste. You don't know how good you have it here.
HadesAboutMother01|Hades About Mother 01|Hades|She is gone, boy. She is gone. You are never going to locate her. I thought you would have come to that conclusion for yourself, by now. But apparently it must be said.
HadesAboutMother01|Hades About Mother 01|Zagreus|You mean Mother. How would you even know? You said reaching the surface was impossible as well, and I'm in striking distance.
HadesAboutMother01|Hades About Mother 01|Hades|This is my final warning to you, boy... to cease this mindless quest. Or else, the consequences shall be worse than what you have experienced thus far.
HadesAboutThrone01|Hades About Throne 01|Hades|Whatever you did to my blasted seat is of no consequence to me. From my vantage-point, I can't even see it! A foolish prank and waste of valuable resources, nothing more.
HadesAboutThrone01|Hades About Throne 01|Zagreus|It's more for everybody else than you, Father. Think of it as a tribute to Cerberus! Besides, you really should think about changing up the look of this place from time to time. Keep things fresh!
HadesAboutThrone01|Hades About Throne 01|Hades|The limitless work keeps things fresh enough as it is. Though if making aimless changes in this House is how you choose to spend your limitless time, I'll have no part of it.
HadesAboutSkelly01|Hades About Skelly 01|Zagreus|Father, of all the skeletons and such in your direct employ... you wouldn't happen to have any here around the House, would you? Out in my courtyard, for example?
HadesAboutSkelly01|Hades About Skelly 01|Hades|*Skeletons*! I'm sure they'll welcome you when next you visit Asphodel. You may not realize it, boy, but we have a certain standard of decency we uphold around here!
HadesAboutWar01|Hades About War 01|Zagreus|You ever think of giving Thanatos a break, Father? He seems to have more than his fair share of work of late.
HadesAboutWar01|Hades About War 01|Hades|Blame the blasted mortals for perishing so easily, or blame Lord Ares, prior to accusing me. With their surface wars, not only do they kill each other readily, but also often subsequently perish from the consequences of it all!
HadesAboutWar01|Hades About War 01|Zagreus|What wars, what's going on up there? Why don't the other Olympians do something?
HadesAboutWar01|Hades About War 01|Hades|*Pah*! How should I know? The mortals are equipped to settle their petty differences by any number of means. We have to make room for them all sooner or later, regardless.
HadesAboutMinotaur01|Hades About Minotaur 01|Hades|So, you had a run-in with the Minotaur out in Elysium, did you? Perhaps the only soul within this realm more bull-headed than you.
HadesAboutMinotaur01|Hades About Minotaur 01|Zagreus|How long have you been waiting to use that line, Father? Wouldn't put it past you to have sent the Bull of Minos to Elysium entirely so we could have this conversation now.
HadesAboutMinotaur01|Hades About Minotaur 01|Hades|You give me too much credit, boy. The Minotaur resides where he resides because of an entirely different arrangement.
HadesAboutMinotaur01|Hades About Minotaur 01|Zagreus|He's working for you, isn't he? You think he can stop me.
HadesAboutMinotaur01|Hades About Minotaur 01|Hades|Most in Elysium jump at the opportunity to do my bidding. Not that you know what that is like. Now go, see how you fare against the bull.
HadesAboutTheseus01|Hades About Theseus 01|Hades|How goes your heated rivalry against the greatest king of Athens lately, boy? Your battles with him and the Minotaur must be the talk of the Underworld of late.
HadesAboutTheseus01|Hades About Theseus 01|Zagreus|Admit it, Father. Theseus was the only hero you were able to recruit to stand against me. All the while he gets to boast about being the champion. What, was Heracles too busy for the task?
HadesAboutTheseus01|Hades About Theseus 01|Hades|Speak not to me of Heracles. You know these heroes by their deeds, not by their character. Heracles is fortunate he's in my brother's favor. Else he would be in Tartarus where he belongs. The mortal concept of what constitutes a hero is absurd.
HadesAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Hades About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Hades|I know what you did. Stay out of Nyx's affairs next time, boy. She is needed here! Not wallowing in the primordial dark.
HadesAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Hades About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|You're just angry because some of us still want to have anything to do with their parents.
HadesAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Hades About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Hades|Parents, *pah*! You know nothing of what parents are capable of. Conspire all you like against my wishes, I care not. Get out.
HadesRunCleared01|Hades Run Cleared 01|Hades|So you were able to dispatch my Hydra, boy. Right down to the last hateful head. It's an accomplishment I felt was certainly beyond your talent set. Though, here you are again, nevertheless.
HadesRunCleared01|Hades Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|You cheated me. There wasn't anywhere that I could go! I could have gone much farther. All the way to Mother!
HadesRunCleared01|Hades Run Cleared 01|Hades|You shall do no such thing. Besides, if you were any help to me, you'd know vast portions of my realm are presently still under renovation. You won't be getting farther than you have.
HadesRunCleared01|Hades Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|I can wait. You can't just keep this place on lockdown for eternity. The mortals up there wouldn't stand for it.
HadesRunCleared01|Hades Run Cleared 01|Hades|They have no patience, yes. The same as you. Then wait, with all the rest of them. It matters not to me. For I have other work to do.
HadesRunCleared01FollowUp|Hades Run Cleared 01 Follow Up|Hades|Now you begone from here, get yourself killed some more for all I care.
HadesRunCleared02|Hades Run Cleared 02|Hades|Well, boy. Word has reached me that you were able to dethrone the Champion of Elysium as well as his bull-headed companion. Tell me, how did you accomplish such a thing?
HadesRunCleared02|Hades Run Cleared 02|Zagreus|First, you tell me when I can get out of there. The path guarded by Theseus was sealed! Is there even a surface? Is the outside world all a lie?!
HadesRunCleared02|Hades Run Cleared 02|Hades|Ah, now you are asking the big questions! Comforting to see such growth of character. Well if there is an outside world, you shall not be seeing it for quite some time. You know why, don't you?
HadesRunCleared02|Hades Run Cleared 02|Zagreus|Ongoing Underworld renovations?
HadesRunCleared02|Hades Run Cleared 02|Hades|Ongoing Underworld renovations. Now go and let King Theseus drive that sharp spear of his into yourself some more, until such time. The mortals soon shall force me to reopen, and then what?
HadesRunCleared03|Hades Run Cleared 03|Hades|You are late, boy! Have you any idea what time it is?
HadesRunCleared03|Hades Run Cleared 03|Zagreus|No. Wait, what? I just vanquished you in single combat, and that's all you have to say to me?
HadesRunCleared03|Hades Run Cleared 03|Hades|Vanquished *me*? *Hah, hahaha*, nonsense. Don't you think I would recall such an event?
HadesRunCleared03|Hades Run Cleared 03|Zagreus|You can't be serious. You're going to pretend as though it never happened?
HadesRunCleared03|Hades Run Cleared 03|Hades|Everything is as it always was. And so shall it be, until the Fates determine otherwise. Or until our ongoing Underworld renovations are finally complete. Whichever comes first.
HadesRunCleared03_C|Hades Run Cleared 03 C|Zagreus|So you're really not going to answer my question about Mother from the other time, until the Underworld renovations are complete?
HadesRunCleared03_C|Hades Run Cleared 03 C|Hades|I know not what you're going on about, there, boy. Although, my focus is entirely upon our renovations, yes. Perhaps someday or night when this place is in proper working order, I shall have more time for your insipid questions.
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01|Hades|You are *late*, boy! Have you any idea what time it is?
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|No. Wait, what? I vanquished you in single combat and finally found Mother, and that's all you have to say to me?
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01|Hades|*Hah, haha*! Nonsense. Don't you think I would recall such an event?
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|You can't be serious. You're going to pretend as though it never happened? She wants answers, same as I do. She demands you let me pass! Let me go to her again.
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01|Hades|Silence! This discussion is over. I hardly think this is the time or place to indulge your overwrought imagination.
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01_B|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01 B|Hades|I told you, boy. I told you! There's no escape from here. Learned that the hard way, then?
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01_B|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01 B|Zagreus|You could have told me more important things. Mother left because she never even knew I was alive. Thanks to you! She's got a lot of questions, herself, as you can probably imagine. I'm headed back to her. You going to cooperate?
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01_B|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01 B|Hades|*Hahaha*, nonsense! Listen to me: If you have any sense remaining in that head of yours, I caution you not to discuss this here and now.
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting01_B|Hades After Persephone Meeting 01 B|Zagreus|Let me go. Let me find her. She demands it!
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting02|Hades After Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Quite a mess you've created, I must say, Father... after being of no help whatsoever when it comes to disentangling it all. Though, this isn't the place to talk, right?
HadesAfterPersephoneMeeting02|Hades After Persephone Meeting 02|Hades|No! It most certainly is not. Though, I take it it shall not be long before another of our private meetings, then.
HadesRunCleared03_B|Hades Run Cleared 03 B|Zagreus|Something the matter, there, Father? You seem a little quieter than usual. Dare I say even a little somber and remorseful, for some reason?
HadesRunCleared03_B|Hades Run Cleared 03 B|Hades|Silence, boy! And better yet, why don't you get out of my sight? I've more important things to do now than indulge your boastfulness. We'll have to catch up at some other place and time.
HadesAboutUnderworldRenovations01|Hades About Underworld Renovations 01|Zagreus|You know, Father, while I'm sure you don't appreciate all the distractions as of late, your ceaseless toil has had some noticeable effect. Is it my imagination, or are the ongoing Underworld renovations almost complete?
HadesAboutUnderworldRenovations01|Hades About Underworld Renovations 01|Hades|There you go, getting ahead of yourself, again. The final stages of renovation are some of the most vital! Second only to the initial planning. There's a great deal of important work ahead!
HadesAboutUnderworldRenovations01|Hades About Underworld Renovations 01|Zagreus|I wasn't saying it wasn't important, I was just saying maybe there's finally an end to it in sight. What are you going to do with all your spare time, then?
HadesAboutShrine01|Hades About Shrine 01|Zagreus|What's the giant pact posted out in the courtyard, Father? You offering me a job?
HadesAboutShrine01|Hades About Shrine 01|Hades|Perish the thought. It's so that all your toiling can be more painful, nothing more.
HadesAboutShrine01|Hades About Shrine 01|Zagreus|Why would I want my toiling to be more painful than it already is?
HadesAboutShrine01|Hades About Shrine 01|Hades|Who knows, boy, or better yet, who cares? To make the mortals up there worship you for all your labors? Go on, then, go get yourself dispatched some more, so I can make well certain that my realm can properly contain you.
HadesAboutBounties01|Hades About Bounties 01|Hades|My records indicate that you've collected earnings based on some of your accomplishments, there, boy. I suppose you need an income of your own, having decided to cut ties and all.
HadesAboutBounties01|Hades About Bounties 01|Zagreus|What, you mean the bounties that you've offered up to anybody capable of beating Meg and all your other guardians out there? Don't you think that puts a lot of undue pressure on them, knowing that you've turned them into targets?
HadesAboutBounties01|Hades About Bounties 01|Hades|They must do better than they have, else they shall be replaced. If they're to grow in their respective roles, they have to know their weaknesses. And so do I. That you collect the bounties for it matters not.
HadesAboutBounties01|Hades About Bounties 01|Zagreus|What about the bounties for vanquishing you? Who's your replacement going to be?

HadesAboutShrine02|Hades About Shrine 02|Zagreus|Saw your new Pact of Punishment out in the courtyard, Father. Impressed that you could find a parchment large enough to fit all the unpleasant stipulations. So you're taking even harsher measures to contain me?
HadesAboutShrine02|Hades About Shrine 02|Hades|Whether you consent to the terms of the Pact is entirely up to you, boy. But, in all your comings and goings, it is important that we have full knowledge of which property is being carried from the premises.
HadesShrineProgress01|Hades Shrine Progress 01|Hades|You've taken more advantage of the Pact of Punishment than I would have expected, boy. I almost wish to commend you for doing such a thing.
HadesShrineProgress01|Hades Shrine Progress 01|Zagreus|Almost? I've been rampaging through the worst your realm has to offer. Causing you untold inconvenience and likely a fortune in repair costs. I thought you'd be upset.
HadesShrineProgress01|Hades Shrine Progress 01|Hades|Upset? Heavens, no. Through your repeated bumbling, you have revealed a number of shortcomings in our operations, which my underlings are busy working to address.
HadesShrineProgress01|Hades Shrine Progress 01|Zagreus|You know you sound especially despicable when you say *underlings*, don't you?
HadesShrineProgress01|Hades Shrine Progress 01|Hades|Don't let me keep you any longer, boy, go forth! Try to escape again. You're helping make the Underworld a better place.
HadesShrineProgress02|Hades Shrine Progress 02|Hades|Explain to me something: How did you do it? I mean the Pact. For all of the conditions it imposed... you still surpassed me. How?
HadesShrineProgress02|Hades Shrine Progress 02|Zagreus|Plenty of practice, regular exercise, a positive attitude, the blessings of assorted family members you don't like, and your discarded Titan-slaying weapons I suppose. Nothing special. Why do you ask?
HadesShrineProgress02|Hades Shrine Progress 02|Hades|To think that you would squander such a talent on frivolous pursuit. You do not even realize what you have achieved, do you.
HadesShrineProgress02|Hades Shrine Progress 02|Zagreus|Wait, wait wait wait wait, care to repeat that first part that you said back there? The *talent *part?
HadesShrineProgress02|Hades Shrine Progress 02|Hades|Would that you had a talent for listening. Begone for now.
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures01|Hades About Extreme Measures 01|Hades|Back to your senses, then, boy? The Pact of Punishment is not something one ought to trifle with unknowingly, in case you've yet to notice.
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures01|Hades About Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|Father... the Pact... you were so blasted strong. I had no idea! All those other times we fought... I can't believe that you were holding back. You were desperate to stop me, you could have!
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures01|Hades About Extreme Measures 01|Hades|We are bound by the Fates to this realm. It is ours, and we belong to it, in turn. And... I did not hold back against you. Rather... I had forgotten my old strength. Some of it since returned to me.
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures01|Hades About Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|Must have been all our vicious battles to the death? Or maybe it's from Mother being back in your life?
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures01|Hades About Extreme Measures 01|Hades|Pointless to even ask. What motivates us is a complicated thing. But if you long to face me with the power I once held during my own youth... you have available to you the means.
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures02|Hades About Extreme Measures 02|Hades|*Urgh*... come, get your gloating well out of the way, so I can get back to this parchmentwork. It piled up, in my prolonged absence!
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures02|Hades About Extreme Measures 02|Zagreus|Not here to gloat, Father. Well fought back there. I can't believe I got you.
HadesAboutExtremeMeasures02|Hades About Extreme Measures 02|Hades|...Nor I. Next time, the Fates may not decide to favor you like that. If there shall be a next time.
HadesAboutZeus01|Hades About Zeus 01|Zagreus|Father... look, Lord Uncle Zeus, I've been in contact with him, and he wishes to make peace. He asked for me to tell you. To tell you he forgives you for... whatever happened.
HadesAboutZeus01|Hades About Zeus 01|Hades|My brother Zeus... forgives me? Zeus forgives *me*?! How dare that blasted little brat! His beard may be luxurious but he's as much a child as are you. Forgives me, bah!
HadesAboutZeus01|Hades About Zeus 01|Zagreus|What did you do...? What happened between you?
HadesAboutZeus01|Hades About Zeus 01|Hades|None of your business! Go on now and frolic with that Lord Uncle of yours, the both of them! And don't you ever speak of him to me again, you hear me?
HadesAboutPersephone01|Hades About Persephone 01|Zagreus|Question for you, Father. The name *Kore *happen to mean anything to you, by any chance?
HadesAboutPersephone01|Hades About Persephone 01|Hades|*What*, where did you...?! *Ahh*, the cold witch brought it up, did she? Never repeat that name again, not here, nor anywhere, you hear me, boy? Know only this: The one called by that name despised it even more than I.
HadesAboutPersephone01|Hades About Persephone 01|Zagreus|So let's see. Demeter's daughter went missing. She wound up down here. I... happened. Mother left. Demeter, and everyone else on Olympus apparently, has no idea. That about right? Tell me what happened.
HadesAboutPersephone01|Hades About Persephone 01|Hades|I'll tell you nothing! Keep meddling in matters that you cannot understand, and you'll incur the wrath of Olympus on all that you hold dear. And, know that it is not for *my *sake that I'm warning you.
HadesAboutPersephone02|Hades About Persephone 02|Hades|What is it now? I see that sneering look upon your countenance, which must mean you have yet another one of your insipid questions, haven't you.
HadesAboutPersephone02|Hades About Persephone 02|Zagreus|Oh, this one's not insipid in the slightest. Let me get this straight. My mother's Persephone. Her mother's Demeter, but her father... evidently was some farm-boy? My red blood comes from him? And my propensity to die I guess.
HadesAboutPersephone02|Hades About Persephone 02|Hades|You blame your ancestors for your own weakness? You should be thankful you were born with immortality! Though, your meddlesome curiosity and constant need for affirmation must certainly be from your mortal side.
HadesAboutPersephone02|Hades About Persephone 02|Zagreus|Then, Mother, did... she grow older with age? Is she just going to expire as the mortals do? With demigods I hear it can go either way.
HadesAboutPersephone02|Hades About Persephone 02|Hades|I said never to speak of her, blast you! You said, yourself, she is the daughter of the goddess of seasons! Use your fool head, for once.
HadesAboutDemeter01|Hades About Demeter 01|Zagreus|Greetings, Father. Ran into Lady Demeter out there, on my last outing. Or should I say, my grandmother? What's she to you, then, ex-mother-in-law? Source of abject terror? Hard keeping track. Our family's rather complicated.
HadesAboutDemeter01|Hades About Demeter 01|Hades|Do not invoke her name inside my House, you hear me, boy? You do not know at all what she is like. Though I can see why you two hit it off. She hated her father. Though understandably, as he was worse even than mine. Even than yours.
HadesPostEnding01|Hades Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Greetings, Father. So! I can just... head on out there again whenever I want? Don't need to stick to any rigid schedule?
HadesPostEnding01|Hades Post Ending 01|Hades|Your unpredictability is one of your assets. Our defenses must always be on guard. So, yes: Go about your business as you best see fit!
HadesPostEnding01|Hades Post Ending 01|Zagreus|And the Olympians are going to keep helping me, thinking I'm trying to get away from you, to *them*. We can't keep this up with them forever, you know.
HadesPostEnding02|Hades Post Ending 02|Hades|Tell me something, boy... Zagreus... why did you do all this? Return the Queen. Go to such lengths. At a certain point... you must have learned the way I felt about her. Yet still you persisted. If I were you... I'd not have done me any favors.
HadesPostEnding02|Hades Post Ending 02|Zagreus|I didn't often stop to give it much thought. I just knew I needed to find her... and then as soon as I did, I knew I needed her in my life. In other words, doing you any favors was never a priority, Father. Just ended up that way, I guess.
HadesPostEnding02|Hades Post Ending 02|Hades|...I see. I appreciate your candor. Nevertheless... I thank you. I do not know how you accomplished what you did, but know that I am grateful for the outcome. Even if I fail to act like it, much of the time.
HadesPostEnding03|Hades Post Ending 03|Zagreus|Say, Father... back when you drew lots with your brothers, and wound up with the Underworld, rather than the heavens or the seas... which would you have claimed, if the choice was yours?
HadesPostEnding03|Hades Post Ending 03|Hades|I do not deal in hypotheticals, boy. Each realm has its host of unenviable problems. You have never experienced the cold and sopping sea, or the blinding heights of Olympus. I have. And I assure you, you're not missing much.
HadesPostEnding03|Hades Post Ending 03|Zagreus|Didn't you try to leave the Underworld, yourself, at some point? You once gave me that impression. I always thought it was because you hated it here.
HadesPostEnding03|Hades Post Ending 03|Hades|I hate not having any choice. Enjoy the freedoms that you have. As you grow long in years, you gain more burdens and responsibilities, until they bind you.
HadesPostEnding04|Hades Post Ending 04|Zagreus|Father, all these shades... aren't they going to let on that Mother's back? What if word spreads... and the Olympians find out?
HadesPostEnding04|Hades Post Ending 04|Hades|You are so well-accustomed to defying me that you forget there are no others, either living or dead, who would so dare. *None *in this House shall speak of this until we are prepared to make any announcements, on our own terms.
HadesRevealsBadgeSeller01|Hades Reveals Badge Seller 01|Hades|Regarding your responsibilities: Our Resources Director is available to you. In my private quarters. Normally, it would be I, alone, transferring excess resources back into our realm.
HadesRevealsBadgeSeller01|Hades Reveals Badge Seller 01|Zagreus|The fabled Resources Director! So, now I get to give away the hard-earned resources I've painstakingly gathered over time?

HadesAboutBadgeSellerProgress02|Hades About Badge Seller Progress 02|Hades|You are advancing through the ranks of your position, and returning to our realm the vast resources you have claimed. As well you ought. Carry on.
HadesAboutBadgeSellerProgress03|Hades About Badge Seller Progress 03|Hades|We cannot speak of this, except... *Unseen One*... the highest ranking that we can bestow. I never once imagined that you could achieve that rank, yourself. Or any rank of note.
HadesAboutBadgeSellerProgress03|Hades About Badge Seller Progress 03|Zagreus|You always thought too little of me, Father. Though, thank you for taking note of that. I figured I ought to give back to the realm that made me what I am.
HadesAboutBadgeSellerProgress03|Hades About Badge Seller Progress 03|Hades|Yes. For this is the only world we know.
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Zagreus|Father... all this stuff with the Olympians... will you just tell me what's going on, for once? How did Mother come to join you here? What's your problem with Uncle Zeus?
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Hades|I thought she already told you...! *Urgh*. Come with me. Now.
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Hades|...Swear to me that you shall never repeat what you are about to hear. Swear it!
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Zagreus|All right, all right, I swear. I swear, in your own name, I'll keep what you're about to say between us.... So?
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Hades|So... you had it mostly right, before. After I inherited the Underworld... your Uncle Zeus felt sympathy for me, he says. Your mother, he knew she was unhappy on Olympus. And... he knew I was drawn to her. So what did he do? He brought her here. Gave her to me as a *gift*!
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Zagreus|You weren't expecting a gift like that. But she didn't want to return to Olympus, and you liked her, so you didn't send her away. And you're angry with Zeus for putting you in that position? Cut ties with him?
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Hades|*Yes*!! The blasted fool, with all his flights of fancy! He does whatever he wants! He could have achieved a similar outcome in a limitless number of reasonable ways... rather than resort to what was tantamount to kidnapping! Even *if *she wanted to leave!
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Zagreus|And now if Demeter and the others found all this out, you and Mother... even Zeus would be in a bad spot, wouldn't he? He must have a temper on him to match yours.
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01A|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A|Hades|You know nothing of tempers if mine is your frame of reference, Zagreus. Now, enough of this! You know the rest. Remember your oath.
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Hades|One thing, before you depart again, boy. Until the Queen's intentions with Olympus come to pass... not a word to anyone about her presence, here. Do you understand?
HadesAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|I do. But she won't have to hide forever.
HadesPostEpilogue01|Hades Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|So, now that the festivities are over with, it's back to work like this, the same as ever?
HadesPostEpilogue01|Hades Post Epilogue 01|Hades|Do you have any idea what happens when you announce the Underworld has a Queen, boy? *Urgh, damn it*! *Zagreus*, I mean. You become inundated with well-wishes from every blasted shade that wants something.
HadesPostEpilogue01|Hades Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|You're responding to well-wishes? *Aw. *Don't you think some of your subjects are sincerely happy for you?
HadesPostEpilogue02|Hades Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|I never stopped to think about why pomegranates grew here in the Underworld. Mother's doing from before, then? And all that stuff she told the Olympians, about how they bind you to this place... it's all nonsense?
HadesPostEpilogue02|Hades Post Epilogue 02|Hades|You know full well that the pomegranates in my realm hold a certain power beyond the tartness of their taste, boy. The Queen... she has a way with plants, you see. A bit of her own mother's gift, applied more sensibly.
HadesPostEpilogue02|Hades Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|You kept them growing all this time... flourishing, even, because of her.
HadesPostEpilogue03A|Hades Post Epilogue 03 A|Zagreus|So, what happened, when Mother first arrived, if I may ask? Some of your residents seem to remember the Queen from before. Yet the Olympians just never found out?
HadesPostEpilogue03A|Hades Post Epilogue 03 A|Hades|They had no jurisdiction here. No knowledge of our goings-on. Well, Hermes did, perhaps, but in a very limited capacity. As far as anybody knew beyond this realm... our Queen was Nyx. Ask nothing more of this.
HadesAboutPersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Hades About Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|Father... how are you doing without Mother around? Will she be all right, on Olympus?
HadesAboutPersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Hades About Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Hades|Clearly she is more than capable of handling herself. And we here have been well accustomed to not having her about.
HadesAboutPersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Hades About Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|So everything's back to normal, then? That sounds lovely.
HadesAboutPersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Hades About Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Hades|Nothing is normal, anymore. Besides! She shall return. Knowing that she shall return, is that not sufficient for you? Be patient, for once.
HadesAboutPersephoneReturnsFromOlympus01|Hades About Persephone Returns From Olympus 01|Zagreus|It's good to see Mother's back. Not that I was too concerned, but... I was definitely a little concerned.
HadesAboutPersephoneReturnsFromOlympus01|Hades About Persephone Returns From Olympus 01|Hades|I shared in that particular concern, and yes... it is good the Queen has once again returned. And she shall have to depart again before we know it, so cherish your time with her, boy!
HadesPostEpilogue03|Hades Post Epilogue 03|Hades|Tell me, in brief, boy. Our own upon Olympus... are they continuing to aid you as expected?
HadesPostEpilogue03|Hades Post Epilogue 03|Zagreus|Still showing up and lending their support. I think some of them are a little disappointed I'm not planning to come join them, though... I think they understand now that they owe the Underworld a debt. We all have to do our part, looking after the mortals. Whether alive or dead.
HadesPostEpilogue03|Hades Post Epilogue 03|Hades|Indeed. I half-expected they would disappoint. Abandon you to toil on your own. At least thus far they've honored their commitment, then.
HadesPostEpilogue04|Hades Post Epilogue 04|Zagreus|So, are you maintaining better contact now with Uncle Zeus, Uncle Poseidon, and the rest? Oh, and... is it all right for me to speak about them here?
HadesPostEpilogue04|Hades Post Epilogue 04|Hades|*Urgh*... I'm certain the superficial messages we have exchanged shall taper off, with time. We have always been apart, irrespective of the distance separating us. I know Zeus is content with your mother's version of events. Thus we are at peace, for now.
HadesPostEpilogue04|Hades Post Epilogue 04|Zagreus|Wait, what do you mean, *for now*?
HadesPostEpilogue04|Hades Post Epilogue 04|Hades|I mean only that our family is prone to causing problems for itself. Never content to leave things well enough alone. But if we have little to do with them... their quarrels, all their nonsense on Olympus... it should be of no consequence.
HadesPostEpilogue05|Hades Post Epilogue 05|Hades|The latest reports indicate that mortals are fully twice as fearful of ending up in Tartarus as in our last evaluation period, thanks to the destruction you have caused. You are an unseen power in the Underworld. Commendable.
HadesPostEpilogue05|Hades Post Epilogue 05|Zagreus|Commendable, me? An *unseen power*, huh. Surprised you're giving me the credit, Father.
HadesPostEpilogue05|Hades Post Epilogue 05|Hades|I give credit where it's due. But the mortals? They know nothing of what transpires here. Only rumblings we permit to escape our realm... rumblings that reinforce their deepest fears about what shall transpire after their demise.
HadesPostEpilogue05|Hades Post Epilogue 05|Zagreus|So the more havoc I wreak in the Underworld, the more mortals hear about all the unpleasantness, and... it makes them fearful of this place? If more of them lead upstanding lives, it'll keep Tartarus from overflowing, I guess.
HadesChat01|Hades Chat 01|Hades|Whatever you may wish to say, I do not wish to hear it.
HadesChat02|Hades Chat 02|Hades|You're interrupting me during my time at work.
HadesChat03|Hades Chat 03|Hades|I think I've heard more than enough from you lately.
HadesChat04|Hades Chat 04|Hades|You're willfully wasting my time, aren't you.
HadesChat05|Hades Chat 05|Hades|Go, get out. Don't let me stop you.
HadesChat06|Hades Chat 06|Hades|Shouldn't you be getting skewered by the dead?
HadesChat07|Hades Chat 07|Hades|Go to your room, or anywhere but here.
HadesChat08|Hades Chat 08|Hades|Blood and darkness, what is it with you?
HadesChat09|Hades Chat 09|Hades|Have you come up with more impertinence to spout at me?
HadesChat10|Hades Chat 10|Hades|I'll not be bothered with your disrespect.
HadesChat11|Hades Chat 11|Hades|Has it occurred to you that I'm preoccupied?
HadesChat12|Hades Chat 12|Hades|I am uninterested in conversing with you, boy.
HadesChat13|Hades Chat 13|Hades|Your presence is no longer welcome here.
HadesChat14|Hades Chat 14|Hades|How possibly could I have given the impression that I wished to talk?
HadesChat15|Hades Chat 15|Hades|You realize just how much property of mine you have defaced?
HadesChat16|Hades Chat 16|Hades|Fail all you like, you're never getting out of here.
HadesChat17|Hades Chat 17|Hades|You'll learn your place, the hard way, evidently.
HadesChat18|Hades Chat 18|Hades|To suffer such indignity, from my own kin.
HadesChat19|Hades Chat 19|Hades|Such foolishness as yours I scarce can comprehend.
HadesChat20|Hades Chat 20|Hades|We've nothing left now to discuss between us.
HadesChat22|Hades Chat 22|Hades|Have I mentioned that you're never getting out of here?
HadesChat23|Hades Chat 23|Hades|You're here to stay, boy. All of us are.
HadesChat24|Hades Chat 24|Hades|I'm busy now, as you can plainly see.
HadesPostEndingChat01|Hades Post Ending Chat 01|Hades|Blasted parchmentwork, it never goes away.
HadesPostEndingChat02|Hades Post Ending Chat 02|Hades|Your recent efforts have proved useful to this place.
HadesPostEndingChat03|Hades Post Ending Chat 03|Hades|Go instill some fear in those wretches out there, would you?
HadesPostEndingChat04|Hades Post Ending Chat 04|Hades|He's back again, Cerberus! I'll try not to keep him for as long, next time.
HadesPostEndingChat05|Hades Post Ending Chat 05|Hades|Doubtless I shall get you for that one next time.
HadesPostEndingChat06|Hades Post Ending Chat 06|Hades|Another satyr outbreak to look out for next you venture there...
HadesPostEndingChat07|Hades Post Ending Chat 07|Hades|Be certain to give your regards to your mother as well!
HadesPostEndingChat08|Hades Post Ending Chat 08|Hades|Repairs for all the carnage that you sowed are already underway.
HadesPostEndingChat09|Hades Post Ending Chat 09|Hades|What else can we do to contain you, I wonder...
HadesPostEndingChat10|Hades Post Ending Chat 10|Hades|I have some catching up to do, as you can see.
HadesPostEndingChat11|Hades Post Ending Chat 11|Hades|Ah, we ought to reconvene the court now, I suppose.
HadesPostEndingChat12|Hades Post Ending Chat 12|Hades|As you can see, I must attend to all this parchmentwork.
HadesPostEndingChat13|Hades Post Ending Chat 13|Hades|I must say, you made a hollow mockery of Theseus that time.
HadesPostEndingChat14|Hades Post Ending Chat 14|Hades|Our security efforts in Asphodel are evidently lacking.
HadesPostEndingChat15|Hades Post Ending Chat 15|Hades|Go rest yourself if need be. Though the Underworld is ready when you are.
HadesPostEndingChat16|Hades Post Ending Chat 16|Hades|Against my better judgment, I went easier on you that time.
HadesPostEndingChat17|Hades Post Ending Chat 17|Hades|Thus starts and ends our brief exchange of pleasantries.
HadesPostEndingChat18|Hades Post Ending Chat 18|Hades|Continue to perform your duties as you have.
HadesPostEndingChat19|Hades Post Ending Chat 19|Hades|Cerberus there was anticipating your return.
HadesPostEndingChat20|Hades Post Ending Chat 20|Hades|Your mother expected this most recent result of yours.
HadesPostEndingChat21|Hades Post Ending Chat 21|Hades|Do I appear as though I've time for conversation, boy?
HadesPostEndingChat22|Hades Post Ending Chat 22|Hades|Let us discuss your work performance at some other time.
HadesPostEndingChat23|Hades Post Ending Chat 23|Hades|Your infamy throughout Elysium has only grown.
HadesPostEndingChat24|Hades Post Ending Chat 24|Hades|I must admit... that was a job well done back there.
HadesGift01|Hades Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey, uh, Father. I thought, maybe, you know, here.
HadesGift01|Hades Gift 01|Hades|Where did you get this...? You think you can butter me up with such trifles? Give me that, and then get out of here.
HadesGift01_B|Hades Gift 01 B|Zagreus|Hey, uh, Father. I thought, maybe, you know, here.
HadesGift01_B|Hades Gift 01 B|Hades|You owe me nothing, certainly not this. And I've nothing to give you in exchange. But fine, I'll honor our custom. Give it here.
HadesGift02|Hades Gift 02|Zagreus|*Erm*, Father... I know we can't exactly change the past, but we can try to move forward. Look, I know I'm not even supposed to have this stuff, but everyone likes it, won't you try it, at least? Here, take it, either way.
HadesGift02|Hades Gift 02|Hades|*Hrm*. I... can dispose of this properly. Speaking of disposal... I've no further need for this, here, so... rid me of it, why don't you? On your way out.
HadesGift03|Hades Gift 03|Zagreus|More Nectar for the old disposal service, Father, if you don't mind. Come on, you must have tried the stuff, at least in the days before you were here! Didn't you ever enjoy yourself, at any point?
HadesGift03|Hades Gift 03|Hades|I don't require beverages in order to enjoy myself, boy. Unlike so many of your kin upon their mountain. Yet this blasted substance somehow finds its way to my domain. Then, fine! You wish for the customs here to be more akin to Olympus, why not?
HadesGift04|Hades Gift 04|Zagreus|Have another bottle, why don't you, Father? Not like it's going to change anything between us, right? All the Nectar in the Underworld can't change what's already happened. Or change yourself.
HadesGift04|Hades Gift 04|Hades|*Hrm*. You're probably correct. You must think it is my age that makes me obstinate. Unable to change my nature. But I have always been inflexible. You think I'm proud of it? You call me *'Father' *like it's an insult. I deserve the title only as a technicality, I know.
HadesGift04|Hades Gift 04|Zagreus|You could start being a better father at any point. There's no one stopping you but you.
HadesGift04|Hades Gift 04|Hades|Yes, well... unfortunately, I am a significant impediment. You should be well aware of that. *You *were able to stop me. I have thus far been unable to do so...
HadesGift05|Hades Gift 05|Hades|Enough of this, boy! Even mortals know better. I don't want your Nectar, or Ambrosia, or whichever offerings. You owe me no such thing, and I shall not accept it any longer. In fact, here... you shall take all of it back!
HadesGift05|Hades Gift 05|Zagreus|Why? It's just Nectar, Father, lighten up. I get that you're surly about everything, but please at least try toward decency with me! If not for me, then for Mother.
HadesGift05|Hades Gift 05|Hades|How dare you lecture me? I mean... *urgh*... look. As you told me yourself... there's no changing what already transpired. And our memories are warnings. When you have lived as long as I have... you come to understand your weaknesses.
HadesGift05|Hades Gift 05|Zagreus|What are you getting at? You're just going to give up, stick with what's comfortable for you instead of making any real effort at making peace with your son?
HadesGift05|Hades Gift 05|Hades|*Rngh*. Listen to me. My attempts at making peace are going to be rather subtle for your tastes. I cannot change the past. And there is only so much I can do about the future. I tell you this because... I shall not lie to you again. That much, I swear.
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_01|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 01|Hades|Well? What is the latest explanation for your tardiness? Lost track of time admiring the courtyard view? Perhaps you were recuperating from your martial training. Achilles is not prone to holding back.
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_01|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 01|Zagreus|I... I'm sorry, Father, I just overslept. I must have overslept. How am I even supposed to know exactly when to be here, I mean, every moment every day and night, here, it's all the same!
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_01|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 01|Hades|It's *not *at all the same! The hue of Ixion's green light takes on an obviously lighter hue when it is time! You're an embarrassment not just to me, here, boy, but to this entire operation. Now get back to work!
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_02|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 02|Hades|Not only were you late, again... but then you also failed to perform even the simplest tasks that I had asked, repeatedly, that you complete. How many chances do you need at this? I am too lenient with you.
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_02|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 02|Zagreus|Too lenient? Instead of lambasting me nonstop, have you considered, maybe, training me some more to do this fascinating work to your satisfaction? You'll forgive me if I didn't memorize every laborious detail the last time you performed your monologue about how all this works.
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_02|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 02|Hades|*Excuse me*?! If I am not mistaken, you're deflecting your incompetence toward *me*? As though the Goddess of Wisdom herself has come to aid you in your time of need! I could replace you here and now with any number of simple shades, hungry to work here!
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_02|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 02|Zagreus|Then why don't you?! I don't want any of this. I'm not the one who drew the short lot with your brothers and got stuck here forever!! Why am I having to do this senseless parchment-pushing for you?
Hades_Flashback_DayNightJob_02|Hades Flashback Day Night Job 02|Hades|Why are you stuck? You're not. You're *fired*! I was wrong to think you were prepared to take on any responsibility at all. And, don't you ever invoke your uncles here again. Or I'll have you cast into the lowest pits of Tartarus. Now, get out of my administration, and my sight!
CerberusMiscMeeting01|Cerberus Misc Meeting 01|Storyteller|*Infernal watch-dog Cerberus regards the Underworld Prince with mixed emotions, from purest joy to deepest melancholy.*
CerberusMiscMeeting01|Cerberus Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|You watch over things for me, won't you, boy? You know I'd take you if I could.
CerberusMiscMeeting02|Cerberus Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|How you holding up, boy, eating well lately? All three mouths full and happy?
CerberusMiscMeeting02|Cerberus Misc Meeting 02|Storyteller|*Each terrifying maw of the infernal watch-dog Cerberus responds affirmatively, one after the next, as if to reassure the ever-doubting Prince.*
CerberusMiscMeeting03|Cerberus Misc Meeting 03|Zagreus|Take it easy, boy. I'll probably be back here in no time.
CerberusMiscMeeting03|Cerberus Misc Meeting 03|Storyteller|*The watch-dog Cerberus merely sulks upon his supple bedroll.*
CerberusMiscMeeting04|Cerberus Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|You keep an eye on Father for me, boy. Don't let him sour up everyone's mood.
CerberusMiscMeeting04|Cerberus Misc Meeting 04|Storyteller|*Cerberus promises to do exactly that, in his own way.*
CerberusMiscMeeting05|Cerberus Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|How's everything been going lately, boy? What's the good word?
CerberusMiscMeeting05|Cerberus Misc Meeting 05|Storyteller|*The Underworld Prince's casual inquiry serves but to frustrate the infernal hound, as none of his three heads possess the gift and curse of speech.*
CerberusRunProgress01|Cerberus Run Progress 01|Zagreus|Hey, boy, just me again. Here to report it's pretty dangerous out there even without you on guard duty all the time.
CerberusRunProgress01|Cerberus Run Progress 01|Storyteller|*The venerable hound of hell barely acknowledges the softly-spoken Prince's platitude, knowing full well the Underworld is not as vigilantly guarded as in ages past.*
CerberusRunProgress02|Cerberus Run Progress 02|Zagreus|Guess what, boy? Made it all the way to Asphodel last time! I fully understand how come you never liked it there. Now to trek on back, I guess. Take care!
CerberusRunProgress02|Cerberus Run Progress 02|Storyteller|*Despite the Underworld Prince's optimism, his old companion Cerberus, the multi-headed hound, maintains a somewhat sulky attitude for now.*
CerberusRunProgress03|Cerberus Run Progress 03|Zagreus|Hey good to see you back here, boy. I'm glad you're back on guard duty! Even if it means having to find a way past you. I know you're just doing your job.
CerberusRunProgress03|Cerberus Run Progress 03|Storyteller|*The fear-inducing hellhound eyes the Underworld Prince uneasily, his six ferocious eyes each glistening within the dim light of the House.*
CerberusAboutFastTravel01|Cerberus About Fast Travel 01|Zagreus|I hope I haven't been inconveniencing you too much with all the visits to the Temple lately, boy. Say, how do you get back? Charon giving you a lift?
CerberusAboutFastTravel01|Cerberus About Fast Travel 01|Storyteller|*Thus asks the Prince his question of the guardian of the gates of hell, knowing full well the multi-headed monster keeps a wide berth of the river-boatman, as do all with any sense.*
CerberusAboutBall01|Cerberus About Ball 01|Zagreus|Enjoying staring at that ball I got you, boy? No fun if it doesn't fight back, huh...
CerberusAboutBall01|Cerberus About Ball 01|Storyteller|*The hell-forged multi-headed monster feels no urgency to waste his precious time on simple play-things, much preferring to conserve his vast energy reserves in case any trespassers need to be eaten suddenly.*
CerberusLoungeClosed01|Cerberus Lounge Closed 01|Zagreus|You really ripped the lounge to pieces, boy? I hope you didn't get yourself in too much trouble. I'm sorry to have worried you like that.
CerberusLoungeClosed01|Cerberus Lounge Closed 01|Storyteller|*The guilt-wracked monster Cerberus admits to committing the crime, expressing some remorse for having implicated the incendiary Prince.*
CerberusLoungeOpen01|Cerberus Lounge Open 01|Zagreus|Hey, did you see, boy? The old lounge is good as new again, you ought to check it out! Just, don't annihilate it like you did last time.
CerberusLoungeOpen01|Cerberus Lounge Open 01|Storyteller|*Each savage countenance of Cerberus lights up to hear the news, doubtless beginning to assemble stratagems for ravaging the lounging area once more.*
CerberusAboutUnderworldRenovations01|Cerberus About Underworld Renovations 01|Zagreus|Hey, boy. I hope all the construction and renovation around here hasn't been too inconvenient for you, lately. But hey, the lounge is just about ready for you to utterly destroy again!
CerberusAboutUnderworldRenovations01|Cerberus About Underworld Renovations 01|Storyteller|*Prince Zagreus implants in the impressionable, vicious watchdog of the Underworld a new appetite for more destruction, to be sated in another age.*
CerberusAboutBeingBestBoy01|Cerberus About Being Best Boy 01|Zagreus|You know, after dying in some wretched manner, giving pets to my good boy sure helps me get back on my feet. Thanks for being here for me.
CerberusAboutBeingBestBoy01|Cerberus About Being Best Boy 01|Storyteller|*The burning embers in the eyes of monstrous Cerberus, notorious hound of hell, reveal that he, too, is amenable to the pets of which the Underworld Prince speaks, and in fact is deeply grateful for the quantity of them.*
CerberusAboutPersephone01|Cerberus About Persephone 01|Zagreus|I found her, boy! My mother! Persephone, you remember her, don't you? She was pleased to hear about you. But I couldn't stay for long, and I have to find her again, so... guess I'll see you at the Temple, then?
CerberusAboutPersephone01|Cerberus About Persephone 01|Storyteller|*The ghoulish features of the much-reviled hound of hell all soften instantly upon the mention of a certain name; briefly, then, the monster is at peace.*
CerberusPostEnding01|Cerberus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Well, look at you, boy! Never seen you quite so perky, relatively speaking of course, big tough guy like yourself. You must have missed Mother just as much as she missed you. Well, you've got plenty of time for catching up on things, now!
CerberusPostEnding01|Cerberus Post Ending 01|Storyteller|*The monstrous triple-headed beast of Hades would perhaps be overcome with pure emotion by the joyous circumstances, were he only capable of this.*
CerberusPostEnding02|Cerberus Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Bet you're happy to see Mother home again, huh, boy? Only wish you could have told me about her before.
CerberusPostEnding02|Cerberus Post Ending 02|Storyteller|*The hell-born monster Cerberus contentedly ignores the Prince's callous, inconsiderate remark.*

CerberusPostEpilogue01|Cerberus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|We're all very proud of you, boy! You were so well-behaved at the feast.

CerberusGift01|Cerberus Gift 01|Storyteller|*As one of Cerberus' heads receives the Prince's gift, another muzzles something back into his hand.*
CerberusGift02|Cerberus Gift 02|Zagreus|There's a good boy... thought you'd like that!
CerberusGift02|Cerberus Gift 02|Storyteller|*Cerberus is overjoyed to have received such a delicious treat.*
CerberusGift03|Cerberus Gift 03|Zagreus|Only the very best treats for my best friend, right, boy?
CerberusGift03|Cerberus Gift 03|Storyteller|*Cerberus yawlps in merriment upon receiving such a generous offering.*
CerberusGift04|Cerberus Gift 04|Zagreus|It is my humble duty to oblige my favorite boy with all the treats as I am able to procure.
CerberusGift04|Cerberus Gift 04|Storyteller|*Knowing the watch-dog's never-ending appetite for treats, the Prince obliges him.*
CerberusGift05|Cerberus Gift 05|Zagreus|You like this stuff, don't you, boy? Well, good, because I like sneaking it over to you!
CerberusGift05|Cerberus Gift 05|Storyteller|*The delectable taste of Nectar is enough to briefly sate even the ferocious appetite of the hound of hell.*
CerberusGift06|Cerberus Gift 06|Zagreus|This Nectar not fancy enough for you, boy, is that it? You've developed quite the delicate palate at your distinguished age!
CerberusGift06|Cerberus Gift 06|Storyteller|*Though having little appetite remaining for the lightness of Nectar's flavor, the multi-headed monster of the Underworld nevertheless accepts.*
CerberusGift07|Cerberus Gift 07|Zagreus|That's right, boy... Ambrosia, just for you. You're going to love it. Pretty much every creature, living or dead, does!
CerberusGift07|Cerberus Gift 07|Storyteller|*The six eyes of the hideous hound of hell go wide at once from having received the exquisite gift of rare Olympian Ambrosia. The creature is rather beside himself.*
CerberusGift08|Cerberus Gift 08|Zagreus|Hits the spot, doesn't it, boy? I know you're caught up in the middle of all this and having to weigh your loyalties more than you'd like. I'm sorry we're putting you through this.
CerberusGift08|Cerberus Gift 08|Storyteller|*The Underworld Prince's next attempt to bribe the monstrous triple-headed hellhound into further liking him proves once again successful, as the kingly gift of heavenly Ambrosia is beyond compare.*
CerberusGift09|Cerberus Gift 09|Zagreus|Cerberus, not to get all sentimental on you, but... oh, who am I kidding, look... you've been with me my entire life! I know you're here at home partly because of me, aren't you?
CerberusGift09|Cerberus Gift 09|Storyteller|*The bond between a hound and its master is as hard as adamant. Cerberus, the fearsome monster born of hell, and guardian of its gates, answers firstly to the Prince's father. But it turns out, the Prince may be the next best thing.*
CerberusGift09|Cerberus Gift 09|Zagreus|You're the best boy in the whole world. Even if heads Beta and Gamma don't much care for pets, do they? I've got more than enough lined up for you, though. Count on it.
CerberusStyxMeeting01|Cerberus Styx Meeting 01|Storyteller|*The multi-headed Cerberus stands vigilant before the Underworld's entryway; the tales of what happens to those foolish enough to attempt to pass are far too graphic to describe.*
CerberusStyxMeeting01|Cerberus Styx Meeting 01|Zagreus|So it's really come to this, boy? After everything we've been through. Well then, if this is how it has to be, there's nothing left to say. Except for: *On your guard*!!
CerberusStyxMeeting01|Cerberus Styx Meeting 01|Zagreus|*Hahaha*, no, but seriously, boy. I know why you're here. There has to be a way to make you look the other way. What if I help you with the Satyr problem, would you let me go? Please. I have to find Persephone... my mother. You know what this means to me.
CerberusStyxMeeting01|Cerberus Styx Meeting 01|Storyteller|*After a moment's hesitation and deliberation, the voracious hound of hell barks once, affirmatively, toward the Prince, who sets off in search of something that can sate the monster's appetites.*
CerberusBossDoorUnlock01|Cerberus Boss Door Unlock 01|Zagreus|All right, boy, I got your favorite treat. But you have to promise to let me pass if I hand it over, OK?

AchillesFirstMeeting|Achilles First Meeting|Scratch|Good to see you, lad, despite the circumstances. Remember your training out there. The pain of death is but another obstacle.
AchillesFirstMeeting|Achilles First Meeting|Zagreus|And fear is for the weak. Take care, Achilles.
AchillesFirstMeeting_Alt|Achilles First Meeting Alt|Achilles|Good to see you, lad. You've been awful busy as of late, there, haven't you? Let me know if there's something I can do, though from what I can tell, you've had a pretty good handle on it.
AchillesGrantsCodex|Achilles Grants Codex|Achilles|You'll get the hang of it out there, lad. For all our sparring practice, there's no teacher like the real thing. Now then, I have something for you.
AchillesGrantsCodex|Achilles Grants Codex|Zagreus|What, wait, you're giving me your Codex? I can't accept something like this!
AchillesGrantsCodex|Achilles Grants Codex|Achilles|Please, I insist. I want your love of history to grow, not just your love of warfare. Besides, maybe you can finish out the rest of it.
AchillesLoungeClosed01|Achilles Lounge Closed 01|Zagreus|Achilles, is it really true that Cerberus ripped the lounge up right after I left? He must have gotten in a lot of trouble.
AchillesLoungeClosed01|Achilles Lounge Closed 01|Achilles|I only wish you could have seen it, lad. The place looked like a vineyard after a typhoon! Your lord father was livid. But he never gets so angry with the dog. Poor Dusa, though, she's picking the place up.
AchillesLoungeClosed01|Achilles Lounge Closed 01|Zagreus|Oh, no... I wondered what became of Dusa. She's always worried Father's going to fire her, even without something like this.
AchillesGhostAdminProgress01|Achilles Ghost Admin Progress 01|Achilles|I have to say, lad! This place is livelier than usual, of late. Some of the old fixtures of the House getting patched up, new furnishings... it's rather nice, really. We've you to thank, don't we.
AchillesGhostAdminProgress01|Achilles Ghost Admin Progress 01|Zagreus|Oh, that? It's nothing. Though I'm glad it's made a difference for the better. Our contractor's been doing all the work, I'm just putting in the orders.
AchillesGhostAdminProgress01|Achilles Ghost Admin Progress 01|Achilles|And the funds. Your father runs the Underworld a certain way. This old House is lavish, I suppose, but he has long since ceased trying to make it livable, at all. So the changes are appreciated.
AchillesMiscMeeting01|Achilles Misc Meeting 01|Achilles|Keep at it, lad. I've known great men throughout my life, and I can always tell when someone's better than their circumstances. Fight like I'd fight out there.
AchillesMiscMeeting01|Achilles Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|I'll give them hell as you once did, Achilles. Though, doubtless many of the shades who stand against me first arrived in Tartarus because of you.
AchillesMiscMeeting02|Achilles Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|Happen to know whom I should thank for the weapons just outside my chambers, Achilles?
AchillesMiscMeeting02|Achilles Misc Meeting 02|Achilles|I'm sure I wouldn't, lad. Though if I happen to run into them, I'll let them know.
AchillesMiscMeeting03|Achilles Misc Meeting 03|Achilles|Your enemy is not the wretched dead, and not your father, lad. It is the Underworld, itself. It has been fashioned to prevent escape. You must have seen, by now, how all the chambers seem to rearrange themselves.
AchillesMiscMeeting03|Achilles Misc Meeting 03|Zagreus|The Underworld itself, my enemy... I'll do my best anticipating its surprises, sir.
AchillesMiscMeeting04|Achilles Misc Meeting 04|Achilles|The sealed weapons by your chambers; your father won't observe their absence, I don't think. They remind him of a time he stood together with his brothers and sisters. He wants nothing more to do with any of that. I think it's fitting you've inherited their power.
AchillesMiscMeeting04|Achilles Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|A power that once sealed away the Titans... maybe it's a power that can break me out of here. Thank you for helping me, Achilles.
AchillesAboutFistWeapon01|Achilles About Fist Weapon 01|Zagreus|I got acquainted with the Twin Fists of Malphon recently, sir. Fills me with a kind of battle-hunger I'd not felt before. To think the empty hand could have as much destructive force as any weapon.
AchillesAboutFistWeapon01|Achilles About Fist Weapon 01|Achilles|The empty hand has more destructive force than any weapon, lad. It is the only weapon that can wield all others. And without it, all others are nearly powerless. The Twin Fists are a testament to that. Use them with care. Don't lose your head out there.
AchillesAboutGunWeapon01|Achilles About Gun Weapon 01|Zagreus|I found another weapon waiting for me in the courtyard, Achilles. *Exagryph*. I never entirely believed it was real.
AchillesAboutGunWeapon01|Achilles About Gun Weapon 01|Achilles|Between us, lad... I wish it wasn't. Were such a thing available to my enemies during my fighting days, I surely would have come here even sooner. But I trust you have the training to use it well. May it serve you as it served the fire goddess Hestia... she hasn't needed it in a while.
AchillesAboutQuestLog01|Achilles About Quest Log 01|Achilles|I have to say, lad? Authorizing transfer of the Fated List from the old archives, straight into your chambers... bold of you! And right beneath your father's nose, at that.
AchillesAboutQuestLog01|Achilles About Quest Log 01|Zagreus|Oh, that? Just another job from the House Contractor near as I'm concerned, sir. Not like anything on the list was getting done while it was stuck in the archives, besides!
AchillesAboutQuestLog01|Achilles About Quest Log 01|Achilles|Well, that's the spirit, I suppose. If there's one thing I know, it's that the Three Fates always get their way; but if you wish to help them go about it, then perhaps they'll pay you back in kind.
AchillesAboutBoonList01|Achilles About Boon List 01|Achilles|Thought I'd put in a House Contractor order to keep that Codex of yours sorted, lad. Now that you know so many on Olympus, figured it must be a lot keeping track of all their blessings and such.
AchillesAboutBoonList01|Achilles About Boon List 01|Zagreus|Yes, that should definitely come in handy, sir! I'm still getting a handle on everything I can do, with all the Olympians' powers fused with mine.
AchillesAboutSuperLockKeys01|Achilles About Super Lock Keys 01|Zagreus|Achilles, sir? I got a relic of some sort out there... a globule of ancient blood, which formed after I fought with Megaera. Is this really the Titans' blood I found?
AchillesAboutSuperLockKeys01|Achilles About Super Lock Keys 01|Achilles|As far as I know, yes, lad. That it is. Though whose, exactly, I'm not so sure. You'd best hang onto it, and keep it safe. Your weapons... they shall thirst for it and drink it up. Not yet, perhaps, but soon.
AchillesAboutSuperGiftPoints01|Achilles About Super Gift Points 01|Zagreus|Hey, look at what I got out there, Achilles sir! A vintage bottle of Ambrosia, plucked straight from Elysium! I hear this stuff is very good, but... can't even open it. I've no idea what to do with it, right now.
AchillesAboutSuperGiftPoints01|Achilles About Super Gift Points 01|Achilles|The drink of the gods! I hear it's good, all right. But only for recipients with whom you're close. Perhaps hang onto it until it's ripe for use? Somebody would be grateful I am sure. Or it could fetch you something from the Wretched Broker over there.
AchillesAboutOnions01|Achilles About Onions 01|Zagreus|Achilles, sir, I have a very important question... why do you detest onions so much? Have they wronged you, somehow?
AchillesAboutOnions01|Achilles About Onions 01|Achilles|As soon as you slice into one of those things... it makes you cry. Don't you find that a bit unsettling, lad? I won't shed tears over a cut-up vegetable.
AchillesAboutOnions01|Achilles About Onions 01|Zagreus|Well, apparently they're pretty tasty if you don't eat them raw.
AchillesPostFlashback01|Achilles Post Flashback 01|Achilles|Your extended family, the Olympians... they wish to help you from this place, don't they? I just hope that their intentions are as pure as they appear. They don't get on well with your father.
AchillesPostFlashback01|Achilles Post Flashback 01|Zagreus|Neither do I, last time I checked. I'll take all the help I can get trying to break out of here.
AchillesPostFlashback01|Achilles Post Flashback 01|Achilles|I'm pleased to hear you say that. I have known too many far too proud to accept help, even when it was sorely needed. You just be careful, lad.
AchillesFlashback02|Achilles Flashback 02|Achilles|Talk later. Best not keep your father waiting.
AchillesAboutMegaeraRelationship01|Achilles About Megaera Relationship 01|Achilles|Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?
AchillesAboutMegaeraRelationship01|Achilles About Megaera Relationship 01|Zagreus|Well, you know, just... the usual struggles of battling toward the surface, generally to some ignoble death, though... wait, you mean between myself and Megaera, don't you.
AchillesAboutMegaeraRelationship01|Achilles About Megaera Relationship 01|Achilles|I think she likes you more than she lets on. You have a certain way, besides. I know you two got off to a rough start. And circumstances lately haven't helped. But, if you love her... follow your heart.
AchillesAboutMegaeraRelationship01|Achilles About Megaera Relationship 01|Zagreus|And, what if I don't...? I hesitate to even use the word.
AchillesAboutMegaeraRelationship01|Achilles About Megaera Relationship 01|Achilles|If you don't... then cease with giving her such lavish gifts, I ought to think! No need to send the wrong impression, and there is nothing to be gained from such an empty gesture, anyhow.
AchillesAboutThanatosRelationship01|Achilles About Thanatos Relationship 01|Achilles|Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?
AchillesAboutThanatosRelationship01|Achilles About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|Well, you know, just... the usual struggles of battling toward the surface, generally to some ignoble death, though... wait, you mean between myself and Thanatos, don't you.
AchillesAboutThanatosRelationship01|Achilles About Thanatos Relationship 01|Achilles|I think he cares for you more deeply than you know. You have a certain way, besides. It has been difficult between you two. And circumstances lately haven't helped. But, if you love him... follow your heart.
AchillesAboutThanatosRelationship01|Achilles About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|Whoa, just a moment, there, I mean... I've never said something like that, have I?
AchillesAboutThanatosRelationship01|Achilles About Thanatos Relationship 01|Achilles|You haven't, no. And it is not my business to presume too much. Nevertheless, if your friendship with Thanatos is bounded... then, I would suggest you cease with giving him more lavish gifts. No need to send the wrong impression, right?
AchillesAboutMegAndThanRelationship01|Achilles About Meg And Than Relationship 01|Achilles|Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?
AchillesAboutMegAndThanRelationship01|Achilles About Meg And Than Relationship 01|Zagreus|Well, you know, just... the usual struggles of battling toward the surface, generally to some ignoble death, though... wait, you mean between me, Meg, and Thanatos, don't you.
AchillesAboutMegAndThanRelationship01|Achilles About Meg And Than Relationship 01|Achilles|If I may presume a bit, I gather that they share by now the feelings that you have for each of them; each in their respective way, of course. If you love them... one, the other, perhaps both? I mean, you're gods...! Follow your heart.
AchillesAboutMegAndThanRelationship01|Achilles About Meg And Than Relationship 01|Zagreus|*Whoa*, just a moment, there, I mean... ugh, I suppose you're not presuming much at all. Follow my heart, though? Where?
AchillesAboutMegAndThanRelationship01|Achilles About Meg And Than Relationship 01|Achilles|Wherever it should lead; that's how it works. Yours to decide when you've gone as far as you ought, and cease with the lavish gifts. No need to send the wrong impression, and there's nothing to be gained from such an empty gesture, anyhow, right?
AchillesAboutMultipleRelationships01|Achilles About Multiple Relationships 01|Achilles|I think I see that look again, if I am not mistaken in it, lad. What's on your mind? If you would like to share, I'm listening.
AchillesAboutMultipleRelationships01|Achilles About Multiple Relationships 01|Zagreus|*Oh*, it's just... sometimes, I find my thoughts, they wander between those I care about, it's... not just one. You mortals, typically you had a single suitor, did you not...?
AchillesAboutMultipleRelationships01|Achilles About Multiple Relationships 01|Achilles|So we often told each other, yes. But... you're not like us mortals, or us shades. Nor are most of the others here. You gods... I cannot think of even one who had a single mate. Although, your father... maybe he is one.
AchillesAboutMultipleRelationships01|Achilles About Multiple Relationships 01|Zagreus|Wait, you're saying Father, he was never with somebody else besides... my mother?
AchillesAboutMultipleRelationships01|Achilles About Multiple Relationships 01|Achilles|Well, I of course don't know so very much about him, lad. But that's the way of it, from what I've learned. You needn't follow in his footsteps, though; I think you know that well enough by now.
AchillesAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Achilles About Being Close With Megaera 01|Achilles|Meant to tell you. Recently, I noticed Megaera, and... I believe I saw the faintest smile play across her lips. That anything to do with you, perhaps? Not asking for specifics, mind.
AchillesAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Achilles About Being Close With Megaera 01|Zagreus|You really think that has to do with me...? I mean, I hope you're right, and I suppose it's possible, it's just... how can you tell?
AchillesAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Achilles About Being Close With Megaera 01|Achilles|Perhaps with time, I've grown keen to more than just the weaknesses of my enemies on the battlefield. Especially since I don't have those anymore. I'm happy for you, lad. The two of you.
AchillesAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Achilles About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Achilles|I have to tell you something, lad. When Thanatos returned to seek you out, I was very concerned. Not just for you, either. But you've since patched things up...?
AchillesAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Achilles About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Zagreus|I think so. I hope so. It was complicated for a while there, but... I think things are clearer for us, now. Not just in the moment, but in retrospect. *Ugh*, I'm not making any sense.
AchillesAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Achilles About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Achilles|Oh, on the contrary. I think I know exactly what you mean. I don't know Thanatos particularly well. Wasn't he who brought me here, you see. And he was always very busy, like your father. But, he always struck me as a decent sort.
AchillesAboutFurySisters01|Achilles About Fury Sisters 01|Zagreus|Achilles, I ran into Meg's sisters out there. We didn't really hit it off. Meg said they're not permitted in the House. Not that I'm complaining, but... what's that about?
AchillesAboutFurySisters01|Achilles About Fury Sisters 01|Achilles|They have not earned the right, lad. Nor expressed any desire to exist here with the rest of us. Your father has assigned them to specific roles that suit their dispositions. They're... not as sensible as Megaera, in my experience.
AchillesAboutFurySisters01|Achilles About Fury Sisters 01|Zagreus|That's what I was afraid of. Although, fear is for the weak.
AchillesAboutThanatos01|Achilles About Thanatos 01|Achilles|You saw that Thanatos is back, didn't you, lad? He's been over there brooding, when he's around, at least.
AchillesAboutThanatos01|Achilles About Thanatos 01|Zagreus|I saw, Achilles. I think he's angry with me because of my decision to leave the House. Not that it's any of his business.
AchillesAboutThanatos01|Achilles About Thanatos 01|Achilles|Oh, don't say that. It isn't everyday or night when one discovers that his closest friend has had it with his temperamental father, and decided to leave home. I think he's struggling with what to make of it. Be gentle with him, will you?
AchillesAboutZagreus01|Achilles About Zagreus 01|Zagreus|Hey, Achilles, I... uncovered a late passage in the Codex, with regard to Thanatos and me. It says, *you *say, you think that I'm the god of *blood*? I'm not the god of anything, I think...
AchillesAboutZagreus01|Achilles About Zagreus 01|Achilles|Oh, nonsense, lad! If you're a god, then you're the god of *something*, I'm sure. It's just an observation, and I genuinely hope it's no offense. But, see... your father, and your mother, and your bloodstones, and your disposition...
AchillesAboutSkelly01|Achilles About Skelly 01|Zagreus|Achilles, I've been meaning to ask you about the odd skeleton usually standing around in the courtyard. Old acquaintance of yours? A hireling, perhaps?
AchillesAboutSkelly01|Achilles About Skelly 01|Achilles|That one, Skelly, was it? We only met when all this business of escape began. If I have a connection to him, I am unaware. Does he claim to know me? Perhaps I slew him when we were alive.
AchillesAboutSkelly01|Achilles About Skelly 01|Zagreus|I don't know that that's it. So neither of us has any idea where he's from or how he got there, huh. Can you think of any leads? Nyx doesn't seem to know him, either.
AchillesAboutSkelly01|Achilles About Skelly 01|Achilles|Perhaps the gods of Olympus sent him to your aid? Their methods can be odd. And, there are many who support you. Regardless, he does not appear to be your father's spy, if that is your concern.
AchillesAboutSkelly02|Achilles About Skelly 02|Zagreus|Remember that Skelly character out in the courtyard, sir? Turns out he's been working with Charon all this time. Working for him more like! I had so much help in this, from all of you.
AchillesAboutSkelly02|Achilles About Skelly 02|Achilles|Charon! Of course. He has a stake in all that goes on in the Underworld. And he probably thinks highly of you. This Skelly character, though... he must have been somebody if Charon's confided in him.
AchillesAboutSkelly02|Achilles About Skelly 02|Zagreus|He won't tell me. He was either a venerable sea captain, or a petty thief. Maybe both?
AchillesAboutNyx01|Achilles About Nyx 01|Achilles|In my recent audience with Nyx, lad, she let on that you have mentioned Chaos as of late. Is it true you've met her parent, yourself?
AchillesAboutNyx01|Achilles About Nyx 01|Zagreus|I have. Chaos is... not like anyone I've ever met. At first I was a little worried, meeting this vast primordial entity apparently responsible for all creation, but... they seem all right. Chaos and Nyx haven't been talking for a while, though. You don't know what happened there, do you?
AchillesAboutNyx01|Achilles About Nyx 01|Achilles|I know a little bit, I think. Nyx, she and Chaos, they just... slowly drifted apart. No animosity, not anymore, at least. It happens between parents and children. And once such ties are severed, they cannot always be restored. Especially among primordial gods as old as time, I suppose.
AchillesAboutNyx02|Achilles About Nyx 02|Zagreus|Wanted to ask you more about Nyx and Chaos, sir. So they just drifted apart, I mean... why not just keep in touch? I don't understand. How hard is it just to say hello from time to time?
AchillesAboutNyx02|Achilles About Nyx 02|Achilles|It can be harder than you know. For someone like Nyx... she was responsible for no small part of creation, herself. As her relationship with Chaos grew more strained, she gave birth to Strife, Misery, Doom... sons and daughters you don't hear about too much.
AchillesAboutNyx02|Achilles About Nyx 02|Zagreus|What, really? I've never heard Hypnos or Thanatos mention any of them, let alone Nyx. They sound like a handful. Where are they, what happened?
AchillesAboutNyx02|Achilles About Nyx 02|Achilles|I don't know, lad. On the surface, I suppose? My point is, Nyx had her own problems to contend with. Dealing with her brood, governing the Underworld all on her own before your father arrived. Her relationship with Chaos suffered for it.
AchillesAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Achilles About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Achilles|Lad, I heard from Nyx! She said that she was able recently to reestablish contact with Chaos, thanks to you? You're just full of surprises, reforging old bonds between primordial gods like it was nothing.
AchillesAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Achilles About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Oh, just took a bit of tampering with the Sigil in the admin chamber. Whole bunch of Darkness, too. But I could tell that Nyx and Chaos, they... seemed to really miss each other, to the extent they are able to miss anybody.
AchillesAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Achilles About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Achilles|I think they're plenty capable of missing their loved ones, lad. The amount of time that either of us have existed... it's nothing compared to either of them. Imagine, being apart from someone you care about, for that long...
AchillesAboutTheseusExtremeMeasures01|Achilles About Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|Achilles, sir? You happen to know whether Father authorized the transfer of a Macedonian Tau-Lambda chariot to Elysium in recent memory? I ran into the former hero Theseus, all joyriding about in one of those.
AchillesAboutTheseusExtremeMeasures01|Achilles About Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Achilles|I know the chariot you mean. It's not just any Macedonian. It's modified, apparently by Daedalus, himself. No earthly weapons can do what it does. Though, please don't tell me Theseus put on that mask...?
AchillesAboutTheseusExtremeMeasures01|Achilles About Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|What, you mean the golden matching mask? I saw him wearing it, all right. Looked like a proper fool, I thought. What of it, though?
AchillesAboutTheseusExtremeMeasures01|Achilles About Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Achilles|*Hahah*, well! I think that Daedalus would certainly agree. Heard that he fashioned that mask and outfit as a little joke. For someone deeply prideful, and well unaware. It must have suited Theseus quite well, then, yes?
AchillesAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Achilles About Weapon Enchantments 01|Zagreus|Achilles, wanted to ask you more about the weapons I've been using. They can change shape! So, they've molded themselves to suit me, and remember their past wielders, something like that?
AchillesAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Achilles About Weapon Enchantments 01|Achilles|Something like that. They seem alive, don't they? Taking everything in. I think they long predate even your father's time. Some have seen many different owners. Chances are, you shall not be the last.
AchillesRevealsGuanYuAspect01|Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 01|Achilles|As you may know, lad, I've a connection to the weapons that you use, having once wielded one of them myself. Of course not knowing its significance back then, but I digress. Sometimes, it... well, it keeps in touch. And I've a vision from it to impart.
AchillesRevealsGuanYuAspect01|Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 01|Zagreus|What, you mean a vision from Varatha the Eternal Spear? That's... out of the ordinary, and also a bit concerning. So, what did you see?
AchillesRevealsGuanYuAspect01|Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 01|Achilles|Well... I saw a great, bearded warrior. Bigger than me, pitch-black hair. Bearing an aspect of Varatha unlike any with which I'm familiar. Then he was gone. But, what still lingered were these words: *I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix*.
AchillesRevealsGuanYuAspect01|Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 01|Zagreus|*I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix*... I don't understand. What's that supposed to mean?
AchillesRevealsGuanYuAspect01|Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 01|Achilles|There's one more thing. This was not my first such vision. Long ago... I saw one of Varatha's other bearers. It was *you*. Your Infernal Arms... they must be weapons of the Fates' design. They know already who shall brandish them. Now they ask a favor. Seek Varatha. Speak the words. Go.
AchillesRevealsGuanYuAspect02|Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 02|Zagreus|Achilles...! Something awakened in Varatha when I spoke the words. It revealed to me a form I'd never seen. Wielded by the warrior called Guan Yu. Handsomely dressed! And just as you described. That's no Greek name, is it...
AchillesRevealsGuanYuAspect02|Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 02|Achilles|No, I don't think so, lad. I don't know who this Guan Yu is, or where he's from. Or even *when *he's from. But the Fates must have a plan for him, and you. Anyway... I think my part in this is ended. Varatha's served you well, no? I trusted it in life; I trust it now. Fear is for the weak.
AchillesAboutArthurAspect01|Achilles About Arthur Aspect 01|Zagreus|Achilles, sir! I've uncovered the hidden aspect for Stygius! Nyx gave me the words this time, and a vision of a noble leader among mortals. An entire armored legion of them! Arthur was his name. *Will be *his name, I guess.
AchillesAboutArthurAspect01|Achilles About Arthur Aspect 01|Achilles|A future leader among men, wielding that blade? The mysteries of the Infernal Arms run deep, don't they. Although it seems that you and Stygius formed quite a bond.
AchillesAboutRamaAspect01|Achilles About Rama Aspect 01|Zagreus|Achilles, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Heart-Seeker. Lady Artemis herself told me the words, and... it seems Coronacht belonged to, maybe *will *belong to somebody called Rama. Peerless with the bow. Even among gods...
AchillesAboutRamaAspect01|Achilles About Rama Aspect 01|Achilles|Many lay claim to peerlessness with bows in my experience, there, lad, although... I'm not to judge a vision from an ancient weapon such as that. I hope this Rama shall use his weapon wisely when the time comes; same as you.
AchillesAboutBeowulfAspect01|Achilles About Beowulf Aspect 01|Zagreus|Achilles, sir, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Shield of Chaos... thanks to Chaos, themself. Apparently someday it'll protect an armored warrior known as Beowulf from all sorts of dangers... even a dragon! Mortals don't stand much of a chance against those, do they?
AchillesAboutBeowulfAspect01|Achilles About Beowulf Aspect 01|Achilles|Depends upon the dragon, I suppose. I've heard they differ all across the world. Though, that's a fascinating find, there, lad. This Beowulf... sounds like he'll find a way to make good use of all that protective gear. Always preferred mobility, myself, but then, to each his own.
AchillesAboutGilgameshAspect01|Achilles About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|The Bull of Minos led me to another hidden aspect, Achilles! A beastly form of the Twin Fists, belonging to an ancient god-king known as Gilgamesh. You ever hear that name? He had a half-beast friend, apparently. Like how Asterius is friend to Theseus.
AchillesAboutGilgameshAspect01|Achilles About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Achilles|Gilgamesh, you said...? That name isn't familiar to me, but... with these hidden aspects, there's bound to be a connection to the future, or the past. Say, why is the Bull of Minos aiding you? I thought he was one of your rivals barring passage from Elysium.
AchillesAboutGilgameshAspect01|Achilles About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|Oh, he is. He's loyal through and through to Theseus, and never holds back when we fight. But he seems to be the respect-for-his-opponent type. Unlike his companion.
AchillesAboutLuciferAspect01|Achilles About Lucifer Aspect 01|Zagreus|Achilles, I discovered the hidden aspect of the Adamant Rail, after Lord Zeus himself told me the waking-phrase. It's from a winged fellow by the name of Lucifer... apparently had a bit of a falling out with his lord father. Wonder how that worked out for him.
AchillesAboutLuciferAspect01|Achilles About Lucifer Aspect 01|Achilles|*Huh*! Perhaps it's from a time even before the Olympians rebelled against the Titans. But I've never heard of any Lucifer, with or without wings. Suggests to me, perhaps that falling out of his did not work out so well.
AchillesAboutLegendaryAspects01|Achilles About Legendary Aspects 01|Zagreus|Achilles, something I've been wondering... now that I've discovered all the hidden aspects of my weapons... as far as I know, anyway... I can't see any pattern there, at all. Guan Yu, Gilgamesh, Rama, and so on... any idea why them?
AchillesAboutLegendaryAspects01|Achilles About Legendary Aspects 01|Achilles|To know for certain, I suppose you'd have to ask the Fates, themselves... and get an answer from them, too. I ask myself how come you found an aspect of mine, among them all. What made me so special, do you suppose?
AchillesAboutLegendaryAspects01|Achilles About Legendary Aspects 01|Zagreus|You were a great warrior! Famous, in your time! It's no surprise to me at all the Fates chose you to have a stint with one of their world-altering weapons.
AchillesAboutLegendaryAspects01|Achilles About Legendary Aspects 01|Achilles|Well, that's just it! I was quite famous, yes. Infamous, perhaps, but no matter. Perhaps it's just that these weapons demand to make themselves known, above all. To leave a lasting impression in the hands of their wielders.
AchillesAboutLegendaryAspects01|Achilles About Legendary Aspects 01|Zagreus|You think the Infernal Arms just want to be *popular*? Have exciting stories told about them and whatnot?
AchillesAboutAchillesAspect01|Achilles About Achilles Aspect 01|Zagreus|I've had the opportunity to use your aspect of Varatha, sir. So, you once wielded it yourself? It... fills me with a hunger for battle even more so than usual. A bit of your fighting spirit, perhaps.
AchillesAboutAchillesAspect01|Achilles About Achilles Aspect 01|Achilles|Be very wary of that spirit, lad. It was what brought me here before my time. Although that spear indeed once served me well. A parting gift from my old master Chiron. He cautioned me as I am cautioning you. Though, may you be a better listener.
AchillesAboutChironAspect01|Achilles About Chiron Aspect 01|Zagreus|Achilles, I meant to ask, did you know that Coronacht the Heart-Seeker once belonged to the centaur, Chiron? Because one of its aspects is his own. He didn't have it back when you trained with him, did he...?
AchillesAboutChironAspect01|Achilles About Chiron Aspect 01|Achilles|Master Chiron, truly...? Ah, of course. He granted me a spear, I think you know. If he possessed one such weapon, why not more? I remember his bow shined like the sun. It was splendid, and never missed its mark... though I attributed that to Chiron's extraordinary skill.
AchillesAboutMirror01|Achilles About Mirror 01|Achilles|I have to thank you for the mirror back there, lad. Lets me get a better look at things out in the great hall every now and then.
AchillesAboutMirror01|Achilles About Mirror 01|Zagreus|Of course, sir, don't mention it. You're really stuck having to guard this corridor most of the time, huh?
AchillesAboutMirror01|Achilles About Mirror 01|Achilles|Oh certainly, it's an important corridor! Think of it, if just any shade could pass through either of those doors back there. Your father's barely keeping it together, as it is.
AchillesAboutWarriorStatue01|Achilles About Warrior Statue 01|Achilles|Quite a statue you commissioned over there. I suppose I can think of worse subjects than mighty Heracles for me to have to stand about and stare at.
AchillesAboutWarriorStatue01|Achilles About Warrior Statue 01|Zagreus|They say he was the strongest demigod who ever lived. Though, I bet you could take him, sir. Big guy like that, you'd be too quick, I'm sure. You ever meet him?
AchillesAboutWarriorStatue01|Achilles About Warrior Statue 01|Achilles|Only in passing. He once died a mortal's death... worse than mine. Had a brief stint down here, but... he's favored by Olympus. Got a special arrangement of some sort, I heard. Haven't seen him since.
AchillesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Achilles About Office Backstory 01|Zagreus|Achilles, looks like I could buy back my right to go in the administrative chamber, there. I never want to go in there again, but... can you think of any reason whatsoever that I should?
AchillesAboutOfficeBackstory01|Achilles About Office Backstory 01|Achilles|*Hah*, well. Perhaps we all want what we cannot have. Other than that, I suppose certain documents or records in there could be of some benefit under the circumstances, right?
AchillesAboutLegendary01|Achilles About Legendary 01|Zagreus|That Chthonic Companion you gave me, sir... have to say it's been amazing to see you and Patroclus in action. I thought you said your fighting days were over?
AchillesAboutLegendary01|Achilles About Legendary 01|Achilles|Yes, well... that was before I was reunited with Patroclus, and had the opportunity to help you in a pinch, with him at my side. I trust we were of some small service, then?
AchillesVsHades01|Achilles Vs Hades 01|Zagreus|Achilles, I... sometimes I fear that Father, if he learns that you've been aiding me, that he will... not be generous with you.
AchillesVsHades01|Achilles Vs Hades 01|Achilles|Don't worry about me, lad. Your father's still getting caught up with work that I created for him in my mortal days. Besides... there's nothing he can take from me. We have a mutual arrangement, he and I.
AchillesVsHades02|Achilles Vs Hades 02|Zagreus|Achilles, I'm concerned that Father's growing angrier with you. He thinks you've taken sides against him in all this. I don't want anything to happen.
AchillesVsHades02|Achilles Vs Hades 02|Achilles|He's right, lad. I have taken sides. But, as for you not wanting anything to happen... while I know what you meant, I don't want you to say such things again. Do you understand? You're doing this because something here *needs *to happen. Hold back your fear.
AchillesVsAphrodite01|Achilles Vs Aphrodite 01|Zagreus|Wanted to say, the Lady Aphrodite asked that I relay a message to you, sir. She said that she admires you. Mentioned a certain war.
AchillesVsAphrodite01|Achilles Vs Aphrodite 01|Achilles|Admires me, does she? Sometimes, lad, I think that Aphrodite is the mightiest of all the gods. Her power is what spurs us all to action. Whether to love, or war. Or sometimes both the two. I'm grateful for the message.
AchillesVsArtemis01|Achilles Vs Artemis 01|Zagreus|Hey, Achilles! I heard from Lady Artemis out there. It seems you have a bit of a fan in her. She wanted me to tell you you're the best! She's not mistaken, by the way.
AchillesVsArtemis01|Achilles Vs Artemis 01|Achilles|The goddess of the hunt herself said that? That's very flattering to hear. Good thing she doesn't know I'm all washed up, by now. Her memory is of my glory days.
AchillesAboutDaedalus01|Achilles About Daedalus 01|Zagreus|Achilles, have you ever run across the shade of Daedalus in all your time? I've found some of his legendary hammers out there, but no sign of him.
AchillesAboutDaedalus01|Achilles About Daedalus 01|Achilles|I've never met him, no. Your father keeps him fully occupied with building out his Underworld, and renovating constantly. No wonder some of his old crafting-tools are strewn about. I take it you've been able to make use of them?
AchillesAboutGiftingGods01|Achilles About Gifting Gods 01|Zagreus|Achilles, did you ever use to pray to the gods? Make offerings to them and such, back when you were alive?
AchillesAboutGiftingGods01|Achilles About Gifting Gods 01|Achilles|Prayed mostly to my mother, lad. I always had my doubts the gods were listening. That they could even hear. Though, I suppose that if you make an offering, they might be so inclined, just for the moment, anyway. They helping much?
AchillesAboutDemeter01|Achilles About Demeter 01|Achilles|You have a worried look about you, lad. Spare me your thoughts?
AchillesAboutDemeter01|Achilles About Demeter 01|Zagreus|Oh, it's just... I met the goddess Demeter out there. The blessings that she offered, they... just drained the heat and life from everything. I thought she saw to fruits and grains and vegetables and such? Not that I'm complaining.
AchillesAboutDemeter01|Achilles About Demeter 01|Achilles|All gods and goddesses are to be feared. Demeter, she has the power to give life, or take it. Seems she's more interested in the latter, though. She's the eldest on Olympus, and your father seems to harbor a particular dislike for her. I don't know why. Be careful.
AchillesAboutDusaFiring01_A|Achilles About Dusa Firing 01 A|Zagreus|Achilles, what happened between Nyx and Dusa? Dusa's really gone?
AchillesAboutDusaFiring01_A|Achilles About Dusa Firing 01 A|Achilles|Nyx cut her off, lad. I'm sorry. I know you cared about her. I was as surprised as you when I found out. I knew that Nyx had her concerns about Dusa's propensity to overwork herself, but... this wasn't the step I was expecting.
AchillesAboutDusaFiring01_A|Achilles About Dusa Firing 01 A|Zagreus|Propensity to overwork herself... you really think that's what this was about? I can't shake the feeling it's my fault. Nyx didn't want her talking to me, as though she's beneath me or something! *Ugh*, what am I going to do.
AchillesAboutDusaFiring01_A|Achilles About Dusa Firing 01 A|Achilles|Look... I don't have all the information on this one, and neither do you from the sound of things. Nyx loves you and respects you. I trust she would want to know how this affects you.
AchillesAboutDusaReHiring01|Achilles About Dusa Re Hiring 01|Zagreus|Did you see, sir? Dusa's returned! Nyx must have reconsidered her decision.
AchillesAboutDusaReHiring01|Achilles About Dusa Re Hiring 01|Achilles|She must have, indeed, lad. I was pleased to see Dusa return. And you know what...? I daresay she seemed rather well-rested, for a change. It might not have been the best of circumstances, though my hope is that some good has come of it.
AchillesRunProgress01|Achilles Run Progress 01|Achilles|I understand you've made it all the way to Asphodel of late, haven't you, lad?
AchillesRunProgress01|Achilles Run Progress 01|Zagreus|I guess word travels faster than I do. Why do you ask, Achilles?
AchillesRunProgress01|Achilles Run Progress 01|Achilles|...No reason in particular. Just that it brings me joy to hear of your progress.
AchillesRunProgress02|Achilles Run Progress 02|Achilles|I haven't seen you in a while, lad. You made it to Elysium last time, didn't you.
AchillesRunProgress02|Achilles Run Progress 02|Zagreus|I did, Achilles. It's crawling with great warriors still looking for a fight. It's not exactly what I was expecting.
AchillesRunProgress02|Achilles Run Progress 02|Achilles|Your father's marshalled the most willing ones to deal with you. Doubtless there's much at stake in it for them, if but the pride of having done the task. Although I think that pride will always be their weakness.
AchillesRunProgress03|Achilles Run Progress 03|Achilles|I couldn't help but notice, lad, that Cerberus has been away for quite some time. Turns out your father's put him back to work above. I truly hope you shall not have to come to blows.
AchillesRunProgress03|Achilles Run Progress 03|Zagreus|Don't worry, sir. I've run into Cerberus up top, all right. Even if he's technically Father's pet, he'd never bare his fangs at me. No matter how much Father might wish otherwise.
AchillesAboutStyxFoes01|Achilles About Styx Foes 01|Achilles|I don't wish to presume, lad, but you seem more glum than usual. What's weighing on you, there, if you don't mind?
AchillesAboutStyxFoes01|Achilles About Styx Foes 01|Zagreus|Oh, it's just... I've never slain a living creature, sir. Until my recent journey to the Temple up above. I know they're just Satyrs and vermin, but... it's not the same as sending wretches to the depths.
AchillesAboutStyxFoes01|Achilles About Styx Foes 01|Achilles|Look. All mortal life is fragile; it simply is a struggle to survive. Sooner or later it fails to succeed, and then, it ends up here. And we have room enough for everyone, even the Satyrs and the vermin of the world.
AchillesAboutStyxFoes01|Achilles About Styx Foes 01|Zagreus|Now that you mention it, I have to say I'm glad we can accommodate all former-living things. And at least mortals get to rest assured knowing what happens once they die! Must really ease the mind.
AchillesRunNotCleared01|Achilles Run Not Cleared 01|Achilles|I saw your father storm out of the House in his regalia. So he must have confronted you himself, at last. I... see that must have not gone well. You were so close.
AchillesRunNotCleared01|Achilles Run Not Cleared 01|Zagreus|Well, at least I know who will be waiting for me the next time I climb all the way to the Temple of Styx and manage my way out.
AchillesRunNotCleared01|Achilles Run Not Cleared 01|Achilles|Don't lose heart, lad. I did not train your father, only you. He is a god; but he is just a god. If you'll forgive my bit of treason there.
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|I found her, sir! My mother, she's... alive and well, and... *ugh*, but I just couldn't stay up there, for very long. I have to get back to her!
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 01|Achilles|You really made it all the way? You must have... gotten past your father, that's amazing, lad. But, wait, what was she like, what happened to you there?
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|She was... she was great! Nothing like Father, more like... *you*, a little bit, I guess! Though, being on the surface, it just seemed to suck the life right out of me. Even without the wretches of the Underworld trying to do me in.
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 01|Achilles|But then, you had a little time at least! Sounds like you have unfinished business with her, there. You got to her this once... surely you're able to again, isn't that right?
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 02|Achilles|How did it go, lad? You've been gone a while. For good reason, I hope?
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|I found her, again, sir, and... we were able to talk some more. But, I have so many questions left for her, and Father's certainly not been of any help...
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 02|Achilles|Well, first of all, good work. I knew you had it in you. Secondly... you know what you have to do. Go find her, for as many chances as it takes. It's not just her you've sought... it's the answers to those questions that you have.
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 03|Achilles|So, you can tell me in due time if you decide to, lad. But I do have a question, same as you did, going into this. Why did she leave? Why did she leave *you*, in particular?
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|It's that she didn't even know I was alive. Sounds as though Nyx revived me sometime after I was born, but by that point... Mother had already left, and... they let her be. For reasons I am trying to find out.
AchillesAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Achilles About Persephone Meeting 03|Achilles|Ah, that's... quite a bit to take in, there. And it explains more than a bit, I think. Look, I'm not one to speculate too much. I trust you'll find the answers that you seek as you proceed.
AchillesRunNotCleared02|Achilles Run Not Cleared 02|Achilles|What news this time, lad? Did you find your mother, once again?
AchillesRunNotCleared02|Achilles Run Not Cleared 02|Zagreus|No, I failed, sir. No thanks to Father! *Urgh*, what am I going to do?
AchillesRunNotCleared02|Achilles Run Not Cleared 02|Achilles|Just take it easy, now. You got there once, there isn't any question in my mind that you can do it once again. Your father's acting as though nothing's changed, besides. So, don't lose hope. You're capable of this.
AchillesRunCleared01|Achilles Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|Hey, tell me something, sir. Any rumors swirling about the House regarding the outcome of a certain interaction I had with my father recently? Involving a great deal of violence? Because I'd like for everyone to know: I won.
AchillesRunCleared01|Achilles Run Cleared 01|Achilles|I wouldn't know of what you mean, there, lad. For there are certain subjects so forbidden here right now that not even rumors can take hold. But, just between us for the time: Congratulations. Truly.
AchillesRunCleared01|Achilles Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|Thank you, sir. I didn't know whether I had it in me. As for the other bit, I'll keep it quiet, then, for now. I probably shouldn't be tying my sense of self-worth to praise from friends, acquaintances, and strangers, anyway.
AchillesPostEnding01|Achilles Post Ending 01|Achilles|The Queen is back! You did it, lad. You must have lots of catching up to do. Or patching up. And, I'm to understand that your escape attempts, they are officially approved, isn't that so?
AchillesPostEnding01|Achilles Post Ending 01|Zagreus|That's so, indeed, sir. Especially for now, at least, I'm going to keep on fighting to the surface. Helps me to vent a bit, and, like Hypnos says, it makes the Underworld a better place! Though indirectly, I suppose.
AchillesPostEnding01|Achilles Post Ending 01|Achilles|Well, then, I look forward to working with you in a more formal capacity. And, it is my sincerest hope that you, your mother, and your father learn to get on better with each other, now.
AchillesPostEnding02|Achilles Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Hey sir, meant to say I hope I didn't get you into too much trouble after letting me in Father's bedchambers.
AchillesPostEnding02|Achilles Post Ending 02|Achilles|Think nothing of it, lad. It was a risk I was willing to take, and for his part, your father looked the other way on that one. Though I did not expect you'd get free rein to go there as you please.
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Achilles|So, lad, tell me, then. How went the family feast, was everything all right?
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Well, I confess I was perhaps a little nervous for practically the entire thing, but... all in all, I had a good time, and I'm very, very glad it all turned out the way it did. How about yourself?
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Achilles|I quite enjoyed it, too. Last time I was invited to a feast, I was still busy warring on the surface, that's how long it's been. I must say, your mother is quite good with words! Had everybody chatting, laughing...
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|She really pulled it off! But... for all her confidence, I don't think she knew she had it in her. Because if she did... if she reached out to Olympus sooner... a lot of things could have been different.
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Achilles|Don't dwell on that. I spoke a bit with Nyx. Your mother had her reasons. No one gets to act on perfect information, right? All we have is what we think we know, and what our conscience tells us. Your mother got to where all this was possible... all thanks to you.
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|All thanks to me, sir? I had ample help along the way. For instance, I could not have done it without *you*. Would have been using an old chair leg as a weapon, I suppose.
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Achilles|And what a fearsome chair leg it would be! In any case... you heading out there, soon? Olympus should be more than happy to assist in your security review. If that's what we're calling it now.
AchillesPostEpilogue01|Achilles Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Yeah, I should go. I'll see you not too long from now.
AchillesPostEpilogue02|Achilles Post Epilogue 02|Achilles|I'm so impressed with what you've managed to accomplish, lad. When I was closer to your age... or, the age you appear to be... all I wanted was glory. To be remembered forever. Look where that got me! I'm glad you know better than I did.
AchillesPostEpilogue02|Achilles Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|So in pursuing glory... you think you lost it? Forgive me, here, but I just disagree. I settled a family squabble. You single-handedly turned an entire war!
AchillesPostEpilogue02|Achilles Post Epilogue 02|Achilles|A foolish war. Glory comes to those driven to excel in worthwhile pursuits. A happy side effect, not a goal unto itself. Though, you don't need for me to tell you that.
AchillesPostEpilogue02|Achilles Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|If not for all your training and advice, I wouldn't have come this far. You prepared me for this. Wasn't that a worthwhile pursuit? Must mean you got some glory after all, then, right?
AchillesCodexProgress01|Achilles Codex Progress 01|Achilles|You're getting somewhere with that Codex, lad. I'm pleased to see it. My duties to the House have meant that, lately, I can't travel quite as much as once I did.
AchillesCodexProgress01|Achilles Codex Progress 01|Zagreus|I'll try to travel for the both of us, Achilles. I've seen so little other than these walls.
AchillesCodexProgress02|Achilles Codex Progress 02|Achilles|Well, look at you, lad, with that Codex brimming with our history! I knew I could rely on you to fill it out. Back when I was alive, why, no one would have ever believed what goes on down here.
AchillesCodexProgress02|Achilles Codex Progress 02|Zagreus|Mortals must have had their stories, though. About what happens to them once they die, and once they end up in this place.
AchillesCodexProgress02|Achilles Codex Progress 02|Achilles|They have their stories, definitely so. They fear your father, understandably. They also fear your dog. But most of them know precious little else. Even their fears, I think, are born of ignorance. As most fears tend to be.
AchillesCodexProgress03|Achilles Codex Progress 03|Zagreus|Achilles, sir... within the Codex, you'd written something, about someone with whom you shared your life... when you were flesh and blood?
AchillesCodexProgress03|Achilles Codex Progress 03|Achilles|...*Ah*. That is a private matter for me, lad. From a time I had convinced myself the Codex would be for my own eyes, alone. My past is not really worth mentioning. And, I am presently on duty, so... begging your pardon, please.
AchillesCodexProgress05|Achilles Codex Progress 05|Zagreus|*Erm*, Achilles sir, there's something I've been wondering, about your Codex. The words are yours, and yet it's through my actions that I'm able to absorb them. Is that how mortal scriptures always work?
AchillesCodexProgress05|Achilles Codex Progress 05|Achilles|*Ah*. You have to understand, lad, I've been here in your father's realm for quite some time. My documented learnings became bound to me, much like this spear, you see? You can undo those bindings over time. Thus my knowledge can be yours. Whatever it amounts to.
AchillesCodexProgress06|Achilles Codex Progress 06|Achilles|I had the strangest feeling, lad, you mind if... can I see that Codex, there?
AchillesCodexProgress06|Achilles Codex Progress 06|Zagreus|Of course, sir! I've been keeping busy with it, you could say. It's almost complete!
AchillesCodexProgress06|Achilles Codex Progress 06|Achilles|It *is *complete! That's amazing... a chronicle of this place... everything I've ever learned and felt.
AchillesCodexProgress06|Achilles Codex Progress 06|Zagreus|Still always more to learn and feel, though, isn't there?
AchillesMysteryDoor01|Achilles Mystery Door 01|Zagreus|Hey, Achilles? My father's hall back there. I don't suppose you'll let me have myself a look? Lots for me to rummage through, I'm sure.
AchillesMysteryDoor01|Achilles Mystery Door 01|Achilles|You know I'd do just about anything to aid you, lad. But my ability to do so hinges on me sticking to my post. Though if I do catch wind of anything back there requiring attention, you shall know.
AchillesDrinking01|Achilles Drinking 01|Achilles|I'd ask you join me for a drink, lad, but I know you've a task ahead of you, and liquor dulls the senses. Fortunately so, under most circumstances except yours. Leave me to it, will you, and I'll have one for the both of us.
AchillesDrinking01|Achilles Drinking 01|Zagreus|Some other time, Achilles. Just checking in on you, but I'll be on my way again shortly.
AchillesBackstory01|Achilles Backstory 01|Zagreus|Achilles, would you... tell me something more of Patroclus? You mentioned you were very close.
AchillesBackstory01|Achilles Backstory 01|Achilles|We could have been no closer. The ashes of our bodies yet mingle together somewhere on the surface there. What can I tell you, lad? I loved him with all my heart. And he left me too soon.
AchillesBackstory01|Achilles Backstory 01|Zagreus|Then, surely he must be in the Underworld, somewhere... have you not tried to seek him out? Or asked my father?
AchillesBackstory01|Achilles Backstory 01|Achilles|*Hah, haha. *I tried, lad, I have tried. On both accounts. What you propose is not that simple, it turns out. You've seen what it is like out there... it's difficult to find one's way. But I shall tell you what. If you see Patroclus among the countless shades, you tell him I said hi.
AchillesBackstory01B|Achilles Backstory 01 B|Zagreus|Achilles, would you... tell me something more of Patroclus? You mentioned you were very close.
AchillesBackstory01B|Achilles Backstory 01 B|Achilles|We could have been no closer. The ashes of our bodies yet mingle together somewhere on the surface there. What can I tell you, lad? I loved him with all my heart. And he left me too soon.
AchillesBackstory01B|Achilles Backstory 01 B|Zagreus|But now you're both here, in the Underworld! Can't you go seek him out? Or alter your arrangement with my father?
AchillesBackstory01B|Achilles Backstory 01 B|Achilles|*Ha, hah. *I tried, lad, I have tried. On both accounts. What you propose is not that simple, it turns out. But I shall tell you what. When next you see Patroclus on your journeys, you keep speaking to him for me, won't you?
AchillesAboutPatroclus01A|Achilles About Patroclus 01 A|Achilles|How fare your labors, lad? You have a certain look about you. Everything all right?
AchillesAboutPatroclus01A|Achilles About Patroclus 01 A|Zagreus|It's just... within Elysium, I happened on a shade, who said he knew you. Said he misses you. Do you know a Patroclus, sir?
AchillesAboutPatroclus01A|Achilles About Patroclus 01 A|Achilles|What... I... yes. I knew Patroclus, did he... is he all right?
AchillesAboutPatroclus01A|Achilles About Patroclus 01 A|Zagreus|He... I don't know. He seems like he's known better times than these. Is... there something I should say to him, if I run into him again?
AchillesAboutPatroclus01A|Achilles About Patroclus 01 A|Achilles|...Please send him my regards. And... all my love. I think of him always. But I cannot see him any longer. And you mustn't ask me why, do you understand? Now, leave me be, please, lad. I need some time.
AchillesAboutPatroclus01B|Achilles About Patroclus 01 B|Achilles|How fare your labors, lad? You have a certain look about you. Everything all right?
AchillesAboutPatroclus01B|Achilles About Patroclus 01 B|Zagreus|It's just... within Elysium, I happened on a shade. It's your Patroclus. He's all right, but he seems like he's known better times than these. Is there something I should say to him, if I run into him again?
AchillesAboutPatroclus01B|Achilles About Patroclus 01 B|Achilles|Oh...! Well, then, please send him my regards. And... all my love. I think of him always. But I cannot see him any longer. And you mustn't ask me why, do you understand? Now, leave me be, please, lad. I need some time.
AchillesAboutPatroclus02|Achilles About Patroclus 02|Achilles|Hey, listen a moment, lad. I require your discretion with regards to whom we spoke about last time. The shade you met within Elysium.
AchillesAboutPatroclus02|Achilles About Patroclus 02|Zagreus|I understand. What can I do about this, sir? There must be something. But, you have to let me know what's going on.
AchillesAboutPatroclus02|Achilles About Patroclus 02|Achilles|Simply put, he is the reason that I'm here. Patroclus lost his life before I did. Because of me. I shortly followed, in a rage. When I arrived here, I received a hero's welcome. Your father himself ushered me to Elysium. But that's not what I wanted.
AchillesAboutPatroclus02|Achilles About Patroclus 02|Zagreus|You wanted to see Patroclus. But, he's in Elysium, while you... oh, no.
AchillesAboutPatroclus02|Achilles About Patroclus 02|Achilles|I signed a pact, lad. Felt that the terms were good enough. He could live there, while I'd live here, at least for now. Such deals are most uncommon, and their confidentiality must be upheld. But, let's speak no more of this for now, all right? Some other time.
AchillesAboutPatroclus03|Achilles About Patroclus 03|Zagreus|You have to tell me more about this pact you signed, Achilles. You and Patroclus... so, you're doomed to never be together, then?
AchillesAboutPatroclus03|Achilles About Patroclus 03|Achilles|You must safeguard the details of it, lad. Although it's not as bad as you make out. I ensured Patroclus is provided for. We wouldn't have been together anyway. Initially he wasn't sent into Elysium, you see.
AchillesAboutPatroclus03|Achilles About Patroclus 03|Zagreus|There has to be a way for me to make this right. Not just for him, for you.
AchillesAboutPatroclus03|Achilles About Patroclus 03|Achilles|You've other, pressing matters to attend to, lad. And Patroclus and I have ample time to wait this out. I know you mean well, but... do not discuss this matter with your father, now. I fear that it could make things worse. Do you understand?
AchillesAboutPatroclus04|Achilles About Patroclus 04|Zagreus|The... fallen warrior in Elysium we spoke of. He seems like a good man, though... was he always the despondent sort?
AchillesAboutPatroclus04|Achilles About Patroclus 04|Achilles|No, lad. I was that sort, I think, but he was not. He was... one of the only men I knew who did not look upon me as a threat. He saw something in me I never knew was there. And in turn, with him, I felt... how to describe it? Calm. Whole.
AchillesAboutPatroclus04|Achilles About Patroclus 04|Zagreus|*Hah*! I'm restless all the time. I can only imagine.
AchillesAboutPatroclus04|Achilles About Patroclus 04|Achilles|He had this wry humor about him. Like he was wise beyond his years. A quality I trust shall see him through his struggles now. Although... I hoped residing in Elysium would mean he wouldn't have to struggle any longer.
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Zagreus|I know that it's a painful subject, sir, but can you tell me... what exactly happened, in the war that claimed Patroclus and yourself? He brought it up. Said you refused to fight.
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Achilles|Until he died. I did refuse to fight, until he died, but at that point... *ungh*, look, lad, if we're going to discuss these matters, best we do so in the lounge, not here.
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Achilles|...The fool of a king I served... I'd never take up arms, for him. But, Patroclus, he always had a different way of looking at things. As I refused to fight, he rose to the occasion. Took up my armor, led my brothers into battle, in my guise. Fought nobly... but then, he... well.
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Zagreus|And after you found out... you sought vengeance for him. Took vengeance.
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Achilles|That I did. They got me, finally, of course. But, not before I broke them, first. The war soon ended, after that. It is an awful contradiction, that to quickly end war, one need only extinguish many lives at once. I had not realized it at the time.
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Zagreus|Did you... allow yourself to die? So that you could see Patroclus again, here?
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Achilles|...I don't know. Maybe. I only know that I was filled with rage. Rage that subsided, soon after I arrived here. I felt... empty. I never saw Patroclus again. But, I learned my brothers honored my last request, as my ashes were laid to rest with his. *<Sigh> *Anyway...! Appreciate the drink.
AchillesAboutPatroclusBackstory01|Achilles About Patroclus Backstory 01|Achilles|Suppose I'd best be getting back to standing quietly about. Though, that war, lad? Don't ask me about it again. All right?
AchillesAboutPatroclus05|Achilles About Patroclus 05|Achilles|How is he, anyway, if you've encountered him of late during your journeys, lad? The fallen warrior you've run into in Elysium, that is.
AchillesAboutPatroclus05|Achilles About Patroclus 05|Zagreus|He's doing relatively well, I think. There's a lot you've told me... that he didn't know. About what led up to his present circumstances, and your own.
AchillesAboutPatroclus05|Achilles About Patroclus 05|Achilles|You told him, then. Without requesting my consent to tell him, first! What, exactly, did you say to him?
AchillesAboutPatroclus05|Achilles About Patroclus 05|Zagreus|Achilles, I... I'm sorry, I... just told him about your ashes being intermingled, that whole thing? And about the pact. You told me once to send him your love and regards! This brought him no joy, only questions! You told me not to speak to Father, not to him!
AchillesAboutPatroclus05|Achilles About Patroclus 05|Achilles|*<Sigh>*...You're right, I... should have specified. Or shouldn't have. Because what you said, probably is for the best. I didn't mean to lose my temper with you, lad, it's just... look, thank you for looking out for him. For both of us. Just, please be careful.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|I have a message for you from the fallen warrior over in Elysium, Achilles sir. He says... he simply said to let you know to risk it all.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Achilles|To risk it all. He said to risk it all?
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Yes. Is... there something significant about that phrase?
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Achilles|When last he said to risk it all, to me... I didn't listen to him, then. But should have. I should have.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|He's asking you to take another chance.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Achilles|No... he's giving me another chance, I think. I... leave me lad, for now. Thank you for telling me.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|About risking it all, sir. Did you come to any decision about what that meant? What you should do?
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Achilles|I'm getting there, lad. In battle, I would operate on instincts, make snap judgments almost instantly. In other matters, though... I need some time. Your patience, please. I'll let you know if I can figure something out.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_A|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 A|Achilles|I need your help with something, lad. As I'm about to risk it all, I think. Will you hear me out?
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_A|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 A|Zagreus|Of course, sir, what is it? I'm listening.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_A|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 A|Achilles|The pact I signed with your father. It must be buried somewhere down in the administrative chamber there. I dared not ask that you locate it, out of fear that tampering with it would only make things worse, except...
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_A|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 A|Zagreus|...Except that fear is for the weak, Achilles, sir.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_A|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 A|Achilles|Indeed. Besides... your father has been more abiding than I expected with how you were able to nullify the Knave-King's Sentence... so, perhaps my case isn't a lost cause, yet.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_A|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 A|Zagreus|I'll speak with Nyx about it the next chance I get. And I'll be careful, sir. I promise you.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 B|Achilles|I need your help with something, lad. As I'm about to risk it all, I think. Will you hear me out?
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 B|Zagreus|Of course, sir, what is it? I'm listening.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 B|Achilles|The pact I signed with your father. It must be buried somewhere down in the administrative chamber there. I dared not ask that you locate it, out of fear that tampering with it would only make things worse, except...
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 B|Zagreus|...Except that fear is for the weak, Achilles, sir.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 B|Achilles|Indeed. Besides... your father has been more abiding than I expected with how you were able to void the pact that separated Orpheus and Eurydice... so, perhaps my case isn't a lost cause, yet.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 B|Zagreus|I'll speak with Nyx about it the next chance I get. And I'll be careful, sir. I promise you.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_C|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 C|Achilles|I need your help with something, lad. As I'm about to risk it all, I think. Will you hear me out?
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_C|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 C|Zagreus|Of course, sir, what is it? I'm listening.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_C|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 C|Achilles|The pact I signed with your father. It must be buried somewhere down in the administrative chamber there. I dared not ask that you locate it, out of fear that tampering with it would only make things worse, except...
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_C|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 C|Zagreus|...Except that fear is for the weak, Achilles, sir.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_C|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 C|Achilles|Indeed. Besides... your father has been more abiding than I expected with how you were able to nullify the terms for Orpheus and Sisyphus alike, so... perhaps my case isn't a lost cause, yet.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest03_C|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 03 C|Zagreus|I'll speak with Nyx about it the next chance I get. And I'll be careful, sir. I promise you.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest04|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 04|Zagreus|I'm working on trying to find your pact, Achilles. Just need a little more time to sort it out.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest04|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 04|Achilles|I've nothing if not patience, lad. And I shall try to keep my hopes in check. Thank you for your effort around this. When next we speak of it, may it be when you've succeeded.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest04_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 04 B|Zagreus|I'm working on your pact, Achilles. Just need a little more time to sort it out.
AchillesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest04_B|Achilles About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 04 B|Achilles|I've nothing if not patience, lad. And I shall try to keep my hopes in check. Thank you for your effort around this. When next we speak of it, may it be when you've succeeded.
MyrmidonReunionQuestComplete|Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|Achilles! Your pact with Father is officially amended, sir. Specifically, it no longer has any stipulation barring you from entering Elysium during the indefinite term of your employment. On my authority in the name of Hades, thank you for your service.
MyrmidonReunionQuestComplete|Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete|Achilles|What, are you... you're serious. I'm able to go. You're right, I feel it. I'm unbound. So I can... simply leave... right now.
MyrmidonReunionQuestComplete|Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|You can simply leave, right now. And, might I add... it's about damn time.
MyrmidonReunionQuestComplete|Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete|Achilles|I... should get going then, although... I am unprepared, I... didn't think it would come to this. Not that I had no faith in you, it's just...
MyrmidonReunionQuestComplete|Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|Incidentally, there's this one glade out in Elysium I highly recommend... go to him, sir. You've waited long enough. Fear is for the weak.
MyrmidonReunionQuestComplete|Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete|Achilles|...Fear is for the weak. Farewell for now, lad. I can't thank you enough.
AchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|Sir, you're back! How was it in Elysium, was everything all right?
AchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Achilles|It went well, lad. As well as I could have hoped. Better than I might have feared. Hey, don't take Patroclus calling you 'stranger' personally, all right? He has less charitable terms for those he doesn't care for.
AchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|Come on, Achilles, I want details, here! What happened with you two? If you don't mind.
AchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Achilles|*Hahah*, well. Thankfully, your efforts meant that no words really needed to be said, when I arrived. He simply said my name. Then, we just... were. Two souls together in one spot. The way shades linger, it looks mournful, right? But it isn't always.
AchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|That's wonderful to hear. He seemed uplifted in your presence. You must have lots of catching up to do.
AchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Achilles|Lots of making up for lost time. And finally we have some time to spare. It's odd, because so many of my memories of him are from a time of war. Now, we can make new memories in peace. Anyway... see you out there again sometime, I hope?
AchillesAboutHadesBedroom01|Achilles About Hades Bedroom 01|Achilles|What is it, lad, what's wrong? What can I do?
AchillesAboutHadesBedroom01|Achilles About Hades Bedroom 01|Zagreus|Let me in Father's chambers. Please.
AchillesAboutHadesBedroom01|Achilles About Hades Bedroom 01|Achilles|...That's high atop the list of things I'm not to do, for anyone, and under any circumstances. What is it you need? I've never even been in there, myself...
AchillesAboutHadesBedroom01|Achilles About Hades Bedroom 01|Zagreus|I don't know, I don't know! But, if I know Father, and I think I do, he's got to have something of hers in there. Of Mother's! She still doesn't get it, doesn't believe me about him, and... I said I'd prove it. That he cares for her!
AchillesAboutHadesBedroom01|Achilles About Hades Bedroom 01|Achilles|All right, slow down, I understand. Look... this can get me in a lot of trouble, like you've no idea. And, not just me, so... be careful, and be quick, while he's still out. Take this and go. Don't leave anything there out of place, all right?
AchillesAboutReunionQuests01|Achilles About Reunion Quests 01|Zagreus|Achilles... if a friend of yours were in need of assistance, but the only way you could assist them was to somehow change the terms of an ancient pact Father probably forced on them, what would you do?
AchillesAboutReunionQuests01|Achilles About Reunion Quests 01|Achilles|I would be very careful, above all. Do you understand, lad? I would not wish to make things any worse. How many pacts such as the one you're thinking of are buried back in the administrative chamber, there? Even your father can't keep track. Although... perhaps Nyx can.
AchillesAboutReunionQuests01|Achilles About Reunion Quests 01|Zagreus|Nyx... you're right. She knows everything! Wouldn't hurt to ask her, I suppose...
AchillesAboutOffice01|Achilles About Office 01|Achilles|Hold, lad! You've regained access to the administrative chamber, right? I never thought you'd want to go in there again.
AchillesAboutOffice01|Achilles About Office 01|Zagreus|Oh, believe me, I don't. But I would like to be able to go where I please around here, and confounding Father is another benefit.
AchillesAboutOffice01|Achilles About Office 01|Achilles|Suppose I can see that. Well then, on my quite limited authority, it pleases me to say: You may proceed.
AchillesAboutOffice02|Achilles About Office 02|Zagreus|Achilles, now that I have access to the administrative area again, I... well, I've access to the archives, and... I have some authority, to void those, under certain circumstances. So, about your pact...
AchillesAboutOffice02|Achilles About Office 02|Achilles|I know you mean well, lad. And, from the bottom of my heart, where once it was, I thank you truly for the thought. However... don't exert your influence on this. Not now, at least. The Fates can twist intentions. I don't want to take the risk.
AchillesAboutOffice02|Achilles About Office 02|Zagreus|You're sure...? Well then... I'll wait. But I am going to ask you again. We have to find a way to fix this. Patroclus is waiting.
AchillesAboutOrpheus01|Achilles About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|Say, I was wondering, Achilles. Any news of Orpheus of late? I've not seen him around here in some time. He still paying his dues?
AchillesAboutOrpheus01|Achilles About Orpheus 01|Achilles|That I believe he is, lad. Your father, he was none too pleased with him last time I saw him here. I tried my best to simmer down the situation, but... you know how it goes. I hope your father cuts his sentence short.
AchillesAboutOrpheus01|Achilles About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|I hope so, too. If you do see him, tell him I said hi.
AchillesAboutOrpheus02|Achilles About Orpheus 02|Zagreus|Good to see old Orpheus is back with us. He hasn't changed a bit. Was he always like this?
AchillesAboutOrpheus02|Achilles About Orpheus 02|Achilles|I'm guessing not. Never knew him when we were alive, but since we met he's always been the melancholy sort. The few times I heard him sing, though...? It was beautiful. I'm not surprised your father's kept him here.
AchillesWithHades01|Duo - Achilles and Hades (1)|Achilles|...You asked I train him, Master. Prepare him for life's labors. You ordered it! Now you admonish me?
AchillesWithHades01|Duo - Achilles and Hades (1)|Hades|Be careful of your tone and temper, Shade. You are in my employ. You could be wandering the pastures of Elysium again instead. Or lesser planes, if I so choose.
AchillesWithHades01|Duo - Achilles and Hades (1)|Achilles|...What would you have me do?
AchillesWithHades01|Duo - Achilles and Hades (1)|Hades|I shall be giving it some thought. Until then, you just watch that hall. And watch yourself, as well.
AchillesWithHadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Achilles and Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Hades|...I understand the terms of your employment have been altered in my name, Shade. Be grateful that you lack the standing for such changes to require my personal approval. Though you remain in my employ, correct?
AchillesWithHadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Achilles and Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Achilles|As far as I'm aware, yes, Master. I'm sworn eternally here to this House, except... it seems I'm now at liberty to see Elysium, from time to time. While off duty, of course.
AchillesWithHadesAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Achilles and Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Hades|How lenient they make these pacts, today. You are off duty now, is that not so? Go, then, take advantage of the added benefit.
AchillesWithMegaera01|Duo - Achilles and Megaera (1)|Megaera|...What's that you have there, Shade? That looks like contraband to me.
AchillesWithMegaera01|Duo - Achilles and Megaera (1)|Achilles|It is, Mistress. I'm glad you're here, as maybe you can help me quickly to dispose of it.
AchillesWithMegaera01|Duo - Achilles and Megaera (1)|Megaera|Let us immediately do so, then. Before concerns arise around the presence of this stuff within the House.
AchillesWithMegaera02|Duo - Achilles and Megaera (2)|Megaera|...He must be somewhere in Elysium, you know. Where else could he have gone?
AchillesWithMegaera02|Duo - Achilles and Megaera (2)|Achilles|I realize that, Mistress. It's just... I think we've other matters to attend to, such as... emptying the contents of this contraband.
AchillesWithMegaera02|Duo - Achilles and Megaera (2)|Megaera|I see. That's fine. But you will need to face your fears someday, in all of this. You act as if you can't afford to get involved, but it's a little late for that.
AchillesWithMegaeraAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Achilles and Megaera About Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Megaera|...You found him after all? Because of Zag? That's... how very fortunate for you, Shade.
AchillesWithMegaeraAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Achilles and Megaera About Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Achilles|Mistress, for certain it is more than I deserve. Although, perhaps it's for the best that a forgotten shade ought to be put out with the rest of them. I shall not cause you so much trouble, then.
AchillesWithMegaeraAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Achilles and Megaera About Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Megaera|Well, if your journeys take you from this House, then... you are nothing but a Shade, and so... there will be others, but... take care, OK?
AchillesWithPersephone01|Duo - Achilles and Persephone (1)|Persephone|...Honored to have met you, great Achilles, our royal guard! Good to know whom to turn to, should anything run afoul around here. So it was you who instructed my son in the martial ways?
AchillesWithPersephone01|Duo - Achilles and Persephone (1)|Achilles|Indeed, Your Grace. He was a talented student. If only you could have seen his progress. Surely you would have been very proud.
AchillesWithPersephone01|Duo - Achilles and Persephone (1)|Persephone|I *am *proud! You know, you were already quite the name back on the surface when I lived upon Olympus. I should think your legend's spread much farther still, since then!
AchillesWithPersephone01|Duo - Achilles and Persephone (1)|Achilles|Oh, I doubt that... although, thank you, Your Grace.
AchillesChat01|Achilles Chat 01|Achilles|Remember your training, lad.
AchillesChat02|Achilles Chat 02|Achilles|I've not the faintest doubt that you can do this.
AchillesChat03|Achilles Chat 03|Achilles|Go forth, lad, and do as you must.
AchillesChat04|Achilles Chat 04|Achilles|I'll keep an eye on things while you're away.
AchillesChat05|Achilles Chat 05|Achilles|Don't tarry longer than you need to, lad.
AchillesChat06|Achilles Chat 06|Achilles|I've nothing left to teach you, lad.
AchillesChat07|Achilles Chat 07|Achilles|Fight as though you've but one life to live.
AchillesChat08|Achilles Chat 08|Achilles|Fight like I'd fight out there.
AchillesChat09|Achilles Chat 09|Achilles|Don't come back anytime soon if you can help it, lad.
AchillesChat10|Achilles Chat 10|Achilles|Let your instincts take over while you're out there.
AchillesChat11|Achilles Chat 11|Achilles|The House is secure, lad. Go.
AchillesChat12|Achilles Chat 12|Achilles|Experience is the greatest teacher, lad.
AchillesChat13|Achilles Chat 13|Achilles|Get back out and finish what you started, lad.
AchillesChat14|Achilles Chat 14|Achilles|Nyx and I have matters here under control.
AchillesChat15|Achilles Chat 15|Achilles|Mistakes are opportunities for learning, lad.
AchillesChat16|Achilles Chat 16|Achilles|Go to your room, Zagreus.
AchillesChat17|Achilles Chat 17|Achilles|I have your back. No matter what.
AchillesChat18|Achilles Chat 18|Achilles|Ready yourself, lad, and give it another attempt.
AchillesChat19|Achilles Chat 19|Achilles|There's no such thing as lesser gods, lad.
AchillesChat20|Achilles Chat 20|Achilles|If ever there is something I can do, you need but ask.
AchillesChat21|Achilles Chat 21|Achilles|There's nothing you cannot achieve. I'm sure of it.
AchillesChat22|Achilles Chat 22|Achilles|Do not throw away your life as I did mine, lad.
AchillesChat23|Achilles Chat 23|Achilles|It brings me joy knowing you've found something worth fighting for.
AchillesChat24|Achilles Chat 24|Achilles|You have this, lad. The Fates be damned.
AchillesChat25|Achilles Chat 25|Achilles|You have a good heart, lad. Keep listening to it.
AchillesChatWithMegaera01|Duo - Chat and Megaera (1)|Megaera|The Shade here was just regaling me about a famous war.
AchillesChatWithMegaera01|Duo - Chat and Megaera (1)|Achilles|I'm afraid most of my tales revolve around bloodshed for one reason or another...
AchillesChatWithMegaera02|Duo - Chat and Megaera (2)|Megaera|...The spear is competent in the right hands, but it can't stop a whip.
AchillesChatWithMegaera02|Duo - Chat and Megaera (2)|Achilles|I must admit, Mistress, I've not enough experience against such a weapon to refute your claim. Quite fortunately so.
AchillesChatWithMegaera03|Duo - Chat and Megaera (3)|Megaera|...Pour another bottle when you've finished with the one there, Shade.
AchillesChatWithMegaera03|Duo - Chat and Megaera (3)|Achilles|As you say, Mistress! Pardon us, here, lad.
AchillesGift01|Achilles Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey Achilles, look this really isn't much, but... here.
AchillesGift01|Achilles Gift 01|Achilles|This really is for me? You beat me to it, then, as I had meant to give you this when next we spoke. Please, take it.
AchillesGift02|Achilles Gift 02|Achilles|No, this is for me? You really shouldn't have. You're spoiling me rotten...!
AchillesGift02|Achilles Gift 02|Zagreus|I just happen to think you deserve better than you've got down here, Achilles.
AchillesGift03|Achilles Gift 03|Achilles|What, for me...? I can't accept something like this, lad, you know that.
AchillesGift03|Achilles Gift 03|Zagreus|Come on, Achilles, live a little... such as you're able. I won't tell if you won't tell.
AchillesGift04_A|Achilles Gift 04 A|Achilles|*Ah*, now this is something, lad! I'd hate to think that you've returned to bring me this just for my sake. Though I'm grateful, really.
AchillesGift04_A|Achilles Gift 04 A|Zagreus|You've always been there for me, Achilles. Even when Father pushed me away. This is nothing. I don't think I can ever repay you.
AchillesGift05_A|Achilles Gift 05 A|Achilles|Lad, all this generosity, I... don't want you to get the wrong idea. I am alone, yes, but my heart belongs to another. Ever since I was alive. I hope you understand.
AchillesGift05_A|Achilles Gift 05 A|Zagreus|I... somehow knew that was the case, Achilles. I wanted you to have this, anyway, just... don't drown your sorrows, as they seem to make you stronger.
AchillesGift05_A|Achilles Gift 05 A|Achilles|Thank you, then, and do not worry about me. I am long since past my sorrow, and the rage I felt when first my heart was broken. Now it's but another scar. They say it's our scars that give us character.
AchillesGift05_B|Achilles Gift 05 B|Achilles|Lad, all this generosity, I... I'm just an old killer, yet you treat me like I'm the one who's royalty around here. That's about the last thing I would have expected when first I set foot in this House.
AchillesGift05_B|Achilles Gift 05 B|Zagreus|You were a great hero, Achilles, and guess what? You still are! And always will be if you ask me. You deserve so much better than just this. I wish there was more that I could do.
AchillesGift05_B|Achilles Gift 05 B|Achilles|Thank you, then, and do not worry about me. I'm fortunate to be here, and besides... a teacher couldn't have asked for a better pupil.
AchillesGift06_A|Achilles Gift 06 A|Zagreus|Achilles, I was wondering if you'd split this with me at the lounge. A small excuse for both ourselves to take a break?
AchillesGift06_A|Achilles Gift 06 A|Achilles|Are you most certain you have time for me now, lad...? Though, how could I decline. I'll see you there.
AchillesGift06_A|Achilles Gift 06 A|Achilles|...I was a fool, you see. The gods promised me eternal glory beyond death. I could have stayed out of the war. Stayed home with Patroclus. I threw everything away. And sent so very many to this place.
AchillesGift06_A|Achilles Gift 06 A|Zagreus|What's done is done, sir. In my mind you're the greatest warrior who ever lived. So is it glory you still seek, or is it Patroclus?
AchillesGift06_A|Achilles Gift 06 A|Achilles|It isn't glory anymore, lad. I'm sure of that. Patroclus, however, I... fear he's gone to me, forever. Although his shade might yet reside within this realm, we left on terms I'd not forgive if I were him. Though... I had better get back to my post now, I think.
AchillesGift06_A|Achilles Gift 06 A|Achilles|...I hope I didn't cast a greater pall over this place back there. I'm very thankful that we had this chance to get caught up. Now you had best be off! Take care out there.
AchillesGift07_A|Achilles Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Achilles, next time you're in Elysium, I thought this might be something you'd enjoy. That you might share.
AchillesGift07_A|Achilles Gift 07 A|Achilles|Ambrosia... well I am honored, lad, truly. Although it's I who ought to be bestowing thoughtful gifts upon you, for what you've done for me, not the other way around. And, I happen to have one here, on Pat's and my behalf.
AchillesGift08_A|Achilles Gift 08 A|Zagreus|It's hard to think of anybody more deserving of this than you, sir. So when next you are off duty, or whenever the occasion warrants, please, enjoy, all right?
AchillesGift08_A|Achilles Gift 08 A|Achilles|I suppose this must be what it's like to be a god, lad. Being shown affection such as this. And getting offerings! Are you quite sure?
AchillesGift08_A|Achilles Gift 08 A|Zagreus|Oh, I'm absolutely positive. I would never have been remotely prepared for everything I've had to face, if not for all your guidance. And, I don't just mean the violent stuff.
AchillesGift08_A|Achilles Gift 08 A|Achilles|Come now, lad. Admittedly I was quite good at it, but I was nothing other than a killer. I would be wary of all my advice, if I were you.
AchillesGift08_A|Achilles Gift 08 A|Zagreus|See, that's why you give such good advice, right there!
AchillesGift09_A|Achilles Gift 09 A|Zagreus|Here, sir! To you, and to Patroclus. May the remainder of eternity more than make up for everything it took for you to come this far.
AchillesGift09_A|Achilles Gift 09 A|Achilles|Oh, thank you, lad. Prince. Zagreus. You really oughtn't have. In fact, I shall accept this from you once again, but not a bottle more.
AchillesGift09_A|Achilles Gift 09 A|Zagreus|Really? I mean... I meant no offense, of course, it's just... I thought you enjoyed this stuff, no?
AchillesGift09_A|Achilles Gift 09 A|Achilles|We do enjoy it, quite a bit, in fact. But in Elysium... it's something to be earned more than accepted, and, well... perhaps in being there, a bit of our old pride is coming back.
AchillesGift09_A|Achilles Gift 09 A|Zagreus|Well, good. You have much to be proud of, Achilles. You're a great warrior. A great instructor. A great friend.
AchillesGift09_A|Achilles Gift 09 A|Achilles|...If, indeed, I've something to be proud of, lad... it's that someone such as you can say a thing like that to me, and mean it.
AchillesGift04|Achilles Gift 04|Achilles|My word. How very kind of you to think of me with that there, lad.
AchillesGift04|Achilles Gift 04|Zagreus|Least I can do for all your guidance, sir.
AchillesGift07|Achilles Gift 07|Achilles|I'm going to be the envy of the House with this, I thank you, lad. I hope you wouldn't mind if I shared some of it around?
AchillesGift07|Achilles Gift 07|Zagreus|It's yours, Achilles! Though not only do I hope you'll share it, why, I practically insist.
NyxFirstMeeting|Nyx First Meeting|Nyx|Do not despair, child. Such setbacks are inevitable, and may be overcome with effort, and with time. You made contact with the goddess Athena. She shall be true to her word.
NyxFirstMeeting|Nyx First Meeting|Zagreus|I believe it, Nyx. I'm grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out.
NyxFirstMeeting|Nyx First Meeting|Nyx|The risk is not to me. I expected the Olympians would involve themselves in this, eventually. Reveal to them no more than they already know. Are we understood?
NyxFirstMeeting_B|Nyx First Meeting B|Nyx|It pleases me to speak with you at last, child. So the goddess Athena was true to her word. You and she were wise to use discretion in your task.
NyxFirstMeeting_B|Nyx First Meeting B|Zagreus|I believe it, Nyx. I'm grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out.
NyxFirstMeeting_B|Nyx First Meeting B|Nyx|The risk was not to me. It was inevitable that the Olympians would involve themselves in this. The only question was how.
NyxGrantsRespec|Nyx Grants Respec|Nyx|I trust that the Mirror in your bedchamber has proved satisfactory, dear child...?
NyxGrantsRespec|Nyx Grants Respec|Zagreus|Better than I could have possibly imagined, Nyx. You mentioned there was something more that it could do, once I had grown accustomed. I think I'm ready for that now.
NyxGrantsRespec|Nyx Grants Respec|Nyx|I think you are, as well. Then, it shall be as you wish.
NyxMiscMeeting02|Nyx Misc Meeting 02|Nyx|Before you go, my child... your father's mood is rather difficult right now. Perhaps just leave him be.
NyxMiscMeeting04|Nyx Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|Nyx, this may be an odd question, but... do you know what the Fates may have in store for me? They are your daughters, right?
NyxMiscMeeting04|Nyx Misc Meeting 04|Nyx|The Three Fates are my daughters, yes, my child. However, I am no more privy to their workings than the naive mortals living up above. Not even the Olympians can know the weavings of the Fates.
NyxMiscMeeting05|Nyx Misc Meeting 05|Nyx|Darkness guide you, child. You have outgrown this House, of that I am now certain. Should you return again here, I shall keep you safe.
NyxMiscMeeting05|Nyx Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|I won't forget you, Nyx. I swear it.
NyxBackstory01|Nyx Backstory 01|Zagreus|Somehow, I always knew. You know... that you were not my birthmother. I mean, look at Hypnos and Thanatos. There's no way that I could have been related to *them*, everybody knew, and yet... when I finally learned for certain, it was still a shock.
NyxBackstory01|Nyx Backstory 01|Nyx|I always knew, in turn, that you would learn the truth of it, eventually. And I was fearful of what would occur after that time arrived. I'm grateful it has come and gone. Though, tell me. I still find I call you child. Is your preference that I cease to use such terms, from this point on?
NyxBackstory01|Nyx Backstory 01|Zagreus|No, Nyx, please, it's... quite all right. You may not have given birth to me, but you still cared for me. I never doubt that. Likewise, are you sure it's all right that I continue to address you by name?
NyxBackstory02|Nyx Backstory 02|Zagreus|Nyx, you must know something about why Father broke off ties with the Olympians, don't you?
NyxBackstory02|Nyx Backstory 02|Nyx|That is a question only your father can answer, child. I cannot tell you more than you already know.
NyxAboutHades01|Nyx About Hades 01|Zagreus|I have to ask you something, Nyx. What is this debt you owe my father, anyway? Forgive my eavesdropping, it's just, I heard the two of you discussing things, and... it came up.
NyxAboutHades01|Nyx About Hades 01|Nyx|...I was here long before your father. The responsibility to govern fell to me. Yet, I could not manage on my own. I shape the darkness; ensure the integrity of the domain. I am less prone to census-taking and administering rules. I receded from such responsibilities.
NyxAboutHades01|Nyx About Hades 01|Zagreus|It was too much, even for you. So... when father arrived... you welcomed him? He helped?
NyxAboutHades01|Nyx About Hades 01|Nyx|I was quite skeptical of him, at first. I thought his presence merely a cruel trick of Fate. But... he worked diligently, from the start. Soon there was order where once there was none. I fashioned this House for him, and I maintain it still. We remain in partnership. In interdependency.
NyxAboutHades01|Nyx About Hades 01|Zagreus|He has never taken advantage of you? Of your generosity?
NyxAboutHades01|Nyx About Hades 01|Nyx|No, child. He has not. He can be short with me, as you have seen. But that is the extent of it. We have found ways to reconcile disagreements. Though, your relationship with him... it is more complicated than my own, I fear...
NyxAboutHades02|Nyx About Hades 02|Zagreus|Nyx, all you've done to help me, with the Olympians, the Mirror, the House Contractor, I... I worry that if Father were to know, that he would turn his wrath upon you. I don't want anything to happen.
NyxAboutHades02|Nyx About Hades 02|Nyx|You need not fear for me, my child. For I am not some underling your father has authority to punish if it pleases him. I am the Night; and it is by my grace that this House stands. Your father knows this. Thus, he and I have certain common goals. We are obligated to cooperate.
NyxAboutHades02|Nyx About Hades 02|Zagreus|Then... if there's really nothing he can do, why go along with his deception? About my birthmother, I mean?
NyxAboutHades02|Nyx About Hades 02|Nyx|Please... that is something I am not at liberty to say. When you meet your birthmother eventually... you shall understand.
NyxAboutHades02_B|Nyx About Hades 02 B|Zagreus|Nyx, all you've done to help me, with the Olympians, the Mirror, the House Contractor, I... I worry that if Father were to know, that he would turn his wrath upon you. I don't want anything to happen.
NyxAboutHades02_B|Nyx About Hades 02 B|Nyx|You need not fear for me, my child. For I am not some underling your father has authority to punish if it pleases him. I am the Night; and it is by my grace that this House stands. Your father knows this. Thus, he and I have certain common goals. We are obligated to cooperate.
NyxAboutHades02_B|Nyx About Hades 02 B|Zagreus|Obligated to cooperate... no wonder I thought you two truly were husband and wife.
NyxAboutHades02_B|Nyx About Hades 02 B|Nyx|Your father and I... sometimes convince ourselves.
NyxAboutAthena01|Nyx About Athena 01|Zagreus|I heard lately from the goddess Athena, Nyx. She seems to admire you. I thought Olympians didn't like our kind?
NyxAboutAthena01|Nyx About Athena 01|Nyx|They typically do not. But, you are family, child. And I, why... I believed Athena wise enough to understand why someone such as I would seek her, in particular. She has, in turn, made others in her family aware.
NyxAboutAthena02|Nyx About Athena 02|Zagreus|Athena sends you her kindest regards, Nyx. Sounds like you have maintained some correspondence since all this began?
NyxAboutAthena02|Nyx About Athena 02|Nyx|We have, thank you, my child. Goddess Athena is reputed to be wise, and so she was the one I felt was the most likely to listen to reason, understand my view, and ultimately have a willingness to help. It is most fortunate that I was not mistaken about her.
NyxAboutAthena02|Nyx About Athena 02|Zagreus|But... you told her you're my mother. If she's supposedly so wise... isn't that quite a risk? If she finds out you've been misleading her...
NyxAboutAthena02|Nyx About Athena 02|Nyx|She *is *wise, child. It is precisely for that reason I expected she would understand.
NyxAboutAres01|Nyx About Ares 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Nyx, at first I thought I maybe should ignore this, but I wanted to give you greetings from Lord Ares, who seems rather interested in you.
NyxAboutAres01|Nyx About Ares 01|Nyx|*Ah*, yes, the god of war. Among all the Olympians, he often struck me as much more accepting of our kind, born of the Underworld.
NyxAboutAres01|Nyx About Ares 01|Zagreus|You're not... wait, you're not interested in him, I mean, he's... murderous... polite, though, I don't know.
NyxAboutAres01|Nyx About Ares 01|Nyx|I take an interest in whomever I take interest in, my child. I thank you for the message.
NyxAboutAres02|Nyx About Ares 02|Zagreus|Hey, Nyx, *erm*, Lord Ares wanted you to know, and I believe I quote, that *'I am often thinking of her here'*. Take that for what it's worth?
NyxAboutAres02|Nyx About Ares 02|Nyx|I shall, thank you, my child. If the god of war is thus preoccupied with me, well then, perhaps he shall be slower to send droves of mortals to our doorstep here.
NyxAboutAres03|Nyx About Ares 03|Zagreus|Help me, Nyx. Or rather, help yourself. Lord Ares seeks for me to put the two of you in contact. I mean... I don't know why I'm getting so defensive, here, now that I think on it.
NyxAboutAres03|Nyx About Ares 03|Nyx|Do not concern yourself with my ability to navigate my interpersonal relationships, my child. It pleases me Lord Ares told you this. Those of Olympus rarely say such things, to any of us here.
NyxAboutAres04|Nyx About Ares 04|Zagreus|Nyx, did you really start a *correspondence *with Lord Ares, as he put it to me recently? Is everything all right with you and him?
NyxAboutAres04|Nyx About Ares 04|Nyx|His interest in the Underworld is genuine, and he does not regard me as beneath him, even if the technicality exists. The Olympians and the chthonic gods... we have much left to learn of one another's kind.
NyxAboutAres04|Nyx About Ares 04|Zagreus|What of Father? He's forbidden any contact whatsoever!
NyxAboutAres04|Nyx About Ares 04|Nyx|You have repeatedly received such contact, all despite your father's wishes, child.
NyxAboutAres05|Nyx About Ares 05|Zagreus|You're going to meet Ares, sometime, Nyx? Or maybe you already have?
NyxAboutAres05|Nyx About Ares 05|Nyx|What is your concern, exactly, child? Speak plain with me, or else take not my time.
NyxAboutAres05|Nyx About Ares 05|Zagreus|Well, I... it's just, Ares, he's... I don't know, he just doesn't seem your type! And isn't he a little young for you?
NyxAboutAres05|Nyx About Ares 05|Nyx|You do not understand the basis of our friendship, child. Lord Ares may not meet the moral standard of the mortals who hate him, or Olympians who shun him, but to me? He is cordial and eager to learn. I am quite capable of forming my own views on him.
NyxAboutAres06|Nyx About Ares 06|Zagreus|*Erm*, Nyx, I... Ares sends you his regards again. Wanted to let you know.
NyxAboutAres06|Nyx About Ares 06|Nyx|Thank you, my child. We may seldom have occasion to encounter one another, he and I, but it is good to have another friend upon Olympus. Even if goddess Athena and he are not on the best of terms.
NyxAboutBoons01|Nyx About Boons 01|Zagreus|The Olympians can't really see me, can they, Nyx? I mean, not very well. I get that they can sense details here and there, but... they don't know the full extent of what's going on. Are we really so far beyond their influence?
NyxAboutBoons01|Nyx About Boons 01|Nyx|You are enshrouded from them, child. For your own benefit, and theirs. They know as much as necessary to assist. And I trust they shall, for as long as you require. They are bound to one another as family. And they know that you require aid. Do not be too prideful to accept.
NyxAboutOrpheus01|Nyx About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|I was pleased to see an order pending approval for the release of Orpheus with the House Contractor, Nyx. If Father wants him to start singing again, locking him in Tartarus doesn't seem like the most efficient way to go about it. Besides, I think he's suffered enough.
NyxAboutOrpheus01|Nyx About Orpheus 01|Nyx|Your father found a certain peace from song, my child. Perhaps with this reprieve, our Orpheus shall reconsider and resume his craft.
NyxAboutOrpheus01|Nyx About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|You're worried Father doesn't have enough live music to enjoy while brooding over his gloomy court?
NyxAboutOrpheus01|Nyx About Orpheus 01|Nyx|Your father's temperament is easier to navigate when he is in relatively better spirits. And my opinion is that punishing the court musician does not further your father's goal with him.
NyxAboutOrpheus02|Nyx About Orpheus 02|Zagreus|Do you enjoy Orpheus' singing, Nyx? He seems a bit concerned that you might not.
NyxAboutOrpheus02|Nyx About Orpheus 02|Nyx|I am amenable to the consonance of his harmonies, child.
NyxAboutSkelly01|Nyx About Skelly 01|Zagreus|I don't suppose the name *Skelly *happens to mean anything to you, does it, Nyx?
NyxAboutSkelly01|Nyx About Skelly 01|Nyx|It means nothing to me at all, my child. Though, why do you invoke such names within this House? Who is this Skelly, and what do you presume is the connection that exists between us?
NyxAboutSkelly01|Nyx About Skelly 01|Zagreus|*Oh*, I... well, essentially, he is an animated skeleton who shows up just outside my bedchambers, and lets me practice with my weapons on him. I sort of figured that *you *put him up to it. So it wasn't you?
NyxAboutSkelly01|Nyx About Skelly 01|Nyx|Achilles moves throughout these chambers under my own shroud, if you must know. And thus you have in your possession the Infernal Arms. But, I have not exerted further influence than that. Is this skeleton to be trusted, then?
NyxRunNotCleared01|Nyx Run Not Cleared 01|Zagreus|I finally made it to the surface, Nyx! Confronted Father, there, out in the cold. I couldn't make it past him, but... I was so close!
NyxRunNotCleared01|Nyx Run Not Cleared 01|Nyx|Do not despair, as I told you before. With effort and with time, most any setback can be overcome. Even your father. You have come closer to your goal. Achieve it!
NyxRunNotCleared02|Nyx Run Not Cleared 02|Nyx|Your father is not here, and you are back. Then, it can only mean one thing. Are you all right, my child?
NyxRunNotCleared02|Nyx Run Not Cleared 02|Zagreus|Yes, I think so, Nyx. Returning here by Father's hand does put a special sting into it, though. So, any invaluable tips on how to vanquish him? Some hidden weaknesses only you know about, something like that?
NyxRunNotCleared02|Nyx Run Not Cleared 02|Nyx|You know his weaknesses better than anyone. Better even than he. It pains me to know that the conflict between you could not be settled in some other way. But if this is how it has to be... destroy him for me, next you fight up there. However long it takes. Would you do that?
NyxAboutPact01|Nyx About Pact 01|Nyx|You have been served a Pact of Punishment, now, child. I thought to talk your father out of it, at first, but... it may serve to let you grow your power, even more.
NyxAboutPact01|Nyx About Pact 01|Zagreus|Something about setbacks building character, I guess? I didn't take you for someone to look on the bright side of things, Nyx.
NyxAboutPact01|Nyx About Pact 01|Nyx|It is a point of fact. If you can overcome the conditions of the Pact, your influence throughout this realm shall surely grow. Though, do not overextend, of course.
NyxAboutFlowers01|Nyx About Flowers 01|Nyx|I thank you for the lovely flowers, child. They make my corner of the House hospitable. Such simple comforts never were for me, and yet... now that I am surrounded by them, I have found that I enjoy their presence, more than I would have admitted in the past.
NyxAboutFlowers01|Nyx About Flowers 01|Zagreus|I'm glad you like them, Nyx. Though if you don't, just give the word, and I will have them removed. Probably incinerated for good measure! Now that you mention it, though, how come you are always in this corner in particular?
NyxAboutFlowers01|Nyx About Flowers 01|Nyx|This point is closest to the center of the House. To its foundation. And, therefore, to the center of the entire realm.
NyxAboutHerself01|Nyx About Herself 01|Zagreus|Don't you ever get lonely down here, Nyx...? For companionship, I mean, because... I mean, just look at you, you're very beautiful, the night herself! There's nothing you can't do. When I was younger, I thought you and father, you know, but... is there not someone else?
NyxAboutHerself01|Nyx About Herself 01|Nyx|How very forward of you, child. I accept your compliment. Although, I am the Night, as you observe. The night conceals all. I know nothing of the loneliness which you describe. This entire realm... it is a part of me. And many of its subjects sprang from me, alone.
NyxDarknessProgress01|Nyx Darkness Progress 01|Nyx|You appear to have grown stronger since when last we interacted, child. Your bedroom mirror may appear to be the cause... but then of course the real cause is you.
NyxDarknessProgress02|Nyx Darkness Progress 02|Nyx|I sense the growing darkness in you, child. I am so very proud of you. You always have been capable, yet now, you seem to radiate with newfound power.
NyxDarknessProgress03|Nyx Darkness Progress 03|Nyx|The unfathomable power of the Underworld thrives within you, child. Your godliness has grown since last we spoke; you have learned much of harnessing the dark.
NyxDarknessProgress04|Nyx Darkness Progress 04|Nyx|Even among those born longest ago within the deepest reaches of the Underworld... I have seldom encountered anyone so united with the Darkness of this domain as you are, child.
NyxDarknessProgress04|Nyx Darkness Progress 04|Zagreus|United with the Darkness? I've just... been picking it up here and there. Although, for quite a while, since you mention it! I'm not sure that I feel any different, though.
NyxDarknessProgress04|Nyx Darkness Progress 04|Nyx|Surely that is not so. Think back on when you started all of this. You now know so much more. Are capable of so much more.
NyxMirrorProgressComplete01|Nyx Mirror Progress Complete 01|Nyx|You have revealed every facet of the Mirror of Night, child. The full extent of its power. I was aware this was possible, yet... you achieved it sooner than expected.
NyxMirrorProgressComplete01|Nyx Mirror Progress Complete 01|Zagreus|I don't know where I'd be without it. Probably still in Tartarus trying to get past Meg. I only wish I could get even stronger.
NyxMirrorProgressComplete01|Nyx Mirror Progress Complete 01|Nyx|The Mirror has little to do with your power, let alone your capability. You may deactivate its effects and see for yourself. It merely gave you greater opportunity to learn. And you shall continue to do so.
NyxPostFlashback01|Nyx Post Flashback 01|Zagreus|Nyx... I have to ask you something. Are you certain that my search isn't in vain? My mother, what if... what if she's gone?
NyxPostFlashback01|Nyx Post Flashback 01|Nyx|Your mother yet lives. There can be no other explanation. For, if she did not, she would be with us, here.... She was a good woman. Stately, kind. I wished to raise you as I thought she would have.
NyxPostFlashback02|Nyx Post Flashback 02|Zagreus|Nyx, sometimes I get the impression the Olympians look down on those of us born of the Underworld. Is that my imagination, or, what do you make of it?
NyxPostFlashback02|Nyx Post Flashback 02|Nyx|The gods of Mount Olympus tend to think themselves above us, child. Or so your father often likes to say. He alone was relegated to this realm, and grew resentful of his relatives on high.
NyxAboutOlympians01|Nyx About Olympians 01|Nyx|You have met most of your Olympian relatives by now, child. Although the power of their blessings is fleeting here, they shall continue to support you. As long as necessary.
NyxAboutOlympians01|Nyx About Olympians 01|Zagreus|They all still think I'm headed to join them on Olympus. That's why they're helping me.
NyxAboutOlympians01|Nyx About Olympians 01|Nyx|They are helping you because you are family. Family with whom they do not yet have a complicated past.
NyxAboutOlympians02|Nyx About Olympians 02|Zagreus|Nyx... the Olympians have been immensely helpful, but... did they really have to get mixed up in all this? I could have gone off on my own.
NyxAboutOlympians02|Nyx About Olympians 02|Nyx|And you would not have gone far, child. Your father is too proud to accept assistance in personal matters. Do not cede the advantage that you have.
NyxAboutOlympians02|Nyx About Olympians 02|Zagreus|But I'm misleading them. Taking advantage of their good graces trying to find Mother. What if they find out?
NyxAboutOlympians02|Nyx About Olympians 02|Nyx|I shall do everything within my power to prevent this, as shall you.
NyxAboutPersephone01|Nyx About Persephone 01|Zagreus|Nyx, can you... tell me more about my birthmother? Anything at all. What was she like, when you first met? What did you think of her?
NyxAboutPersephone01|Nyx About Persephone 01|Nyx|Your birthmother left a strong impression on us, child. It was apparent she was from a far-off place, and yet... she brought with her a lightness I had not experienced before. My first impression soon subsided, and I grew to care for her. You possess many of her finer qualities.
NyxAboutPersephone01|Nyx About Persephone 01|Zagreus|Finer qualities? Such as abandoning her family members? Why did she leave? Why won't you tell me?
NyxAboutPersephone01|Nyx About Persephone 01|Nyx|Please... you must not ask such things of me. I swore a binding oath never to say. I have already circumvented it as much as can be done. Go find her, child. Then, you shall understand.
NyxAboutPersephone02|Nyx About Persephone 02|Zagreus|Nyx, if I can ever make my way from here, out to the surface... how do you know that I can find her? The instructions you gave me... how can you know for sure that's where she is, that she hasn't left, or...?
NyxAboutPersephone02|Nyx About Persephone 02|Nyx|When your birthmother departed, I bent the light for her, shrouding her path, though I myself could see it. I trust she remains there, and that I am not betraying her confidence by telling you.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01|Nyx|Your father fell to you, as once his father fell to him. Although, you were substantially more merciful. I know it is a bitter victory, at best. Though, tell me... what transpired subsequently, that you have returned? Did you locate your birthmother?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|I did, I... she was there. She was... where you said she'd be. And, more than I imagined, but... I had so little time with her. I can't survive up there, for very long. Why didn't you tell me I'd just die, no matter what?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01|Nyx|Oh, my child... I say this seldomly, but... I did not know. Or... I did not wish to believe... that the surface would have such an effect on you. But it seems you share your father's fate, after all.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|My father's fate? But he is smugly waiting for me every single time I make it there, and seems quite healthy by then, all in all! Though... maybe the farther we get from this realm... the worse we get. Because he cast his lot... inheriting the Underworld?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01|Nyx|So I now presume. You are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine. Tell me something... if you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time... would you still make the journey to her, there?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|...Yes. Yes, I would. I had so many questions left for her!
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01|Nyx|Then, go and ask them, child. Steady your resolve, and find her there, again. And use well what brief time you have with one another, whilst you can. As mortals do.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01B|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01 B|Nyx|Your father fell to you, as once his father fell to him. Although, you were substantially more merciful. I know it is a bitter victory, at best. Though, tell me... what transpired subsequently, that you have returned? Did you locate your birthmother?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01B|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01 B|Zagreus|I did, I... she was there. She was... where you said she'd be. And, more than I imagined, but... I had so little time with her. I can't survive up there, for very long. Why didn't you tell me I'd just die, no matter what?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01B|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01 B|Nyx|Oh, my child... I say this seldomly, but... I did not know. Or... I did not wish to believe... that the surface would have such an effect on you. But it seems you share your father's fate, after all.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01B|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01 B|Zagreus|My father's fate? But he was smugly waiting for me up there, and seemed quite healthy, all in all! Though... maybe the farther we get from this realm... the worse we get. Because he cast his lot... inheriting the Underworld?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01B|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01 B|Nyx|So I now presume. You are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine. Tell me something... if you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time... would you still make the journey to her, there?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01B|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01 B|Zagreus|...Yes. Yes, I would. I had so many questions left for her!
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting01B|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 01 B|Nyx|Then, go and ask them, child. Steady your resolve, and find her there, again. And use well what brief time you have with one another, whilst you can. As mortals do.
NyxAboutPersephonePact01|Nyx About Persephone Pact 01|Zagreus|Nyx... why did you never send word to Mother that I lived? You knew at least approximately where she went. You and Father... you could have spared her so much pain!
NyxAboutPersephonePact01|Nyx About Persephone Pact 01|Nyx|I swore a binding oath never to say, child. I have already circumvented it as much as can be done. Know that we... that *I *acted with only her wellbeing in mind. As well as yours.
NyxAfterPersephoneMeeting02|Nyx After Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Nyx... you saved my life. Gave me life. When I was born. Father told me. I don't know what to say. Why didn't you tell me?
NyxAfterPersephoneMeeting02|Nyx After Persephone Meeting 02|Nyx|There are many things that I am not at liberty to speak of, child. Through my own binding choice. These circumstances are among them. Suffice it to say that your revival... required the extent of my ability. And considerable time.
NyxAfterPersephoneMeeting02|Nyx After Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|I never should have been born... is that what the Fates wanted? Did you defy your own daughters?
NyxAfterPersephoneMeeting02|Nyx After Persephone Meeting 02|Nyx|Silence. Tempt not my daughters thus.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 03|Nyx|How is she, child? Queen Persephone, I mean. Has she been well up there, in her abode? What is it like?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|She's doing well, I think. It's nice to visit her. Her residence is beautiful. A little home nestled amid the cold. All of these plants, in bloom! It's difficult even to describe. And very bright, as well.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 03|Nyx|That sounds quite pleasant for someone who values brightness, I suppose. Well, then... I trust your visits are worthwhile for the both of you.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 05|Zagreus|Nyx, my mother was quite concerned to learn Olympus has been aiding me. Did you... haven't you... put her in danger by involving them? Was there no other way?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 05|Nyx|No. There was not. She has been in danger, all along. I concealed her, yes. Even from me. But, it is not enough. I do not think that you could have found her without the Olympians. And, if I did not reveal your existence to them... if they discovered who you are... it would be worse.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 05|Zagreus|*Ugh*, what a mess. How are we going to fix this?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting05|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 05|Nyx|The Olympians maintain belief that you are trying to reach them. I trust we can sustain this understanding for a long, long time. Perhaps not forever, but... long enough to discover a solution. Perhaps with your birthmother's help.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 06|Nyx|Child, quickly now, before you go. I know how all of this must look. Know that I was true to her. Persephone. And, that I think fondly on the time she spent with us.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 06|Zagreus|Of course, Nyx, though... why did she really leave the Underworld, do you think? Besides because of me. So what if she thought I died at birth?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 06|Nyx|She did not feel that she belonged. It was a very difficult adjustment she was forced to make. And... she feared that she would inevitably end up caught between Olympus and this realm. That she might start a war.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 06|Zagreus|A war... wars have been fought for less, I understand. And, Father must have been a real burden, too.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting06|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 06|Nyx|You do not know. Ask her yourself, about her time with him. But... I have already said too much. And I cannot say more.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting07|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 07|Nyx|What is the matter, child? I sense your distress, not the specific cause.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting07|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 07|Zagreus|Mother doesn't want to see me again. I mean... she asked me not to return. Thinks the risk is too great.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting07|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 07|Nyx|*Oh*. That is a fair-enough assessment. What shall you do?
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting07|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 07|Zagreus|...I'm going back.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting09|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 09|Zagreus|Father loved her, didn't he? Mother, I mean. Faith like that... he's just stubborn enough to hold onto the idea of her, isn't he? Though, what she saw in him, I'm not sure.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting09|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 09|Nyx|Your father was different with Persephone, to some extent. He has always been as you know him, yet... her lightness... it affected even him, I think. And he knows... that he was better with her, than without.
NyxAboutPersephoneMeeting09|Nyx About Persephone Meeting 09|Zagreus|Sounds like a lot of pressure on Mother to fix all his failings... but, it sounds as though she cared for him, as well. And you, and Cerberus. She said she misses you.
NyxAboutObscurity01|Nyx About Obscurity 01|Zagreus|Nyx, why is it the mortals come here knowing all about Olympus, while knowing so little about what goes on in our realm? Is there something more we could be doing to help spread the word?
NyxAboutObscurity01|Nyx About Obscurity 01|Nyx|This realm remains enshrouded and obscure by my design and by your father's will, my child. Tell me, what would be the benefit of the attention you would seek?
NyxAboutObscurity01|Nyx About Obscurity 01|Zagreus|Oh, I... I don't know, it's just, for all the famous gods and monsters and the like, it seems to me that someone such as you, who does so much, why... you should be at least as known as any one of them!
NyxAboutObscurity01|Nyx About Obscurity 01|Nyx|Obscurity is not a weakness, child. Are we understood? Seek to be valuable, not to be known. If you are valuable, then fame or notoriety can be a consequence. Should they become a burden... I can help.
NyxRunProgress01|Nyx Run Progress 01|Nyx|You have encountered setbacks within Asphodel, have you not, child? The Bloodless shades residing there are eager to bring death to any form of life. Beware of their infernal power.
NyxRunProgress02|Nyx Run Progress 02|Nyx|You have confronted the Exalted Shades within Elysium, my child. Your father offers them a handsome bounty should they bring your journey to an end. Although, I think the pride of vanquishing you would more than suffice in getting them to take up arms again.
NyxRunProgress03|Nyx Run Progress 03|Nyx|You nearly gained the surface, child. Considerable progress. Though, the setbacks that you faced within the Temple... if it is of any consolation, the foes you faced there have been quite a burden to your father, too.
NyxRunProgress03|Nyx Run Progress 03|Zagreus|What, Father can't control the pest problem? Never thought I'd be of any help rampaging through the upper levels of his domain.
NyxAboutQuestLog01|Nyx About Quest Log 01|Nyx|I saw you took possession of the List of Minor Prophecies, of the Three Fates. As ever, I should never have doubted my daughters' expectations. I was uncertain you had necessary guidance to select it from among the House Contractor's many opportunities.
NyxAboutQuestLog01|Nyx About Quest Log 01|Zagreus|You offer something called the *Fated List of Minor Prophecies *to me, chances are I'm going to pick it up. Though, you make it sound like there's more I should know about it. Should I be concerned?
NyxAboutQuestLog01|Nyx About Quest Log 01|Nyx|You know exactly what is necessary, and no more. I know better than anyone never to tamper with the Fates' design. Though, if they had cruelty in store for you through their List... I think that I would warn you, anyway.
NyxAboutQuestLog02|Nyx About Quest Log 02|Nyx|You have fulfilled already many prophecies envisioned by my daughters, child. Although perhaps inevitable, I find it impressive, nonetheless.
NyxAboutQuestLog02|Nyx About Quest Log 02|Zagreus|Thank you, Nyx. Though, they're just *minor *prophecies, right? The kind that won't necessarily come to pass unless spelled out and coupled with a decent reward to make it worth my while. Not even the Fates are above greasing the wheels of progress, then?
NyxAboutQuestLog02|Nyx About Quest Log 02|Nyx|The Fates have perfect knowledge of exactly what is necessary for the future they have woven to someday come to pass. We each are instrumental to their ultimate design. Some more than others, it would seem, of course.
NyxAboutQuestLog03|Nyx About Quest Log 03|Nyx|I sense all of the minor prophecies described within the Fated List have been fulfilled...? I do not understand how that is possible.
NyxAboutQuestLog03|Nyx About Quest Log 03|Zagreus|Well, it certainly took some doing, and several of those really were rather difficult, and took some time, but... what's so special about getting through them all? It's a list, right?
NyxAboutQuestLog03|Nyx About Quest Log 03|Nyx|The Fates are always at their weaving. To have caught up with their designs... well, I should think that they shall have to learn to weave a little faster, perhaps.
NyxAboutQuestLog03|Nyx About Quest Log 03|Zagreus|Any new prophecies need fulfilling, they know where to find me.
NyxAboutGhostAdmin01|Nyx About Ghost Admin 01|Nyx|What is it, child? Is something amiss?
NyxAboutGhostAdmin01|Nyx About Ghost Admin 01|Zagreus|No, it's just... the latest renovations from the Contractor... Father told me you've been supervising all of that. Look, just between us, and I'll not speak of it again, but... thanks. So much.
NyxAboutGhostAdmin01|Nyx About Ghost Admin 01|Nyx|*Ah*. Yes, no need to speak of it again. Though, I am pleased to oblige.
NyxAboutGhostAdmin02|Nyx About Ghost Admin 02|Nyx|This House is not a place of cheer, child. A certain severity always struck me as appropriate, if not necessary, given our role.
NyxAboutGhostAdmin02|Nyx About Ghost Admin 02|Zagreus|Is this about all the House Contractor decorations? Look, it's one thing if Father objects, but if you do as well... just tell me, and I can have it taken down.
NyxAboutGhostAdmin02|Nyx About Ghost Admin 02|Nyx|You misunderstand. I am grateful. These changes... I would not have commissioned them, myself. But, seeing them now... I appreciate their presence. You have a discerning eye.
NyxAboutOffice01|Nyx About Office 01|Zagreus|Nyx, if, hypothetically, I felt that some injustice had been dealt to someone who deserved a better lot... say, that they were subjected to too harsh a punishment for all eternity... don't I have some of my father's authority to do something about it?
NyxAboutOffice01|Nyx About Office 01|Nyx|Now that you have regained your access privileges to the administrative chamber, child, yes; that is a level of authority you hypothetically possess, again.
NyxAboutOffice01|Nyx About Office 01|Zagreus|But how can I possibly find anything in there? The place is wall-to-wall pacts and parchments. I've no idea where to look.
NyxAboutOffice01|Nyx About Office 01|Nyx|You can be made aware. Though, use discretion, if and when you need to exercise this power. And make certain that the time is right. Now, are we understood?
NyxAboutOffice02|Nyx About Office 02|Zagreus|Never thought that the administrative chamber would have been so invaluable, Nyx. Though, I have you to thank for all of it.
NyxAboutOffice02|Nyx About Office 02|Nyx|Nonsense, child. Our records must be kept up-to-date. You merely observed that several were long past due. Not even your father can argue with that.
NyxAboutDemeter01|Nyx About Demeter 01|Zagreus|Nyx... I encountered Demeter. She mentioned her daughter... *Persephone*. You never said she was my grandmother. Didn't you think... under the circumstances... that was something I should know?
NyxAboutDemeter01|Nyx About Demeter 01|Nyx|...Listen to me, child. What you know, or do not know, is for your protection. Your protection, and your birthmother's, as well. Your suspicion and your curiosity are warranted. But I can do no more about them, now, except to caution you. Are we understood?
NyxAboutHermes01|Nyx About Hermes 01|Zagreus|Nyx, I've come to know the god of swiftness, Hermes, though... it seems to me he doesn't work directly with the others on Olympus. Do you know him well?
NyxAboutHermes01|Nyx About Hermes 01|Nyx|Lord Hermes is a point of contact, yes. Among Olympians he works the closest with our operations here, and aids with shepherding the souls of the departed to our gates. Accept his help; for he is faithful to our cause.
NyxAboutChildren01|Nyx About Children 01|Zagreus|Someday I'd like to meet more of your children, Nyx. Eris, Nemesis... Thanatos told me of several others. Have they ever visited the House?
NyxAboutChildren01|Nyx About Children 01|Nyx|No. They are required elsewhere. It is for the best. Some of my children are not on speaking terms with one another, or with me. As a mother... one has her victories, and her defeats.
NyxAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Nyx About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Zagreus|Nyx, I was just busy doing some administrative chamber record-keeping recently, and, wouldn't you know, it somehow slipped my mind where I could find the sentencing parchmentwork for the knave-king Sisyphus, forced to toil out in Tartarus? I ran it by Megaera...
NyxAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Nyx About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Nyx|He has offered you aid, repeatedly. At first I saw it for a brazen act of bribery, but... try as I might, there was no deeper underpinning to his actions that I could detect. That is to say... the records you seek may be found in section sigma-phi-alpha, lower gamma folder.
NyxAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest02|Nyx About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 02|Zagreus|I waived the punishment-sentence for Sisyphus the knave-king, Nyx, except... he chose to stay! He chose to stay, in Tartarus, I think in part because he likes getting to speak with me, from time to time! Also his boulder friend.
NyxAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest02|Nyx About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 02|Nyx|That sounds to be an agreeable outcome for him. Though, his liberty is not the end of his rehabilitation. As his friend... please make certain he does not run afoul again of your father, child.
NyxAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Nyx About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Nyx, you ever have a burning urge to find the case files for the circumstances under which our court-musician bound himself to eternal servitude here in this House, and forever lost his opportunity to be with his beloved muse? I was wondering if you had a remedy for that.
NyxAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Nyx About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Nyx|Our court musician brings a certain peace to this abode, my child. But, you may discover, once you find his case files in section zeta-pi-omega, upper beta folder, that the consequences that he suffers may be quite in excess of his trespasses...
NyxAboutSingersReunionQuest02|Nyx About Singers Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|You don't know how pleased I was to see Orpheus visiting with his muse Eurydice over in Asphodel. Best of all... I don't think he's left for good. He'll just have some time to visit her now and again! Thank you, Nyx, on their behalf, and mine.
NyxAboutSingersReunionQuest02|Nyx About Singers Reunion Quest 02|Nyx|You need not thank me, child. Your actions made this outcome possible. I merely did what anyone in my position would have done.
NyxAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Nyx About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|I, *ah*, happened to be looking into our security situation here, just running background checks, that sort of thing, and... I was wondering if you could help me locate an old pact signed by... signed by Achilles, Nyx. It would mean a lot... not just to him, but me.
NyxAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Nyx About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Nyx|Achilles... We would struggle to put someone comparable in his role. Though, be that as it may... epsilon-iota-theta. Rho folder, middle, I believe. You are certain about this, child?
NyxAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Nyx About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|I saw Achilles with Patroclus in Elysium, Nyx. They're free to be together, now, thanks to you. If only you could have seen them.
NyxAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Nyx About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Nyx|Oh, I can see them, my child, and I have. And it pleases me Achilles has earned some degree of respite from his servitude, for all his loyalty to our House. For what you have done for him, thank you.
NyxAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Nyx About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|Father isn't going to be thrilled I've let him out of a binding pact.
NyxAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Nyx About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Nyx|Your father is committed to his rules, and you released Achilles from his pact according to those rules. There is not much that even he can do about it save to have Achilles sign again.
NyxAboutEnding01|Nyx About Ending 01|Nyx|Persephone, the Queen... she has returned! I scarce believe it, child. You have brought her back, to all of us.
NyxAboutEnding01|Nyx About Ending 01|Zagreus|I scarce believe it, too. What happens now? Pick up the pieces and begin again?
NyxAboutEnding02|Nyx About Ending 02|Zagreus|How has it been for you of late, Nyx? Having Mother here again, for old time's sake?
NyxAboutEnding02|Nyx About Ending 02|Nyx|Though reminiscent of an older time, it is now very different, child. For one thing... you are present, now. Unlike before.
NyxAboutEnding02|Nyx About Ending 02|Zagreus|Oh, right. So, are you getting on OK, is everything all right?
NyxAboutEnding02|Nyx About Ending 02|Nyx|Everything is all right. Your birthmother... Persephone... her presence has been welcome here, I think.
NyxAboutEnding03|Nyx About Ending 03|Nyx|Congratulations on your new responsibilities, my child. So, you have reason to rise from here to the surface, still.
NyxAboutEnding03|Nyx About Ending 03|Zagreus|It's more of a formality, I think. My responsibilities, such as they are, remain quite similar to those that got me to this point. But thank you, Nyx. It's strange... to think that I can serve the House, by trying to break from it, time after time.
NyxAboutEnding03|Nyx About Ending 03|Nyx|There can be no escape. Your father wishes that this reputation spread. So that the mortals and the shades never attempt what you were able to achieve.
NyxAboutEnding03|Nyx About Ending 03|Zagreus|Well, it does beat standing around in my chambers aimlessly. And... I daresay it feels rather good not to feel utterly incompetent, for a change.
NyxAboutEnding03|Nyx About Ending 03|Nyx|It is an honor to be working with you, child.
NyxAboutEnding04|Nyx About Ending 04|Zagreus|Nyx, meant to ask... Charon was there to take Mother and me home the one time. So is he... has *he *been working for *you*? All part of some elaborate plan, or something?
NyxAboutEnding04|Nyx About Ending 04|Nyx|Charon serves only this realm, child. And, he is very trustworthy. I suppose that it is also possible he has some affection for the Queen, if not for you.
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Nyx|You are still in a difficult predicament, my child. And I, with you, in turn. Those on Olympus think you seek them, even now. That you are my own son by birth. Our deception, well intentioned as it was, has multiplied in size.
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|You're right. We have to do something. We can't just keep pretending with them.
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Nyx|But if you reveal to them the truth of everything... I fear the wrath they shall unleash. Perhaps not all of them, but some, at least, shall not take such deceptions well.
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|I couldn't agree more. Fortunately, Mother has a plan! Asked me to get in touch with everybody on Olympus, one by one.
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Nyx|Your birthmother is resourceful, certainly. Though can you say as yet, which sort of plan?
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Would you believe it if I told you she wants to have all of them over for Ambrosia?
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest02|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|Nyx, this feast Mother has planned... would it be all right with you if I were to invite Chaos?
NyxAboutOlympianReunionQuest02|Nyx About Olympian Reunion Quest 02|Nyx|I... hardly think that Chaos would attend any festivity of ours. I am uncertain that they even could. Even more doubtful that they would want this. However... if you truly wish to ask, proceed.
NyxPostEpilogue01|Nyx Post Epilogue 01|Nyx|It was a privilege to meet your relatives at last, child. Athena, Ares, and the rest. Confronted face-to-face, they were much more agreeable than I expected. A night we shall remember, was it not?
NyxPostEpilogue01|Nyx Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|A memorable night it was, indeed, Nyx! For most of us, at least. Dionysus, he won't remember any of it, I don't think. But, it was really good to see everyone having a good time. Getting along as though they didn't hold a grudge! So, then, we're clear, I think?
NyxPostEpilogue01|Nyx Post Epilogue 01|Nyx|Persephone told them everything they needed to hear. Sometimes that is the only way, with family. Though, the Olympians... they are prone to their misunderstandings, are they not? This state of kinship may not last eternally.
NyxPostEpilogue01|Nyx Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Well, let's enjoy it while it does, I guess.
NyxPostEpilogue02|Nyx Post Epilogue 02|Nyx|Pride has been the failing of so many mortals, child, and has brought low members of your family, as well. And yet... I am so very proud of you, for what you have achieved. I wanted you to be aware of that.
NyxPostEpilogue02|Nyx Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|That means a lot to me, Nyx. Though I never could have done any of this without your help. Even after I lashed out at you after I learned the truth about Mother, you never stopped caring for me... and you put yourself directly in harm's way, defying Father's will. Why do all that, for me?
NyxPostEpilogue02|Nyx Post Epilogue 02|Nyx|I am eternally committed to this House. Long before your father came to rule, I was already here. When he arrived... I needed to do everything I could to keep order, and establish with Lord Hades an agreeable relationship. But, there is one more reason, besides that...
NyxPostEpilogue02|Nyx Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|To get on better terms with the Olympians. They always used to frown on the Underworld, but... now that they know us, they seem much more willing to get involved and help with things.
NyxPostEpilogue02|Nyx Post Epilogue 02|Nyx|A reasonable guess, and not without some truth to it, but no, my child. My reason for helping you is simpler than that. It is because I love you. You may not be born of me, but I raised you like one of my own. And I have cared for you as I am capable.
NyxPostEpilogue02|Nyx Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|Nyx... I love you, too. Thank you for everything.
NyxPostEpilogue03|Nyx Post Epilogue 03|Nyx|She has departed once again. Your birthmother the Queen. Although, it was not as difficult to see her off, this time. Knowing she shall return.
NyxPostEpilogue03|Nyx Post Epilogue 03|Zagreus|It must be difficult for her... returning to Olympus. She had no love for it at all. I hope she'll be all right.
NyxPostEpilogue03|Nyx Post Epilogue 03|Nyx|Do not despair. We have ways of watching over her. Not that I expect anything untoward to happen, but... well, with your family, one learns to take precautions, as you know.
NyxPostEpilogue03|Nyx Post Epilogue 03|Zagreus|...I'll miss her.
NyxPostEpilogue03|Nyx Post Epilogue 03|Nyx|So shall I. But it shall not be long, I think.
NyxPostEpilogue04|Nyx Post Epilogue 04|Zagreus|I was pleased to see even Chaos was able to attend our little feast there with the Olympians, in spirit, anyway! Were you able to chat at all?
NyxPostEpilogue04|Nyx Post Epilogue 04|Nyx|Only a little bit. The first communication we have had in quite some time. It went better than expected. Perhaps they and I can continue the conversation at some point. Thank you for your initiative, child.
NyxPostEpilogue04|Nyx Post Epilogue 04|Zagreus|Well, let's enjoy it while it does, I guess.
NyxAboutHypnos01|Nyx About Hypnos 01|Nyx|Alas, you have seen much of Hypnos lately, child. I hope you find his disposition somewhat tolerable? Please tell me plain if this is not the case.
NyxAboutHypnos01|Nyx About Hypnos 01|Zagreus|*Oh*, he's not so bad, Nyx. Be proud of your sleepy, cheerful son! Who else among us is able to muster that kind of enthusiasm?
NyxAboutHypnos02|Nyx About Hypnos 02|Zagreus|I don't often see you interact with Hypnos, Nyx, so I just wanted to make sure... is everything all right?
NyxAboutHypnos02|Nyx About Hypnos 02|Nyx|Hypnos still is learning independence, child. Thus, I have decided it is best to keep my distance from him temporarily, else he shall continue to rely upon me, even for completing the most rudimentary requests. We have agreed he shall not call upon me for the time being.
NyxAboutHypnos02|Nyx About Hypnos 02|Zagreus|For the time being? How long are we talking? Can't remember the last time I saw you speaking with him, now that you mention it.
NyxAboutHypnos02|Nyx About Hypnos 02|Nyx|Based on his rate of progress, I suspect his education shall have been complete well before the dawning of the next age.
NyxAboutCharon01|Nyx About Charon 01|Zagreus|Nyx, have you seen Charon lately? Everything all right with him? I can never tell how he's doing.
NyxAboutCharon01|Nyx About Charon 01|Nyx|Charon and I have not lately taken opportunities to correspond. But he has always been among the least dependent of my children, other than perhaps only the Fates. This much I know and can assure to you: He always is content to steer his boat.
NyxAboutCharon01|Nyx About Charon 01|Zagreus|I suppose you are the one to thank for his assistance, when it comes to selling me his wares and such.
NyxAboutCharon01|Nyx About Charon 01|Nyx|No. He is the one to thank. Do not mistake his lack of speech for lack of cleverness. He serves this House as I do. But he does not answer to me.
NyxAboutCharonFight01|Nyx About Charon Fight 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Nyx? You don't suppose Charon would hold it against me if... we had a little fight? To the death, I mean.
NyxAboutCharonFight01|Nyx About Charon Fight 01|Nyx|None of Charon's brothers ever dared fight with him whilst growing up. Why would you fathom such a ruinous idea, child?
NyxAboutCharonFight01|Nyx About Charon Fight 01|Zagreus|It... kind of already happened. And, I can confirm he's rather strong. Something I can do to make it up to him?
NyxAboutCharonFight01|Nyx About Charon Fight 01|Nyx|Probably not. For it is unnecessary. Likely he appreciates having an adversary, in his own way. Few would so much as dare.
NyxMegDefeated01|Nyx Meg Defeated 01|Nyx|You must have vanquished Megaera, my child, for she has been sulking in the lounge for quite some time. You are safe here from her whip, but not her words.
NyxMegDefeated01|Nyx Meg Defeated 01|Zagreus|I'd better talk to her. Thank you for the heads-up, Nyx. See you later, I'm sure.
NyxMegDefeated01_Alt|Nyx Meg Defeated 01 Alt|Nyx|You must have vanquished Megaera, my child. For she has been sulking in the corner there for quite some time. You are safe here from her whip, but not her words.
NyxMegDefeated01_Alt|Nyx Meg Defeated 01 Alt|Zagreus|I'd better talk to her. Thank you for the heads-up, Nyx. See you later, I'm sure.
NyxAboutChaos01|Nyx About Chaos 01|Zagreus|Nyx, do you know anything about a softly-spoken gentlebeing under the guise of Chaos? They approached me recently, and offered me a Boon, of sorts.
NyxAboutChaos01|Nyx About Chaos 01|Nyx|Primordial Chaos... indeed, I know them well. They must have taken interest in your quest. I would advise that you beware their offerings, though know that Chaos, whilst a trickster, is not a deceiver.
NyxAboutChaos02|Nyx About Chaos 02|Zagreus|Can you tell me something more of Chaos, Nyx? I... have a lot of questions.
NyxAboutChaos02|Nyx About Chaos 02|Nyx|My place is not to speak too openly of Chaos, child. It is their own prerogative to tell you of themselves. I can say they are the eldest force within this world. Before them, there was nothing.
NyxAboutChaos03|Nyx About Chaos 03|Zagreus|Chaos seems to have taken somewhat of a liking to me, Nyx. They mentioned you.
NyxAboutChaos03|Nyx About Chaos 03|Nyx|They mentioned me, did they... I thought, perhaps, that they had long forgotten. You should know they are my mother and my father, child. We have not spoken since the dawn of time.
NyxAboutChaos04|Nyx About Chaos 04|Zagreus|Nyx, I hate to be a bother, but I wanted to ask you about Chaos once again. Won't you at least try to reach out to them?
NyxAboutChaos04|Nyx About Chaos 04|Nyx|It is for Chaos to reach out to me if they wish to reacquaint themselves with me. Child, it would please me if we spoke no more of this for now.
NyxAboutChaos05|Nyx About Chaos 05|Nyx|Child, I... know not exactly what you did, but... I detected faintly an attempt by Chaos to reach out to me. A message, merely at the edges of my consciousness, yet I felt certain it was there. But I could not discern it, otherwise. What does Chaos want from me?
NyxAboutChaos05|Nyx About Chaos 05|Zagreus|I... think Chaos wishes to reestablish contact with you, Nyx. The two of you drifted apart from one another, so, I think I can imagine. I lost touch with Thanatos awhile! But that was nothing in comparison to this. Isn't there someway you can reconnect?
NyxAboutChaos05|Nyx About Chaos 05|Nyx|Now that the House is strong, and this realm orderly, I do not know. But I shall think upon it, child. Leave me, please.
NyxAboutChaos06|Nyx About Chaos 06|Nyx|I know what must be done, regarding Chaos and myself, my child. It is not often that I ask for your assistance, but I need for you to do something for me, if you would hear me out.
NyxAboutChaos06|Nyx About Chaos 06|Zagreus|Of course, Nyx. Anything. What can I do?
NyxAboutChaos06|Nyx About Chaos 06|Nyx|In the administrative chamber, you perhaps recall the Eldest Sigil there. Through it we have access directly to the darkest reaches of the realm. But not to Chaos, anymore. Not currently. Though, this is solvable, I think.
NyxAboutChaos06|Nyx About Chaos 06|Zagreus|Wait, the Sigil? But I'm not authorized to use it. It's never worked for me, and I have even less authority around here now.
NyxAboutChaos06|Nyx About Chaos 06|Nyx|That you were stripped of your authority is what makes this possible at all. It shall require a significant expenditure of Darkness. Then... the bridge to Chaos may be restored. So that I might travel again to visit them. Will you bring Darkness to the Sigil for me, please? When possible.
NyxAboutChaos06|Nyx About Chaos 06|Zagreus|I'll do everything I can. Hey maybe you can put in a request with the House Contractor for me? Make it official, right?
NyxAboutChaos07|Nyx About Chaos 07|Nyx|At last. The bridge to Chaos is restored. Thank you so very much, my child. I shall be going, then. And I shall presently return. Please, have no fear. And now, farewell. I shall bring Chaos your kindest regards.
NyxChaosReunionQuestComplete|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|Nyx, you're back! So, how did things with Chaos go? Please tell me it went well?
NyxChaosReunionQuestComplete|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete|Nyx|It did. It did go well, my child, I... appreciated having had a chance to reconnect with my great ancestor. Thanks to your generosity, to both of us. We had to make up for a great deal of lost time.
NyxChaosReunionQuestComplete|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|So what happens now? You're back on speaking terms, then... does it mean Chaos will stop by for a visit soon, something like that?
NyxChaosReunionQuestComplete|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete|Nyx|Chaos is comfortable in their realm. I may, however, visit every now and then. Keep them apprised of what unfolds up here. Beyond that... Chaos knows better than to exert too much influence upon this realm. Beyond having already formulated it, and everything.
NyxChaosReunionQuestCompleteAftermath01|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete Aftermath 01|Zagreus|How are you and Chaos getting on, lately, Nyx? Sounds like they expected an awful lot from you before. That you should shine as bright as day, something like that? I can't imagine.
NyxChaosReunionQuestCompleteAftermath01|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete Aftermath 01|Nyx|To shine was never quite my strongest suit. During the dawn of creation, there was much to do. This place... all that you see around you... it was more my leaning. Chaos understands that better, now. As for me, the work helped me to know which limits I have.
NyxChaosReunionQuestCompleteAftermath01|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete Aftermath 01|Zagreus|What limits are those? You seem capable of anything. Probably even shining bright.
NyxChaosReunionQuestCompleteAftermath01|Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest Complete Aftermath 01|Nyx|Come, child. We each have our limits.
NyxAboutMeg01|Nyx About Meg 01|Nyx|The Fury Megaera is under orders to prevent your passage out of Tartarus, my child. Conflict between the two of you is unavoidable. It brings me pain to have to see you fight.
NyxAboutMeg01|Nyx About Meg 01|Zagreus|Don't say that, Nyx. Besides! Conflict between Megaera and me has always put the spark in our relationship. We're going to be fine.
NyxAboutMeg02|Nyx About Meg 02|Zagreus|Nyx, you've known Megaera practically forever. Well, before my time at least, so could you... tell me more about what she was like, back then?
NyxAboutMeg02|Nyx About Meg 02|Nyx|*Ah-hahah*. I am pleased to see the two of you on better terms of late. Megaera always was as she appears. Dutiful and quite particular. Thoughtful and dependable. Respectful.
NyxAboutMegRelationship01|Nyx About Meg Relationship 01|Nyx|It pleases me that you and Megaera have come to deeply understand each other, child. I must admit to you, it was my hope that you and she were capable of this result.
NyxAboutMegRelationship01|Nyx About Meg Relationship 01|Zagreus|You're pleased we're together, Nyx? I thought you'd be concerned that such relationships distract from work responsibilities and such. Although, I'm grateful to have your approval.
NyxAboutMegRelationship01|Nyx About Meg Relationship 01|Nyx|I have no fear that Megaera shall be distracted, child. Besides; such matters are more likely to inspire, and to spur greater accomplishment. Although, the greater sense of contentment tends to be a sufficient end unto itself.
NyxAboutMegRelationship01B|Nyx About Meg Relationship 01 B|Nyx|It pleases me that you and Megaera have come to deeply understand each other, child. I must admit to you, it was my hope that you and she were capable of this result.
NyxAboutMegRelationship01B|Nyx About Meg Relationship 01 B|Zagreus|You're happy Meg and I are friends now, Nyx? I appreciate it, certainly, though... I worry it might get in the way of Meg's ability to do her job.
NyxAboutMegRelationship01B|Nyx About Meg Relationship 01 B|Nyx|I have no such fear for either one of you. You both are dedicated to your tasks. I trust your friendship can withstand your confrontations every now and then. For that is why the friendship blossomed, is it not?
NyxAboutThanatos01|Nyx About Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Nyx... I ran into Thanatos out there. He aided me, although I think he's rather upset. That I took off like this.
NyxAboutThanatos01|Nyx About Thanatos 01|Nyx|Thanatos is worried for you, child. I hope you understand whatever anger you may sense from him is not the feeling at the source. Please forgive his rudeness.
NyxAboutThanatos02|Nyx About Thanatos 02|Nyx|Thanatos has finally come home. Have you not seen him, child? He has been very much preoccupied of late. It must have gladdened him to see you once again.
NyxAboutThanatosRelationship01|Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01|Nyx|You and my son... it pleases me to see the two of you have grown so close of late. Thanatos has always led a solitary life. He never would complain of it, and yet... I know he yearned for closeness, in his way.
NyxAboutThanatosRelationship01|Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|Thank you, Nyx. I think we each have harbored feelings for each other for some time. We've finally been true about them.
NyxAboutThanatosRelationship01|Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01|Nyx|Then, in this you each achieved what you desired. I ask that you take care of my dear son. I often fear that he shall work himself too hard.
NyxAboutThanatosRelationship01|Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|*Oh*, he's all right. Though, I'll be sure to keep an eye on him.
NyxAboutThanatosRelationship01B|Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01 B|Nyx|You and my son... it pleases me to see the two of you have grown so close of late. Thanatos has always led a solitary life. He never would complain of it, and yet... I know he yearned for closeness, in his way.
NyxAboutThanatosRelationship01B|Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01 B|Zagreus|It's difficult to find a friend down here. Though, I have always had a trusted one in Thanatos, and he in me. I think we have a better understanding of that now.
NyxAboutThanatosRelationship01B|Nyx About Thanatos Relationship 01 B|Nyx|Then, may the bonds of your friendship last for as long as this House shall reign beneath the earth, here in the dark. Take care of my dear son.
NyxAboutDusa01|Nyx About Dusa 01|Nyx|What is it, child? I sense that your concern is of a different nature than it usually is. Yet, it is veiled to me, somehow.
NyxAboutDusa01|Nyx About Dusa 01|Zagreus|Oh, it's just.... Please don't take this the wrong way, Nyx, but I was worried you were being rather harsh to Dusa. You asked her not to speak to me, at all?
NyxAboutDusa01|Nyx About Dusa 01|Nyx|I asked she mind her own responsibilities. I fear she forgets herself, in this House. Though you have an informal air... you are the Prince! The only son of the Lord Hades, Fate-appointed master of this realm. You shall have the company of gods. Not severed gorgon heads.
NyxAboutDusa01|Nyx About Dusa 01|Zagreus|*Pff*! If I'm so important, shouldn't *I *be the one to choose whom I get to interact with around here?
NyxAboutDusa01|Nyx About Dusa 01|Nyx|You do not fully know your place, my child. The gorgon-head most certainly does not know hers. Please focus on your task at hand, and leave her be.
NyxAboutDusa02|Nyx About Dusa 02|Nyx|You are consorting with the severed gorgon head, my child. Despite my wishes that you maintain respectful distances between yourselves.
NyxAboutDusa02|Nyx About Dusa 02|Zagreus|She's my friend, Nyx. Look... I love you very much, you know I do, except... you cannot choose my friends for me! I can't allow that. I know you don't trust her. Don't you trust me?
NyxAboutDusa02|Nyx About Dusa 02|Nyx|...I do. Then, very well. But understand that your relationship with her does not preclude the need for her continual improvement with respect to her responsibilities.
NyxAboutDusa03|Nyx About Dusa 03|Zagreus|What happened with Dusa, Nyx? You really fired her because she talked to me? She was my friend!
NyxAboutDusa03|Nyx About Dusa 03|Nyx|She was removed for insubordination, and repeated overextension and lack of proper judgment, child. Your affinity for her is the reason her removal was as amicable as it was.
NyxAboutDusa03|Nyx About Dusa 03|Zagreus|Insubordination, and repeated lack of what? She worked harder than anyone here to keep the House neat and orderly! I'd thought you would have valued that!
NyxAboutDusa03|Nyx About Dusa 03|Nyx|Her eagerness to please was to a fault. Perhaps your Olympian relatives require sacrifices, child, but this House requires efficiency, and nothing more.
NyxAboutDusa03|Nyx About Dusa 03|Zagreus|*Efficiency*... you know who you sound like right now, don't you, Nyx? I can't believe this.
NyxAboutDusa03|Nyx About Dusa 03|Nyx|If you are bent on undermining my authority, go do so someplace else.
NyxAboutDusa04|Nyx About Dusa 04|Zagreus|Nyx... I'm sorry that I raised my voice with you before, it's just... I cared about Dusa, and I know just how much she cared about working here, with you, and all of us... isn't there some way you would reconsider letting her go?
NyxAboutDusa04|Nyx About Dusa 04|Nyx|I appreciate that you have calmed yourself, my child. As for the gorgon head, this House needs steady-tempered vigilance, not unthinking devotion. Despite repeated feedback, she refused to approach any aspect of her duties with restraint.
NyxAboutDusa04|Nyx About Dusa 04|Zagreus|Wait, you're saying you fired Dusa for *working too hard*? Did you give her any warning?
NyxAboutDusa04|Nyx About Dusa 04|Nyx|She did not understand how to work properly. Despite all that she did, she ultimately was a burden to this House. There was no warning necessary on my part.
NyxAboutDusa04|Nyx About Dusa 04|Zagreus|Please give her another chance, Nyx. She can learn, she just needs to know what she did wrong. She gave this work everything. She just pushed too hard. Shouldn't something like that be forgivable?
NyxAboutDusa04|Nyx About Dusa 04|Nyx|...It seems you have more patience than I, child. And, I did not realize you cared. But do not ask again for me to rescind my decision. Are we understood?
NyxAboutDusa05|Nyx About Dusa 05|Zagreus|You really asked Dusa to come back. Thank you, Nyx! I'm very grateful. And Megaera. Probably everybody here! I'm sure she won't let you down.
NyxAboutDusa05|Nyx About Dusa 05|Nyx|I know you care for her, child. And I admit I retain several concerns. Not only about the appropriateness of her conduct, but of her reckless inexperience. I do, however, see the possibility that she can work through these issues. Perhaps with your support.
NyxAboutDusaRelationship01|Nyx About Dusa Relationship 01|Nyx|At first, I was deeply concerned that you were spending so much time with Dusa, child. It seemed unbecoming for the both of you, and threatened to disrupt our custodian's routine. Except... it pleases me to say that, in this case, I was mistaken about you.
NyxAboutDusaRelationship01|Nyx About Dusa Relationship 01|Zagreus|Thank you for saying so, Nyx. Though, you mean you were mistaken about me, or about Dusa?
NyxAboutDusaRelationship01|Nyx About Dusa Relationship 01|Nyx|I was mistaken about both of you. That you would influence her in a harmful way, yet here, in point of fact, she has performed her duties with increasing skill. That she would fail to perform her role, or to learn well from her mistakes. Please do continue to look out for her.
NyxRevealsArthurAspect01|Nyx Reveals Arthur Aspect 01|Nyx|Hold, child. I have a message for you from my daughters, themselves. Concerning the Blade of the Underworld in your possession.
NyxRevealsArthurAspect01|Nyx Reveals Arthur Aspect 01|Zagreus|Wait, you mean the Fates? And Stygius? I'm honored that they would have taken any notice of me. What is it that they want for me to know?
NyxRevealsArthurAspect01|Nyx Reveals Arthur Aspect 01|Nyx|They wish for me to impart to you these words, so that your blade, in turn, may hear them uttered from your lips: *I see your kingly pardon from a prison of stone. *Repeat them, and remember.
NyxRevealsArthurAspect01|Nyx Reveals Arthur Aspect 01|Zagreus|*I see your kingly pardon from a prison of stone*... this must be for one of the weapon's hidden forms. Please tell your daughters I am very grateful, Nyx.
NyxRevealsArthurAspect01|Nyx Reveals Arthur Aspect 01|Nyx|I shall, child. Although, I'm certain they already know. Though, whether they are aiding you or this is simply what must come to pass, I cannot say.
NyxRevealsArthurAspect02|Nyx Reveals Arthur Aspect 02|Zagreus|Nyx, the words you told me... when I spoke them to Stygius, the blade revealed to me the form of a great leader among men, taking counsel with his loyal retinue about a circular table. But if his reign is inevitable, why would the Fates need me?
NyxRevealsArthurAspect02|Nyx Reveals Arthur Aspect 02|Nyx|That I cannot say, child. It is peculiar having daughters who know every outcome that shall come to pass. It puts a strain on our relationship, and... I have learned never to ask they tell me more than they are willing to impart.
NyxFlashback01|Nyx Flashback 01|Zagreus|You... you're... Nyx, you're not my mother. All this time, you and my father, you... you lied to me?
NyxFlashback01|Nyx Flashback 01|Nyx|*Oh*, my dear child! So now you know...? So now you know. But, only half the truth. I can explain the rest, so, please.... It never was my wish to hurt you.
NyxAboutLegendary01|Nyx About Legendary 01|Zagreus|Hey Nyx, I would have you know, I'm now proud owner of my very own Chthonic Companion! You really built them to last. Just... not very many of them, apparently. I'd all but given up on ever finding one.
NyxAboutLegendary01|Nyx About Legendary 01|Nyx|I sensed this outcome, and it pleases me. Though, you never would have simply discovered such a thing. They each are unique artifacts that must be given willingly if they are to retain their shape, and power.
NyxAboutLegendary01|Nyx About Legendary 01|Zagreus|I have to say, and I do mean this as a compliment: It's hard for me to imagine Night Incarnate herself fashioning these little keepsakes to be given between friends.
NyxAboutLegendary01|Nyx About Legendary 01|Nyx|Do not mistake them for their unassuming look. Within them is the strength of an unbreaking bond between two souls conjoined.
NyxAboutLegendary02|Nyx About Legendary 02|Zagreus|Nyx, did you really give Dusa quite possibly the sole surviving epsilon edition Chthonic Companion in the entire Underworld? She's very grateful for it, so much so that she entrusted Fidi to my care. They grow in power that way, right?
NyxAboutLegendary02|Nyx About Legendary 02|Nyx|The severed gorgon head is not without redeeming attributes, my child. Though, I expected this companion would soon find its way to you, the way the two of you have grown attached. Thus, in one action, both of you have found encouragement.
NyxWithHades01|Duo - Nyx and Hades (1)|Hades|...You are not to aid him in these matters, Nyx; his foolishness is to be scorned and reprimanded, not indulged. Do we have an understanding?
NyxWithHades01|Duo - Nyx and Hades (1)|Nyx|We have an understanding, Hades, yes. He is your own son, after all, and therefore your responsibility. I, in turn, have my commitments to this realm, and to this House. You have aided me in them, so I remain, as ever, in your debt.
NyxWithHades01|Duo - Nyx and Hades (1)|Hades|It is not necessary to remind me. Surely all those who once defied my brothers and myself would much prefer a post within my House over eternity within the lowest depths of Tartarus. Not that the darkness there would trouble you.
NyxWithHades02|Duo - Nyx and Hades (2)|Hades|...It is plain to me that you are helping him; in spite of my insistence you do not. What do you expect that I should do about this, Nyx? What would you do, in my position? Deception, in my very house and home...! Answer me.
NyxWithHades02|Duo - Nyx and Hades (2)|Nyx|Hades, my relationship with him remains unchanged. It is the very same relationship from when you first requested I take care of him. He has my full support, and always shall. You must know this. He wishes now to leave. I shall make no attempt to stop him.
NyxWithHades02|Duo - Nyx and Hades (2)|Hades|*Tsch*. What good is any one of you? He's not even your son; and yet you coddle him. You know as well as I that he cannot succeed. You fill his mind with harmful delusions. If that is what you want for him, then, please! Proceed at pace.
NyxWithHades03|Duo - Nyx and Hades (3)|Hades|*Olympus knows of him*?! Bestowing on him all their worthless blessings, here, within my realm! *Our *realm! Explain to me how, exactly, this is possible, Nyx. Either your limitless power has considerably waned, or you are up to something.
NyxWithHades03|Duo - Nyx and Hades (3)|Nyx|Do not question my power, Hades. Your son was bound to be discovered the closer he came to the surface. The Olympians are pleased to know they have a distant relative, and bid him welcome to their mountain. That is all. Their influence is very limited.
NyxWithHades03|Duo - Nyx and Hades (3)|Hades|Blood and darkness! Do not speak to me about their *influence*! I've seen their influence firsthand. You've made a foolish mistake.
NyxWithHades03|Duo - Nyx and Hades (3)|Nyx|You would speak to me of foolish mistakes? You cannot change the course that has been set. Try all you like.
NyxWithHades04|Duo - Nyx and Hades (4)|Hades|What now, Nyx? Do you realize the danger you have put her in? You claim to care for her, but now you threaten to expose her, to *them*!
NyxWithHades04|Duo - Nyx and Hades (4)|Nyx|Hades. When have I even once been unaware of precisely what I mean to do? I shall bring no harm to the Queen, and neither shall your son.
NyxWithHades04|Duo - Nyx and Hades (4)|Zagreus|Harm to the Queen, wait... what are you talking about?
NyxWithHades04|Duo - Nyx and Hades (4)|Nyx|Child! Zagreus. Do you intend to betray the presence of your birthmother to the Olympians?
NyxWithHades04|Duo - Nyx and Hades (4)|Zagreus|No! Of course not. She... seems content to be all on her own.
NyxWithHades04|Duo - Nyx and Hades (4)|Hades|You take his word for it? How can you trust him not to ruin everything?
NyxWithHades04|Duo - Nyx and Hades (4)|Nyx|Precisely how I trusted him to get us to this point.
NyxWithHades05|Duo - Nyx and Hades (5)|Hades|...What I attempt to tell you, Nyx, is I am grateful. For our long-standing collaboration, here. My rule was thrust upon you and your kin. By all rights, you ought have undermined my every move. I often thought you would. Yet once Olympus and I severed ties... you stood by me still.
NyxWithHades05|Duo - Nyx and Hades (5)|Nyx|I am the Night Itself, as you well know, Hades. As I declared to you when first we met: I shall stand by your side, so long as you remain the fate-appointed ruler of this realm.
NyxWithHades05|Duo - Nyx and Hades (5)|Hades|I shall require no additional reminders. Know, in turn, that I shall always oversee this realm to the full extent of my ability.
NyxWithAchilles01|Duo - Nyx and Achilles (1)|Achilles|...I've done the best I could, preparing him. Though, I am fearful it was not enough. No one ever has escaped this place.
NyxWithAchilles01|Duo - Nyx and Achilles (1)|Nyx|Your expertise has readied him, Achilles. Yet I sense it is your confidence in him which spurs him on. Do not lose faith in yourself now, lest soon he do the same.
NyxWithAchilles02|Duo - Nyx and Achilles (2)|Achilles|...You raised him well, O Night. You know that, I hope? Though, I can't imagine even you could have expected this outcome. Thank you... for making all this possible. For all of us.
NyxWithAchilles02|Duo - Nyx and Achilles (2)|Nyx|You are to thank for this outcome as much as I. Perhaps more so. For I have little choice but to serve this House. I was created in this realm, and it is everything to me. But you? Your loyalty could not have been assumed.
NyxWithAchilles02|Duo - Nyx and Achilles (2)|Achilles|*Oh*, I don't know. I felt I had no choice, either, except to serve this House. At least at first. But in training the Prince... preparing him... I felt like I was living for something again. As strange as that may sound.
NyxWithAchilles02|Duo - Nyx and Achilles (2)|Nyx|Nevertheless, given the circumstances of your life and servitude, you need not have given so much of yourself. The greatness of your mortal days followed you into death.
NyxWithAchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Nyx and Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Achilles|...I cannot ever repay you for what you have done, O Night. Know only that it is my honor to continue to serve at your pleasure, here.
NyxWithAchillesAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Duo - Nyx and Achilles After Myrmidon Reunion Quest (1)|Nyx|I am certain I know nothing of what you mean, Achilles. Though, your continued service here is more than welcome. The honor is mine.
NyxWithPersephone01|Duo - Nyx and Persephone (1)|Nyx|...Persephone, my Queen... it has been far too long. Although, the passing of the time was very kind. It is an honor to see you again.
NyxWithPersephone01|Duo - Nyx and Persephone (1)|Persephone|Oh, please, Nyx! No formalities between us, right? It's wonderful to see you, too, my friend. The days there on the surface, they were very different, but the nights... I was reminded of our times together, here.
NyxWithPersephone01|Duo - Nyx and Persephone (1)|Nyx|Good times, I trust.
NyxWithPersephone01|Duo - Nyx and Persephone (1)|Persephone|Good times, most certainly! I try not to remember the others!
NyxWithPersephone01|Duo - Nyx and Persephone (1)|Nyx|We are pleased to have you back. Although, it shall be a difficult adjustment for you once again, I fear. For all of us.
NyxWithPersephone01|Duo - Nyx and Persephone (1)|Persephone|Well, having built a little house all by myself up there, I think I'm up for anything! You know what it's like.
NyxChat01|Nyx Chat 01|Nyx|Darkness guide you, child.
NyxChat02|Nyx Chat 02|Nyx|I am preoccupied, so please excuse me, child.
NyxChat03|Nyx Chat 03|Nyx|Take care of yourself, child.
NyxChat04|Nyx Chat 04|Nyx|I shall be watching over you, and our House alike.
NyxChat05|Nyx Chat 05|Nyx|Do not concern yourself about your father. I shall be watching him.
NyxChat06|Nyx Chat 06|Nyx|Fear not for Cerberus. He is well taken care of in your absence, and well-fed.
NyxChat07|Nyx Chat 07|Nyx|Go, fulfill your purpose, child.
NyxChat08|Nyx Chat 08|Nyx|Your fate lies somewhere past these walls, child.
NyxChat09|Nyx Chat 09|Nyx|You are always welcome in my company, child.
NyxChat10|Nyx Chat 10|Nyx|Do not despair, and hold to your resolve, child.
NyxChat11|Nyx Chat 11|Nyx|Remember there are those who love you, child.
NyxChat12|Nyx Chat 12|Nyx|Do not let circumstances rattle your resolve, child.
NyxChat13|Nyx Chat 13|Nyx|Thank you for visiting me, child.
NyxChat14|Nyx Chat 14|Nyx|Such brief exchanges gladden me, my child.
NyxChat15|Nyx Chat 15|Nyx|Your father is the same as ever, child.
NyxChat16|Nyx Chat 16|Nyx|Someday, you shall achieve your heart's desire, child.
NyxChat17|Nyx Chat 17|Nyx|The life the Fates apportioned to you lies ahead, my child.
NyxChat18|Nyx Chat 18|Nyx|May you discover what you seek, my child.
NyxChat19|Nyx Chat 19|Nyx|I shall keep you safe during your stay here, child.
NyxChat20|Nyx Chat 20|Nyx|I am well, though thank you for your remembering me, child.
NyxChat21|Nyx Chat 21|Nyx|I am filled with joy to see you whole, my child.
NyxChat22|Nyx Chat 22|Nyx|Always am I grateful for your company, my child.
NyxChat23|Nyx Chat 23|Nyx|You are most generous to visit with me, child.
NyxChat24|Nyx Chat 24|Nyx|You look rather well on this occasion, child.
NyxChat25|Nyx Chat 25|Nyx|It pleases me having these brief exchanges, child.
NyxChat26|Nyx Chat 26|Nyx|My faith in you has never faltered, child.
NyxChat27|Nyx Chat 27|Nyx|I sense your worry for me, child, yet would seek to disabuse you of the sentiment.
NyxChat28|Nyx Chat 28|Nyx|Though your journeys take you elsewhere, still it pleases me to see you, child.
NyxChat29|Nyx Chat 29|Nyx|My focus is on other matters at this time.
NyxChat30|Nyx Chat 30|Nyx|Please leave me to my current task at hand.
NyxChat31|Nyx Chat 31|Nyx|Let us communicate again some other time.
NyxChat32|Nyx Chat 32|Nyx|I shall support you however I can, my child.
NyxChat33|Nyx Chat 33|Nyx|Through any setback, you are always welcome here with me, dear child.
NyxChat34|Nyx Chat 34|Nyx|The nature of this realm, my child, is not fully known or understood, not by anyone within it or above.
NyxChat35|Nyx Chat 35|Nyx|There is no setback which you cannot overcome.
NyxChat36|Nyx Chat 36|Nyx|All here is well at present, child.
NyxChat37|Nyx Chat 37|Nyx|The House stands strong from all your labors, child.
NyxChat38|Nyx Chat 38|Nyx|You bring me pride through your accomplishments.
NyxChat39|Nyx Chat 39|Nyx|Go, and serve this House.
NyxChat40|Nyx Chat 40|Nyx|May Thanatos assist you should you cross his path.
NyxChat41|Nyx Chat 41|Nyx|Remain unseen, my child.
NyxChat42|Nyx Chat 42|Nyx|The Queen Persephone must be so proud of you.
NyxChat43|Nyx Chat 43|Nyx|Go, in honor of your birthmother, the Queen.
NyxChat44|Nyx Chat 44|Nyx|This House is stronger with the Queen returned.
NyxChat45|Nyx Chat 45|Nyx|Honor the Queen, my child.
NyxChat46|Nyx Chat 46|Nyx|Your father's spirits have been better as of late.
NyxChat47|Nyx Chat 47|Nyx|Your birthmother awaits. Go find her, child.
NyxChat48|Nyx Chat 48|Nyx|Seek out your birthmother again, my child.
NyxChat49|Nyx Chat 49|Nyx|Persephone awaits above.
NyxChat50|Nyx Chat 50|Nyx|I know for certain your birthmother waits for you.
NyxChat51|Nyx Chat 51|Nyx|Go. You know precisely where to find her now.
NyxChat53|Nyx Chat 53|Nyx|I am afraid I cannot help you now.
NyxChat54|Nyx Chat 54|Nyx|You shall discover what you seek when it is time.
NyxGift01|Nyx Gift 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Nyx? You've done so much for me, I.. thought you might like this.
NyxGift01|Nyx Gift 01|Nyx|You know your father does not like it when Nectar is doled out on the premises, dear child. However, I am not he... and I wished, regardless, to provide to you a token of my affection.
NyxGift02|Nyx Gift 02|Nyx|How can I possibly accept such generosity, my child? Surely others whom you know are more deserving of such offerings.
NyxGift02|Nyx Gift 02|Zagreus|Nonsense, Nyx. I want you to have it. You've always cared for me. I can't ever repay you for that.
NyxGift03|Nyx Gift 03|Nyx|Your kindness toward me is unnecessary, child. You know I have no expectation of such gifts, from you or anyone.
NyxGift03|Nyx Gift 03|Zagreus|I think of you always, Nyx. You raised me as your own, and I am grateful for it.
NyxGift04|Nyx Gift 04|Nyx|You honor me, my child; although I dread that I am not deserving of such generosity. There is no need to flatter me like this.
NyxGift04|Nyx Gift 04|Zagreus|Be that as it may, Nyx! I would still like for you to have it, with my compliments.
NyxGift05|Nyx Gift 05|Nyx|No gift which you could bring me can exceed the value of our kinship, child. Though, it moves me to receive this offering.
NyxGift05|Nyx Gift 05|Zagreus|It's nothing, Nyx, really. I know you've always believed in me, and it's not something I ever take for granted.
NyxGift06|Nyx Gift 06|Nyx|Among my many children, both those born to me and surrogate to me, you are one of the most thoughtful and most generous of all.
NyxGift06|Nyx Gift 06|Zagreus|You have always cared for me and protected me. And given me someone to look up to. This is nothing, Nyx.
NyxGift07|Nyx Gift 07|Zagreus|Nyx, if you'll forgive me this transgression for a moment, I would like for you to have this vintage bottle of Ambrosia, please. You can hand it off to Megaera as contraband, but... just in case, I wanted you to have it, first.
NyxGift07|Nyx Gift 07|Nyx|*Ah*. A crystal bottle come all the way from the highest peaks of Mount Olympus to these depths within the earth. Your father always said he hated it.
NyxGift07|Nyx Gift 07|Zagreus|Though, Father does have questionable taste.
NyxGift07|Nyx Gift 07|Nyx|*Ah, hahahaha*. I accept this gift, with gratitude. This is a delicacy I have not experienced myself. Perhaps I may yet save it for appropriate occasions still to come. Thank you, my child.
NyxGift08|Nyx Gift 08|Nyx|By the way, I meant to tell you, child. The Ambrosia that you gave me? Rather than hold onto it indefinitely, I decided recently to sample it. Your father's claims about its flavor are quite false. I have never tasted anything like it.
NyxGift08|Nyx Gift 08|Zagreus|So glad you liked it, Nyx! And, good timing, too, because... I have for you another bottle, here. They say each one is different in its own respect! And besides, the pleasures of Olympus should be shared. Please, take it, won't you?
NyxGift08|Nyx Gift 08|Nyx|You are persuasive like your mother, and determined like your father, child. But if you so insist, then I shall not deny myself the simple pleasures of this drink. Though rare is the occasion for it here.
NyxGift09|Nyx Gift 09|Zagreus|Nyx, along with giving you this bottle of Ambrosia here, there's something I have meant to say to you. The Three Fates have been very kind to me. Because, in denying me my birthmother... they gave me you. Without your steady presence here, I... can't imagine what it would be like.
NyxGift09|Nyx Gift 09|Nyx|*Oh*. Then, the Three Fates are whimsical, indeed. When you were born, and I was filled with fear for what it meant for you to be alive, to be responsible for you... I must admit I did not guess that, one evening, you would provide for me both such a gift, and such a sentiment.
NyxGift09|Nyx Gift 09|Zagreus|Well, I mean every word. I love you, Nyx.
NyxInChaos01|Nyx In Chaos 01|Nyx|My greetings to you, child. How unusual that we should come in contact here. Chaos and I had quite a bit of catching up to do. Please go about your business, and I shall see you back inside the House in time. Provided you return there, of course. And, thank you for this, once again.
NyxInChaos02|Nyx In Chaos 02|Nyx|Chaos and I have much catching up to do.
NyxInChaos03|Nyx In Chaos 03|Nyx|How interesting to see you here, my child.
NyxInChaos04|Nyx In Chaos 04|Nyx|Please go ahead and do not mind me, child.
NyxInChaos05|Nyx In Chaos 05|Nyx|Thank you for keeping Chaos company.
NyxInChaos06|Nyx In Chaos 06|Nyx|Go forth, bearing the mark of Chaos.
NyxInChaos07|Nyx In Chaos 07|Nyx|Chaos and I have so much left to discuss.
NyxInChaos08|Nyx In Chaos 08|Nyx|It is comforting to be here again, in such darkness.
NyxInChaos09|Nyx In Chaos 09|Nyx|I shall see you back at the House soon, child.
NyxInChaos10|Nyx In Chaos 10|Nyx|It is odd to have returned to where I was born.
NyxInChaos11|Nyx In Chaos 11|Nyx|We are pleased to see you here, however briefly.
NyxInChaos12|Nyx In Chaos 12|Nyx|As Chaos cannot visit us as easily, now I can visit them.
HypnosFirstMeeting|Hypnos First Meeting|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, where... wait, I know *you*! Guess that means you died out there, huh? Well don't be sad, though, pretty much everybody dies sometime!
HypnosMiscMeeting01|Hypnos Misc Meeting 01|Hypnos|Oh! Hi. I'd ask you how it went, but since you're here again, I guess I know already, huh! Oh well, just come on in!
HypnosMiscMeeting02|Hypnos Misc Meeting 02|Hypnos|Ah, good, you're back already, huh? A few of us, we had a bet, about how long you'd last out there, and I just *knew *you'd be back in *no time*!
HypnosMiscMeeting03|Hypnos Misc Meeting 03|Hypnos|Oh, hi! *Um*, welcome home! Again! Go right ahead! I think your dad's mad about something or other, though.
HypnosMiscMeeting04|Hypnos Misc Meeting 04|Hypnos|Wow, you've died at least *five times *so far, I think? Dying's good for the whole ecosystem down here, so, uh, thanks! You're helping make the Underworld a better place!
HypnosMiscMeeting04|Hypnos Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|Great! Just keep dying over and over and everything will be fine.
HypnosMiscMeeting05|Hypnos Misc Meeting 05|Hypnos|It's fun watching the Pool of Styx, you know? The ripples in the blood, and everything, and sometimes, somebody pops out of there, like you! House staff and guests of honor, no one else. I sign them in, and help make sure they have a pleasant stay!
HypnosMiscMeeting06|Hypnos Misc Meeting 06|Hypnos|*Ooh*, why you made it all the way to Asphodel that time, that's pretty neat! Still died and everything but not as quickly as you used to, so, that's progress, right?
HypnosRunProgress01_A|Hypnos Run Progress 01 A|Hypnos|Hey, wow, you did it! According to my list it says here you've died, what, fifty times *at least*! That's more than anybody's died around here, I think!
HypnosRunProgress01|Hypnos Run Progress 01|Hypnos|Hey, let me be the first to say: *Congratulations*! You have died a hundred times since I've been keeping score. Since I've been keeping track. No prize for it or anything, but the journey is its own reward, or something, right?
HypnosRunProgress02|Hypnos Run Progress 02|Hypnos|You're not going to believe this, here, you ready? Three.. hundred... *times*!! That's right! Three hundred times, you've died! That's like... more than an entire village from an earthquake, all on your own!
HypnosRunProgress03|Hypnos Run Progress 03|Hypnos|Oh, I just can't believe it, although I know my list here never lies! And it says that you have died all of five *hundred *times! *Five hundred*!! I can't even think of a number higher than that!
HypnosMegDefeated01|Hypnos Meg Defeated 01|Hypnos|It's usually pretty quiet, keeping watch over the Pool of Styx back there. But it's sure been busy lately! Why, somebody else came through just earlier! You should have seen the look on my face when it wasn't you!
HypnosAboutThanatos01|Hypnos About Thanatos 01|Hypnos|Hey, you keep dying! You happen to run into my brother anywhere out there, by any chance? Haven't seen him in ages, what's with the long assignment?
HypnosAboutThanatos01|Hypnos About Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Something about a war. Father sent Thanatos to take stock, but you're right, it's been a while now that you mention it. I guess a lot's occurred down here since then.
HypnosAboutThanatos01|Hypnos About Thanatos 01|Hypnos|I'll say! The lounge re-opened, let's see, what else... Anyway! You see my brother out there you tell him we've got everything here under control!
HypnosAboutThanatos02|Hypnos About Thanatos 02|Hypnos|Hey, did you see? My brother, he's come back! He's here! Somewhere, I think! Good old Thanatos. He's so busy all the time, he... never talks to me! Kind of like your dad with *you*, I guess!
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Hypnos|*Whaa*! Oh, hah, you just startled me there, is all, I was just... um... I...
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Zagreus|Hey, uh, everything all right, there, Hypnos?
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Hypnos|Oh, absolutely! Everything *definitely *is. It's just... it's Thanatos. He said some stuff, and... now I'm not so sure I'm doing the best job I can, you know?
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Zagreus|I'm sure he wasn't trying to hurt your feelings. Wait, what am I saying, he's always been harsh with you, hasn't he?
HypnosAboutThanatos03|Hypnos About Thanatos 03|Hypnos|Hey, what if he doesn't like me anymore? He's got other brothers!
HypnosAboutThanatos04|Hypnos About Thanatos 04|Hypnos|Oh hey! Um, this might be a little weird, but I, *uh*... thanks! I mean, you talked to Thanatos about me, right? At first I thought he was acting funny. But he has definitely been a lot nicer to me, lately!
HypnosAboutThanatos04|Hypnos About Thanatos 04|Zagreus|Come on, Hypnos, I didn't have anything to do with that. You seem like you've been working extra hard, and taking some of the feedback you've been getting to heart. I think Thanatos really appreciates that sort of thing. Who doesn't?
HypnosAboutThanatos04|Hypnos About Thanatos 04|Hypnos|I don't know! But I really appreciate that you went out of your way, I mean... I just stand here and greet and register the dead! But you? You're a real friend!
HypnosAboutThanatosRelationship01|Hypnos About Thanatos Relationship 01|Hypnos|Hey, there you are! So is it true?! You know, about you and Thanatos? Because he told me, and I just said, *whooooaaa*, but then, everything made sense?
HypnosAboutThanatosRelationship01|Hypnos About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|I'm sure whatever it is he said is completely true, yes, Hypnos.
HypnosAboutSleeperSeat01|Hypnos About Sleeper Seat 01|Hypnos|Hey, did you see? Somebody got me this incredible new sleeper-seat right here! Though, I would never lie down while on the job! I'm perfectly all right sleeping while standing up!
HypnosPostFlashback01|Hypnos Post Flashback 01|Zagreus|Hey, Hypnos? What would it take for you to let me through the locked door down the hall?
HypnosPostFlashback01|Hypnos Post Flashback 01|Hypnos|Oh, *hahaha*, that's a good one, you know I can't let you enter your dad's private chambers anymore, since you betrayed his trust and tried to run away from home! Sorry, Master's orders!
HypnosPostEnding01|Hypnos Post Ending 01|Hypnos|Hey, did you see?! The Queen's come back! Though, did she ever take her sweet time!
HypnosPostEnding01|Hypnos Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Hey watch it, Hypnos, that's my mother you're talking about!
HypnosPostEnding01|Hypnos Post Ending 01|Hypnos|What, really? *Huh*! So then *your *mom doesn't spend any time with you, either! We've got something in common!
HypnosPostEnding02|Hypnos Post Ending 02|Hypnos|Wait, wait, wait, so what's all this about you *working *here? I thought they fired you, and that was why you left!
HypnosPostEnding02|Hypnos Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Hypnos... you think all these times I've died, it's because I was upset I was let go from a miserable job?
HypnosPostEpilogue01|Hypnos Post Epilogue 01|Hypnos|I heard the feast you had here, it was really something else! All the gods, together in one place, eating, drinking, not killing one another! That must have been a sight.
HypnosPostEpilogue01|Hypnos Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|You should have been there, Hypnos! Not that I noticed your absence, though, what happened? Other pressing business?
HypnosPostEpilogue01|Hypnos Post Epilogue 01|Hypnos|Slept through the whole thing!
HypnosAutograph01|Hypnos Autograph 01|Zagreus|Hey, Hypnos? This is for all the well-meaning advice you've given me. A little something from a certain double-bladed-axe-wielding, bull-headed, oversized monster of a man who you admire?
HypnosAutograph01|Hypnos Autograph 01|Hypnos|What's this, it's kind of hard to read the hand-writing, it says, no way... *To Hypnos, my biggest fan. Stay vigilant. Asterius. *There's... even a little picture of a bull. You... I... wow... *wow*!
HypnosConsolation01|Hypnos Consolation 01|Hypnos|*Hoh*, says here one of the Wretched Thugs got you, too bad! They're slow but they hit pretty hard I guess. Have you tried moving out of the way?
HypnosConsolation01_B|Hypnos Consolation 01 B|Hypnos|According to my list here, why, you must've just got clobbered all the way back home by one of those Wretched Thugs again! The old moving-out-the-way trick didn't work, huh...?
HypnosConsolation02|Hypnos Consolation 02|Hypnos|Looks like one of the Wretched Witches shot you dead last time, sorry to hear that, huh? Have you tried shooting them first?
HypnosConsolation02_B|Hypnos Consolation 02 B|Hypnos|You must have had a run-in with a Spreader, huh! They're much more talented than the low-grade witches down in Tartarus, so your dad lets them stay warm up in Asphodel, I guess!
HypnosConsolation02_C|Hypnos Consolation 02 C|Hypnos|*Oof*, a Splitter zapped you, didn't she! There's lots of witches in your dad's place, huh? Witchcraft must be pretty dangerous for all those mortals up there. Pretty dangerous for you, too!
HypnosConsolation03|Hypnos Consolation 03|Hypnos|*Aw*, looks like you died from one of those nasty booby traps left by a Wretched Pest, little guys who look like urns? Have you tried avoiding them maybe?
HypnosConsolation04|Hypnos Consolation 04|Hypnos|*Ooh wow*, so Megaera herself got you last time, that must have been intense! She's fast, and strong, and beautiful, and... um... anyway, I hope the Fates are nicer to you next time!
HypnosConsolation04_B|Hypnos Consolation 04 B|Hypnos|*Hah*! Megaera the Fury got you again! She is unstoppable, isn't she? One time, I tried to stop her on the way to have a chat with your dad, and she didn't even turn her head! *<Sigh...>
HypnosConsolation04_C|Hypnos Consolation 04 C|Hypnos|You got *whipped *by Megaera the Fury! *Eh*?! I always wanted to say that. Whipped, you know? Referring both to how badly you lost, and to that glowy purple whip she's always threatening me with whenever I try to talk to her?
HypnosConsolation05|Hypnos Consolation 05|Hypnos|So you got skewered by a Spike Trap out there, huh? Well, that's too bad! Have you tried not standing there, like, when the spikes come out?
HypnosConsolation06|Hypnos Consolation 06|Hypnos|*Ooh *looks like one of those Dart Traps killed you last time, bet *that *must have hurt! Have you tried getting behind something?
HypnosConsolation07|Hypnos Consolation 07|Hypnos|*Ow *looks like you got blasted to bits by an explosive urn last time! We keep some really nasty shades all bottled up in those, but... you so much as touch them, *BOOM*! Hah!
HypnosConsolation08|Hypnos Consolation 08|Hypnos|*Whoaaa*, you just got killed by one of those Bloodless Inferno Bomber skeleton type guys, nice! I always wondered what would happen if you just kind of stood around while all their bombs went off!
HypnosConsolation09|Hypnos Consolation 09|Hypnos|*Owie*, looks like the Bone Hydra of Asphodel just stomped you that time, huh? I hear each of its heads has its own nasty tricks. That must be tough!
HypnosConsolation09_B|Hypnos Consolation 09 B|Hypnos|Bone Hydra got you again, huh? Real sorry about that. Though, you know what? I want you to get back out there, you know, all through Tartarus, and Asphodel, again, and knock some sense into it for me, OK? OK!
HypnosConsolation09_C|Hypnos Consolation 09 C|Hypnos|Wait let me guess, don't tell me... you got slaughtered by the Bone Hydra, again! How many times was that? But you will get 'em next time, I just know it! Maybe the time after that. Eventually, no doubt about it!
HypnosConsolation10|Hypnos Consolation 10|Hypnos|*Daw*, one of those Wretched Louts just killed you dead that time, those mean old slappy guys? Maybe try killing them beforehand, I don't know!
HypnosConsolation10_B|Hypnos Consolation 10 B|Hypnos|*Ooh*, says here a Wretched Lout slapped you to death again, that's a tough break! Have you tried talking it out, or something, I... I don't know?
HypnosConsolation11|Hypnos Consolation 11|Hypnos|Hey you got turned to ashes by those floating Brimstone crystally type things! Next time one's turning you to charcoal with those beams of theirs, how about you step on over to the side?
HypnosConsolation14|Hypnos Consolation 14|Hypnos|*Ooh*, ow, so you got burned down to a crisp out there, standing in magma, right? I know you've got your burning feet and all, but standing in magma, why, I'm not so sure that's a good idea!
HypnosConsolation15|Hypnos Consolation 15|Hypnos|*Huh*, so you walked straight into a burning magma spout, is that what got you this time? Bet if you waited long enough it'd cool off, instead of killing you!
HypnosConsolation16|Hypnos Consolation 16|Hypnos|*Hooh*, looks like one of those little Numbskulls took a big old bite right out of you back there, I guess they got you, huh? Maybe if you weren't quite so tasty, they'd leave you alone! And so would I!
HypnosConsolation16_B|Hypnos Consolation 16 B|Hypnos|Did you just get chomped by one of those little Numbskulls, again?! Oh, that is definitely rough. I guess you must have done something to make the Fates real mad!
HypnosConsolation16_C|Hypnos Consolation 16 C|Hypnos|*Oh, hohoh, *you got blown up by a Slam-Dancer, I can see it on your face! It also says it on my list! Got everybody's cause of death, right here. Some real morbid stuff from time to time! So anyway, take care!
HypnosConsolation17|Hypnos Consolation 17|Hypnos|Why you look like someone who just got beaten silly by a dirty skeleton! Beaten well beyond the brink of death, I ought to say! And, sure enough, according to my list, you did! Those Bloodless sure are tough!
HypnosConsolation18|Hypnos Consolation 18|Hypnos|My list here says that you got petrified to death that time by some sort of nasty floating gorgon head? No offense to Dusa! Sounds like a pretty painful way to go, though hey! At least you got to be a statue for a little while! I like statues.
HypnosConsolation19|Hypnos Consolation 19|Hypnos|*Pff*, can I just say *ouch*? Because according to the list here, you got flattened like a pancake by a Skull-Crusher, out in Asphodel somewhere! Keep that up and you're going to get even shorter, *haha*!
HypnosConsolation_HitAndRunUnit|Hypnos Consolation Hit And Run Unit|Hypnos|*Mmm*, you look like someone who just got turned to stone then crushed to a bloody pulp by the Megagorgon of Asphodel, am I right? Well, look, I'm sorry to hear that, and before you ask, I won't tell Dusa, don't you worry about that!
HypnosConsolation20|Hypnos Consolation 20|Hypnos|*Oh*, I recognize that look! That is the look of someone who just got here after having met a most unfortunate demise, courtesy of the notorious Bloodless Wave-Makers!! How do they make those waves, and why do they hurt so, *so *much? Plenty of time to think it over, now!
HypnosConsolation21|Hypnos Consolation 21|Hypnos|Looks like you *really *took the heat from one of those Bloodless Burn-Flingers back there, didn't you? I know how tempting it can be to try and catch those fiery explosive bombs they throw, but... if I might offer you a bit of personal advice? You really shouldn't do that.
HypnosConsolation22|Hypnos Consolation 22|Hypnos|Oh, *wow*, Alecto's got it out for you...? Normally she doesn't kill anyone, she likes keeping them alive... for quite a while, really. Hurts them still, but doesn't kill them off! I guess she really doesn't like you, huh!
HypnosConsolation_Tisiphone01|Hypnos Consolation Tisiphone 01|Hypnos|If you got killed by Tisiphone the Fury, why, then it must mean you've been accused of *murder*! A most heinous crime, as I'm to understand! Well, I hope you clear your name. Or whatever those mortals do about that stuff!
HypnosConsolation_ShadeSword01|Hypnos Consolation Shade Sword 01|Hypnos|So, you lost a duel to the death with an Exalted Brightsword, did you? They're pretty much the best of the best, so don't feel bad! It had to happen! But if it's any consolation, it'll probably happen again!
HypnosConsolation24|Hypnos Consolation 24|Hypnos|Says here that you got stuck like a piece of meat on a spit by an Exalted Longspear, *wow*, I'll bet that really hurt! Too bad you don't have a thick, leathery hide or something that could help protect you in that type of situation. Oh well!
HypnosConsolation25|Hypnos Consolation 25|Hypnos|Looks like you just got pounded down by an Exalted Greatshield, huh? Did you try attacking while their guard was down? Or, did they just not let down their guard at any point... *Oh*...
HypnosConsolation26|Hypnos Consolation 26|Hypnos|Let me guess, you got caught out by one of those Exalted Strongbows, did you there? Next time, if you don't stand around like you're doing here right now, maybe you won't make such an easy target!
HypnosConsolation27|Hypnos Consolation 27|Hypnos|My understanding is you had a little run-in with a Nemean Chariot, just kind of plowed right into you, there, didn't it? You got to watch where you're going crossing the streets of Elysium next time!
HypnosConsolation28|Hypnos Consolation 28|Hypnos|Those Archer Statues in Elysium have got to be a real sight, no doubt about it. But, you can't just stand there and admire them, or else they'll shoot you dead like they did just now!
HypnosConsolation29|Hypnos Consolation 29|Hypnos|Sounds to me like you got *stuck *in more ways than one gawking at a Phalanx Statue in Elysium back there! I got to hand it to your dad. He made sure those look just as good as they stab any intruders like yourself!
HypnosConsolation30|Hypnos Consolation 30|Hypnos|Says here that you got flash-fried to a crisp within a Phoenix Urn's destructive blast back there, I mean, you really ought to stay away from those, if you ask me!
HypnosConsolation31|Hypnos Consolation 31|Hypnos|*Woow*, I can't believe you took on the Minotaur, no way! No wonder you're back here! Everyone knows that he's unstoppable. Especially me! Hey, next you run into him, could you... get his autograph, for me?
HypnosConsolation31_B|Hypnos Consolation 31 B|Hypnos|The Minotaur killed you again, that must have been exciting, huh? *So*, any chance you got that autograph for me, before you got destroyed?
HypnosConsolation31_C|Hypnos Consolation 31 C|Hypnos|Slain by the Minotaur once more, now he's a real beast, there, isn't he! But, tell me something, any progress on that autograph request of mine?
HypnosConsolation32|Hypnos Consolation 32|Hypnos|Oh, I just knew that you'd be back, soon as I heard you faced the Champion of Elysium, himself! You know, I've heard that, among mortals, it's an honor to be killed by somebody like Theseus! Keep it up, and maybe you'll be famous, too!
HypnosConsolation32_B|Hypnos Consolation 32 B|Hypnos|Look, I have to say, I just don't think you have a real chance against both Theseus and the Minotaur, together! But, you might just have a chance to get the Minotaur's autograph for me, if maybe you ask nice or something?
HypnosConsolation32_C|Hypnos Consolation 32 C|Hypnos|Good, you're back! So, prior to when Theseus killed you again back there, did you, by any chance, happen to ask his big bull buddy for an autograph for me, this time?
HypnosConsolation33|Hypnos Consolation 33|Hypnos|Looks like somebody just found out that some types of butterflies are incredibly dangerous! Especially the ones that come swarming out of those Soul Catchers! If only you could just... not have a soul, or something? Then they'd bother somebody else!
HypnosConsolation34|Hypnos Consolation 34|Hypnos|So, one of those Flame Wheels drove right into you, and burst into a fiery explosion, killing both of you, is that what happened there? Well if it makes you feel any better, *technically*, I think this means you got your revenge!
HypnosConsolation35|Hypnos Consolation 35|Hypnos|You had a run-in with those nasty Satyrs all the way up in the Temple of Styx, huh. I can't even imagine the sheer agony, having their lethal poison coursing through my body!
HypnosConsolation36|Hypnos Consolation 36|Hypnos|You know, I've only heard the tales of the gigantic, vicious, flesh-eating vermin up there near the surface. Now I guess we both know that those tales are definitely true!
HypnosConsolation37|Hypnos Consolation 37|Hypnos|*Eugh*, it says here you got chewed up by an angry swarm of Crawlers somewhere just a stone's throw from the exit to your dad's domain? Talk about adding insult to injury, huh?
HypnosConsolation38|Hypnos Consolation 38|Hypnos|Oh, I heard the pests of Tartarus had bigger, meaner counterparts up near the surface, but... I guess you just found out the hard way, huh? When you tripped one of their explosive things?
HypnosConsolation39|Hypnos Consolation 39|Hypnos|I know that look, why, that's the look of someone just incinerated by a Snakestone, am I right? They spit a whole bunch of those white-hot, flesh-burning beams right at the same time, there, don't they?
HypnosConsolation40|Hypnos Consolation 40|Hypnos|Hey, you're back! Wait, wait, what happened? My list says you got killed by a *Redacted*, what's that even mean? I've never seen anything like this!
HypnosConsolation40_B|Hypnos Consolation 40 B|Hypnos|Redacteds got you again, huh. Here's the thing, I keep asking around about them and no one seems to know what I'm talking about! Could you maybe describe them for me, please?
HypnosConsolation40_C|Hypnos Consolation 40 C|Hypnos|*Huh*, that's funny. Nothing on my list at all this time, except... I could have sworn I saw you walk right out of the Pool back there. I'll have to have this thing looked at.
HypnosConsolation41|Hypnos Consolation 41|Hypnos|The list is telling me you caught one of those gigantic Temple saw blades square in the chest, huh? *Eugh*... At least you're back in one piece!
HypnosConsolation42|Hypnos Consolation 42|Hypnos|What's the matter, there, you got a *splitting *headache from those giant falling axes in the Temple of Styx? Well I have just the cure, which is: Don't get hit by them!
HypnosConsolation_PoisonTrap|Hypnos Consolation Poison Trap|Hypnos|Well *somebody *just walked into a cloud of noxious gas, there, huh! Must have lost all your vital functions pretty quickly after that! Next time, you'll know it's seriously deadly stuff, because it killed you! And because it's green!
HypnosConsolation_BiomeTimer|Hypnos Consolation Biome Timer|Hypnos|So, you just plain ran out of time and died, all according to the Pact of Punishment, there, huh? Now that is what I call a *dead*line, *hahahaha*!
HypnosConsolation_GunGrenadeDropTrait|Hypnos Consolation Gun Grenade Drop Trait|Hypnos|Why, says here you just blew yourself right up that time, with that weird infernal shooty thing you stole? Remember, next time, shoot the *other *guys!
HypnosConsolation_MiniBossCrawler01|Hypnos Consolation Mini Boss Crawler 01|Hypnos|Whoa, wait wait wait, this just can't be right, it says, it says... *hahahahah*, you got beaten by a tiny little rodent? Oh, *haha*, sorry I just, I, you have my sympathies.
HypnosConsolation_DiedEarly01|Hypnos Consolation Died Early 01|Hypnos|Wait, *what*, you're back *already*? Hey, my list says that you barely made it out of here before you died! Were you even trying? Because if you were, why, maybe you need to try a whole lot *harder *than that next time!
HypnosConsolation_Wringer01|Hypnos Consolation Wringer 01|Hypnos|*Oh*, you got throttled by a Wringer, must have grabbed and crushed you like a grape! You know what grapes are, right? They're like big, squishy pomegranate seeds.
HypnosConsolation_HeavyRangedSplitter01|Hypnos Consolation Heavy Ranged Splitter 01|Hypnos|*Ah*, looks like you ran smack into the Doomstone out in Tartarus, thing gives me the creeps! Next time, try standing perfectly still. That way, it'll all be over that much faster!
HypnosConsolation_WretchAssassin01|Hypnos Consolation Wretch Assassin 01|Hypnos|Hey, you're the latest victim of a Wretched Sneak, that's something, right? They like to get you when you least expect it, so next time, why not keep spinning around and around? Then you'll catch them trying to sneak up!
HypnosConsolation_RangedBurrower01|Hypnos Consolation Ranged Burrower 01|Hypnos|So, let me guess, one minute you were minding your own business out in Asphodel, and then the next, one of those Dracons pops up right in front of you and *pfeh*! Just kills you dead with noxious acid breath. *Ah*, well! It happens, right?
HypnosConsolation_BloodlessBerserker01|Hypnos Consolation Bloodless Berserker 01|Hypnos|Going toe-to-toe with one of those Bloodless Bone-Rakers didn't go so well, *huh*? Next time they're ripping you to shreds, remember: That's your signal to be someplace else, instead!
HypnosConsolation_BulletHellWitches01|Hypnos Consolation Bullet Hell Witches 01|Hypnos|*Wow*, you just barged into the Witches Circle out in Asphodel, and they just filled you full of all those stinging purple orbs and killed you, huh? You can't just show up expecting to join their club! You have to study witchcraft for *years*!
HypnosConsolation_Charon01|Hypnos Consolation Charon 01|Hypnos|Hey, my brother *Charon *killed you, am I seeing this right? He's never been particularly nice to *me*! Whacked me with his oar a couple times, but it never got *that *bad. Must be some misunderstanding, have you talked to him?
HypnosConsolation_Charon02|Hypnos Consolation Charon 02|Hypnos|You had it out with Charon again, huh? And turned out like it did before! The thing you have to understand is he's got *lots *of upper body strength. You seen the definition in his arms? Maybe try some rowing for yourself!
HypnosConsolation_BWrapping01|Hypnos Consolation B Wrapping 01|Hypnos|So you met a violent end aboard the infamous Barge of Death sailing the river of flame! Surrounded by skeletons bleeding you dry, Voidstones making all of them invincible...! Have you thought about taking a different barge?
HypnosConsolation_RunCleared01|Hypnos Consolation Run Cleared 01|Hypnos|Whoa, what happened to you, you just... died? You just plain *died*, like... nothing stabbed you, bludgeoned you, poisoned you, burned you, crushed you, blew you to bits, turned you to stone, but... you're back here! Must have been those *Natural Causes *mortals talk about!
HypnosConsolation_RunCleared02|Hypnos Consolation Run Cleared 02|Hypnos|Natural Causes got you again, huh? That's a real shame, I mean, imagine one day you're just going about your business, and then *ack*!! You're *dead*! Although I guess *you *don't have to imagine it like *I *do!
HypnosConsolation_RunCleared03|Hypnos Consolation Run Cleared 03|Hypnos|Darned Natural Causes got you once again, there, didn't they? Well, you show them next time! Would you do that for me, *huh*?
HypnosWithHades01|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (1)|Hades|...You're late with your report, Hypnos. Again. Again! The dead of course can wait, but I'm less patient. Now, explain yourself to me.
HypnosWithHades01|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (1)|Hypnos|*Oh*! Well, let's see, I woke up, I don't know what time it was, and I made sure that every shade had been accounted for, just like I always do, except I couldn't find my list at first, can you believe it? I thought maybe my brother played a little prank, and so...
HypnosWithHades01|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (1)|Hades|Get to the blasted point already, I don't have all day! Or night. *Urgh*! Your report, where is it?
HypnosWithHades01|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (1)|Hypnos|Sure I was just getting to it, Master! My list, I found it over by the lounge, it was inside, but I am not the one who put it there, no sir! So I've been making positively sure it's not been tampered with, that it has everybody's name, cause of death, place of birth, former body weight, any previous allergies or medications...
HypnosWithHades01|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (1)|Hades|*Enough*!! Blood and darkness, that's enough from you, just... see to it the ledger of the dead is accurate, and get back to your post. *Ugh*, would that you could be more like your brother.
HypnosWithHades02|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (2)|Hades|...Your reports have been much more punctual of late, Hypnos. That is to be expected. However... the illustrated edges... a clever detail. Ensures certain reports are easily procured from a stack of parchment.
HypnosWithHades02|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (2)|Hypnos|Oh, *thanks*, Master, glad you like those! Ever since Thanatos made pretty clear to me I was about to lose my job, I started keeping a list of my *own *tasks, which I sort through each day, deciding on priority, estimating time to completion, cost-benefit analysis...
HypnosWithHades02|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (2)|Hades|Yes, well. Certainly, then, you have a number of such tasks requiring your attention. Continue working diligently, then.
HypnosWithHades03|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (3)|Hypnos|Master, I just can't thank you enough for putting my picture on the board there in the lounge! I heard it's a good picture! I haven't had time to see it yet, but I am going to, it's on the list!
HypnosWithHades03|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (3)|Hades|Hypnos... that shall be all. Lest I rescind your commendation and cast you out of here.
HypnosWithHades03|Duo - Hypnos and Hades (3)|Hypnos|....Um, could you say all that again with smaller words, Master, because I thought it maybe sounded kind of *bad*?
HypnosWithNyx01|Duo - Hypnos and Nyx (1)|Hypnos|...I just get sleepy, sometimes, Mom, I mean, I've been working so *much*, lately, just over there? You've probably seen me, greeting shades, making my list, creating a welcoming environment...
HypnosWithNyx01|Duo - Hypnos and Nyx (1)|Nyx|Remember what we previously spoke of, Hypnos. Do not address me thus whilst we are here. Conduct yourself as befitting a servant of the House of Hades... and, continue practicing your independence, please.
HypnosWithNyx02|Duo - Hypnos and Nyx (2)|Nyx|You have demonstrated sustained competence in your duties, Hypnos. It gladdens me to see measurable progress. Your efforts are to be commended.
HypnosWithNyx02|Duo - Hypnos and Nyx (2)|Hypnos|Aw, wow, *thanks*! Commended by whom, exactly? Megaera? Thanatos? Dusa, maybe! Not the Master himself?!
HypnosWithNyx02|Duo - Hypnos and Nyx (2)|Nyx|Commended by me. I cannot always look after all of my children, as you know. It falls upon them to take care of themselves, as well as their obligations to our domain. As your mother... it is reassuring to see that you are capable.
HypnosWithNyx02|Duo - Hypnos and Nyx (2)|Hypnos|Capable? Me? *Aw*, Mom... I mean, um, *Mother Nyx*! Nobody's *ever *called me that before!
HypnosWithNyx02|Duo - Hypnos and Nyx (2)|Nyx|You are my son. It is to be expected. However... I know it is not effortless, to be of use. Continue to do well. I shall be watching.
HypnosWithPersephone01|Duo - Hypnos and Persephone (1)|Hypnos|...And if you ever need *anything *at all, Your Royalness, you can *always *find me wide awake, right over there! Though I really shouldn't leave my post like this! Not even for *you*!
HypnosChat01|Hypnos Chat 01|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades! Glory in Death!
HypnosChat02|Hypnos Chat 02|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, where death is our life!
HypnosChat03|Hypnos Chat 03|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, where death is our business!
HypnosChat04|Hypnos Chat 04|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades, and thanks for dying!
HypnosChat05|Hypnos Chat 05|Hypnos|Just keeping watch over the Pool of Styx, there, same as always!
HypnosChat06|Hypnos Chat 06|Hypnos|They won't catch me sleeping on the job again!
HypnosChat07|Hypnos Chat 07|Hypnos|Oh, hey, I didn't see you come in, *um*... welcome back!
HypnosChat08|Hypnos Chat 08|Hypnos|*Whoa*, I guess you must have died out there again, huh.
HypnosChat09|Hypnos Chat 09|Hypnos|Oh, *whoa*, you're back already, that's too bad!
HypnosChat10|Hypnos Chat 10|Hypnos|Oh, hi, um, you're welcome! Just, go right ahead, I guess!
HypnosChat11|Hypnos Chat 11|Hypnos|*Um*, I was just resting my eyes... you won't tell anybody, right?
HypnosChat12|Hypnos Chat 12|Hypnos|Well, you know what they say: There is no escape!
HypnosChat13|Hypnos Chat 13|Hypnos|Hey, you look like you could use some sleep!
HypnosChat14|Hypnos Chat 14|Hypnos|Oh, it's you, just, come on in, you're on the list!
HypnosChat15|Hypnos Chat 15|Hypnos|You're back, huh? That was pretty soon I guess!
HypnosChat16|Hypnos Chat 16|Hypnos|You must be pretty used to dying like this, huh?
HypnosChat18|Hypnos Chat 18|Hypnos|The Fates are pretty mean to keep on doing this to you!
HypnosChat19|Hypnos Chat 19|Hypnos|Thanks for dying, nice to see you here again!
HypnosChat20|Hypnos Chat 20|Hypnos|Go right ahead, I'll get you all signed in!
HypnosChat21|Hypnos Chat 21|Hypnos|Good thing you're basically immortal, huh?
HypnosChat22|Hypnos Chat 22|Hypnos|Guess you're here to stay, *hah-ha*!
HypnosChat23|Hypnos Chat 23|Hypnos|There's always next time, isn't there?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat01|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 01|Hypnos|How's my best friend doing, *huh*?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat02|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 02|Hypnos|You'll get them next time, right?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat03|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 03|Hypnos|Don't let me keep you, huh?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat04|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 04|Hypnos|Signed you in, you're good to go!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat05|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 05|Hypnos|I like having a best friend!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat06|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 06|Hypnos|Glad you died so I could talk to you!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat07|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 07|Hypnos|Nice to have a heart-to-heart like this, you know?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat08|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 08|Hypnos|See you next time you die, OK?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat09|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 09|Hypnos|Hope you enjoy your stay!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat10|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 10|Hypnos|I've got a survey here if you'd like to fill it out?
HypnosHighRelationshipChat11|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 11|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of Hades! Just come on in!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat12|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 12|Hypnos|Welcome to the House of... oh, you know!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat13|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 13|Hypnos|Welcome back to our most frequent guest!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat14A|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 14 A|Hypnos|I want you to go out there, and *die *some other way!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat14|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 14|Hypnos|There's no escape, in case you hadn't heard!
HypnosHighRelationshipChat15|Hypnos High Relationship Chat 15|Hypnos|You can *do *this! Whatever it is you're doing!
HypnosGift01|Hypnos Gift 01|Zagreus|Surprise, Hypnos! I got you this.
HypnosGift01|Hypnos Gift 01|Hypnos|Whoa whoa *whoa *you can't bring that in here! Hah, just kidding, thanks! But wait, I'll trade you, look!
HypnosGift02|Hypnos Gift 02|Hypnos|Oh! Wow! Thanks! This is real nice of you, hah! I sure am glad you died out there just now!
HypnosGift02|Hypnos Gift 02|Zagreus|I'm glad I died, as well, Hypnos! I'm glad I died, as well.
HypnosGift03|Hypnos Gift 03|Hypnos|Ah, neat! *Huh*, thanks!! It's not so bad that you keep coming back like this, is it? At least for me it isn't!
HypnosGift03|Hypnos Gift 03|Zagreus|I'm getting used to it. Though I don't think I'd feel particularly welcome anymore if not for you, Hypnos.
HypnosGift04|Hypnos Gift 04|Hypnos|*Whoaaa *you must've really gotten pretty far out there if you could get me one of these, so, wow! And thanks for stopping by!
HypnosGift04|Hypnos Gift 04|Zagreus|You lighten up my numerous untimely deaths, Hypnos.
HypnosGift05|Hypnos Gift 05|Hypnos|Hah, well this is like a dream come true! I mean, how come you're always being so darn nice to me? But anyway, *um*, thanks!
HypnosGift05|Hypnos Gift 05|Zagreus|Sure thing, Hypnos! Knock yourself out.
HypnosGift06|Hypnos Gift 06|Hypnos|Oh you are just the best, I bet you died on purpose just to get this back to me, didn't you! Didn't you?
HypnosGift06|Hypnos Gift 06|Zagreus|I have a secret, Hypnos. I've died on purpose every single time, just to see you.
HypnosGift07|Hypnos Gift 07|Zagreus|Hypnos, wanted to say you have really helped the thought of my coming back here time after time, painful death by death, not be inherently abhorrent. Your greetings really help! So I wanted you to have this.
HypnosGift07|Hypnos Gift 07|Hypnos|But, but, but, wait, this, it's *Ambrosia*! You are not supposed to have this here! We could both get in a lot of trouble, and I mean a *lot*, if they catch us in the middle of this totally forbidden exchange!
HypnosGift07|Hypnos Gift 07|Zagreus|I notice that you haven't yet returned the bottle to me, which I'm going to take as an indication that you're going to hang onto it.
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Zagreus|One more forbidden exchange, Hypnos. Sometimes when I'm out there and about to die, I catch myself thinking... well, at least Hypnos will share one of his deep insights about why it is I utterly failed. So here! For all your generous advice.
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Hypnos|Aww, I... feel like I am going to cry, I mean, all my advice is free! You really didn't have to do this. But I sure am glad you did! Even if it is highly illegal! I... I... I...!
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Zagreus|You what, Hypnos? You what?
HypnosGift08|Hypnos Gift 08|Hypnos|...I think you could be my best friend! Have you... tried being my best friend?
ThanatosHomeFirstMeeting|Thanatos Home First Meeting|Thanatos|Go about your business, Zag. What if Lord Hades saw us chatting like this, now...? I risked everything by helping you out there, and still you failed.
ThanatosHomeFirstMeeting|Thanatos Home First Meeting|Zagreus|Turns out there's quite a lot of dead to fight down in the Underworld. Though I probably got farther than I would have, thanks to you.
ThanatosHomeFirstMeeting|Thanatos Home First Meeting|Thanatos|Always happy to oblige. Especially when it causes me to risk my station. To risk everything I've worked for.
ThanatosHomeFirstMeetingAlt|Thanatos Home First Meeting Alt|Thanatos|What are you doing back here, Zagreus? I risked everything by helping you out there. So that was all for nothing, then?
ThanatosHomeFirstMeetingAlt|Thanatos Home First Meeting Alt|Zagreus|Far from it, Than. I got where I needed to go, and if not for your help, maybe I wouldn't have. As for why I'm back... as Father would say, I have some business to attend to, here.
ThanatosHomeFirstMeetingAlt|Thanatos Home First Meeting Alt|Thanatos|Well! Don't let me stop you, then. Always happy to risk my station for your sake. To risk everything I've worked for.
ThanatosHomeMiscMeeting01|Thanatos Home Misc Meeting 01|Thanatos|Be on your way, Zagreus. I have an audience with Lord Hades in a moment. An inquiry into my recent absences.
ThanatosHomeMiscMeeting01|Thanatos Home Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|What are you worried about, Than? You've never given him a reason not to trust you.
ThanatosHomeMiscMeeting01|Thanatos Home Misc Meeting 01|Thanatos|Recently, I'm not so sure. Whatever you're doing, it had better be worth it.
ThanatosHomeRunProgress01|Thanatos Home Run Progress 01|Thanatos|I still cannot entirely believe you really think there's any way you're getting out of here.
ThanatosHomeRunProgress01|Thanatos Home Run Progress 01|Zagreus|Why? You've been out. It's thanks to you the mortals end up down here maybe half the time.
ThanatosHomeRunProgress01|Thanatos Home Run Progress 01|Thanatos|That's different, that's my job. I can't stay there, and frankly I can barely stand it. Do you have any idea how bright it gets, up there?
ThanatosHomeRunProgress01|Thanatos Home Run Progress 01|Zagreus|No. But I look forward to finding out for myself.
ThanatosHomeRunProgress01|Thanatos Home Run Progress 01|Thanatos|*Tsch*, well. We'll see what the Fates have to say about that. Maybe the shade of Daedalus can make you some protective eyewear or something.
ThanatosHomeRunProgress02|Thanatos Home Run Progress 02|Zagreus|Thanatos, the world outside... didn't you say that it would make you sick, being out there for very long at all? I understand now what you meant by that. Beautiful place and all, but... it's good to be back.
ThanatosHomeRunProgress02|Thanatos Home Run Progress 02|Thanatos|See what I mean, now, Zag? Nice place to visit on occasion, sure. But I definitely wouldn't want to live there.
ThanatosBackstory01|Thanatos Backstory 01|Thanatos|I met her, you know. Persephone, I mean. You look more like your father, but... you have her eyes. One of them, anyway.
ThanatosBackstory01|Thanatos Backstory 01|Zagreus|You never spoke of her to me. You must have known... you kept the truth from me, the same as Nyx?
ThanatosBackstory01|Thanatos Backstory 01|Thanatos|It's not like that. I didn't know any more than you. Besides, Lord Hades ordered all of us to never speak of her again. I thought it just a bad relationship. I didn't realize she left her son.
ThanatosBackstory01|Thanatos Backstory 01|Zagreus|Something tells me Father wouldn't let her take me even if she wanted.
ThanatosBackstory01|Thanatos Backstory 01|Thanatos|Maybe so. But even still, she did abandon you. Your family's here, if you ask me. But I can understand that... you need answers.
ThanatosBackstory02|Thanatos Backstory 02|Zagreus|Hey, Than. Come join me in the lounge for old time's sake. The coast is clear. The work can wait.
ThanatosBackstory02|Thanatos Backstory 02|Thanatos|You're really asking me to join you for a drink...? I mean... you know what, sure. The work can wait.
ThanatosBackstory02|Thanatos Backstory 02|Thanatos|...I somehow knew, you know. I always knew you weren't going to stay. You were... so restless here. You just needed a reason to leave! And I hoped you wouldn't find one this quickly. *Eugh*. What am I saying? You have no idea.
ThanatosBackstory02|Thanatos Backstory 02|Zagreus|No, I know exactly what you're saying, Than. I'm sorry that I'm putting you through all of this, it's just... it's something that I have to do. But, I'm glad we know the truth about me, now. Maybe we can move on from there.
ThanatosBackstory02|Thanatos Backstory 02|Thanatos|*Tsk*... I've always lacked your optimism, Zag. Anyway... the work has waited long enough, I need to get back to it. Thanks for the drink.
ThanatosBackstory02|Thanatos Backstory 02|Thanatos|...Watch yourself out there, Zagreus. I have to go.
ThanatosAboutDeath01|Thanatos About Death 01|Zagreus|Thanatos, I've meant to ask... is it really the case that many mortals have a crippling fear of death?
ThanatosAboutDeath01|Thanatos About Death 01|Thanatos|It is, I'm quite feared, up there. Most of them cannot distinguish between me, and, say, Lord Ares, or your father, even. We fill them with despair. No helping it.
ThanatosAboutDeath01|Thanatos About Death 01|Zagreus|Why not? I mean, isn't it kind of a big problem that they have such negative associations, here? Can't we... I don't know, do something to educate them all?
ThanatosAboutDeath01|Thanatos About Death 01|Thanatos|We've all the time to educate them, here. Their ignorance of death is solved almost as soon as they experience their first. Though I suppose they might be better off knowing before the fact.
ThanatosAboutDeath02|Thanatos About Death 02|Zagreus|Than? I had another question about death. So... why is it mortals grieve so much about the thing, I mean... it definitely hurts there for a little while, but... it's not that bad.
ThanatosAboutDeath02|Thanatos About Death 02|Thanatos|They see it as their one and only chance. Imagine if, after you perished, that was it. Back to the infinite Chaos. Everything about you. Returned to how it was before you were even there.
ThanatosAboutDeath02|Thanatos About Death 02|Zagreus|But that's absurd. One life? Though... *eugh*. That's horrible, even to think about.
ThanatosAboutDeath02|Thanatos About Death 02|Thanatos|I know, right? Some of them know that isn't how it is, and try to tell their kind about what it is we do here, but... it's slow going, getting the information out. Either way! I get to be the bearer of good news.
ThanatosAboutDeath03|Thanatos About Death 03|Zagreus|Hey Than? Something's been troubling me still, with what you said, about how mortals look at death. If most of them believe their life is all they have... how do they live? I mean, I can't even imagine what that's like. I'd be a lot more careful, at the very least!
ThanatosAboutDeath03|Thanatos About Death 03|Thanatos|They live with all their hearts, or at least try. I think there's something to it, truthfully. Though, some of them, they fall apart. They get here without me. On their own, gripped with despair. If only they knew what your father always says about all this.
ThanatosAboutDeath03|Thanatos About Death 03|Zagreus|What, you mean that *'there is no escape'*? From what? The mortals are up there, not here. Not while they're technically alive in their sense, anyway.
ThanatosAboutDeath03|Thanatos About Death 03|Thanatos|I mean, you can't escape your problems, Zagreus. You can run from your family, but you can't run from everything. You have no choice but to confront it, and work through it, sooner or later, one way or another. You, and all of us.
ThanatosAboutDeath03|Thanatos About Death 03|Zagreus|...I'm starting to notice that, yes. Though, to a mortal who has yet to die... don't they think of death as some sort of release? You come to end their misery, something like that?
ThanatosAboutDeath03|Thanatos About Death 03|Thanatos|I can release them from their decaying bodies. Sometimes, the Fates demand I bring them in sooner. That's about as much as I can do. Some of them get it early on, how to live. It's quite impressive, really, that they learn so quick.
ThanatosAboutShifting01|Thanatos About Shifting 01|Zagreus|Hey, just how far are you able to shift, anyway, Than? I never could go more than a blade's length in front of me, while you're out there skipping across the entire world probably.
ThanatosAboutShifting01|Thanatos About Shifting 01|Thanatos|Most of it, yes. Don't beat yourself up, though, Zagreus. It's a practiced skill but I've apparently been able to do it since birth. Mother Nyx says I was a real handful.
ThanatosAboutBalcony01|Thanatos About Balcony 01|Zagreus|Hey, what is it you're always staring at out there, anyway, Than? I don't see anything.
ThanatosAboutBalcony01|Thanatos About Balcony 01|Thanatos|The River Styx is right in front of you, and you don't see anything, Zag? I can watch it endlessly. Studying the competition, you might say. Most mortals expect to get here by river, with Charon. Not with me.
ThanatosAboutBalcony01|Thanatos About Balcony 01|Zagreus|So you're locked in ruthless battle with a river, searching it for any signs of weakness, that sort of thing? That sounds stressful.
ThanatosAboutBalcony01|Thanatos About Balcony 01|Thanatos|I find it rather soothing as a matter of fact. A break from having to deal constantly with mortal souls. Speaking of which... I have to pick somebody up right now.
ThanatosAboutNemesisAspect01|Thanatos About Nemesis Aspect 01|Zagreus|Than, my blade, the one I'm borrowing from Father anyway, it... revealed to me an older aspect of itself, of Nemesis. Nyx never mentions her. Have you two ever met?
ThanatosAboutNemesisAspect01|Thanatos About Nemesis Aspect 01|Thanatos|In case you haven't noticed, most of us who sprang from Nyx, we're not exactly close. Nemesis is fully occupied meting out justice on the surface. Our paths are not designed to cross. And based on everything I know, that's fine with me.
ThanatosAboutErisAspect01|Thanatos About Eris Aspect 01|Thanatos|How's that Rail of Adamant been working out for you lately? Always figured the direct approach was more your style. Though, I happened to have a look at your permanent record lately, and turns out you're doing a lot of work with that thing.
ThanatosAboutErisAspect01|Thanatos About Eris Aspect 01|Zagreus|Why, Thanatos, you're learning to pry in others' business! The Rail's been working out just fine, thanks. Though, now that you mention it, how well do you know Eris, one of Nyx's daughters, right? Seems she wielded the Rail before me.
ThanatosAboutErisAspect01|Thanatos About Eris Aspect 01|Thanatos|The mortals call her Strife. She and her children... it's thanks partly to their dedicated efforts I'm so busy all the time. Though, it is best we didn't speak of her, I think.
ThanatosAboutSurface01|Thanatos About Surface 01|Zagreus|Thanatos, I ought have asked by now, but... what's it like? Up there I mean, outside. You never talk about it, I... almost forget that's where you go, for work.
ThanatosAboutSurface01|Thanatos About Surface 01|Thanatos|What can I say? It's... different. I never stay up there for very long, don't think I could, starts making me feel ill. Too many sensations all at once. And when the chariot of Helios is in the sky, it gets so bright that I can barely see.
ThanatosAboutSurface01|Thanatos About Surface 01|Zagreus|That sounds awful. If it's that bad, why would all the Olympians chat it up so much?
ThanatosAboutSurface01|Thanatos About Surface 01|Thanatos|There's no accounting for their taste, I guess. But, I'm discounting certain aspects that are not so bad. You know what? I'll not spoil the surprise. I have a feeling you're going to see for yourself soon enough.
ThanatosAboutSurface01_B|Thanatos About Surface 01 B|Zagreus|Thanatos, I ought have asked by now, but... what's it like? Up there I mean, outside. You never talk about it, I... almost forget that's where you go, for work.
ThanatosAboutSurface01_B|Thanatos About Surface 01 B|Thanatos|What can I say? It's... different. I never stay up there for very long, don't think I could, starts making me feel ill. Too many sensations all at once. And when the chariot of Helios is in the sky, it gets so bright that I can barely see.
ThanatosAboutSurface01_B|Thanatos About Surface 01 B|Zagreus|That sounds awful. If it's that bad, why would all the Olympians chat it up so much?
ThanatosAboutSurface01_B|Thanatos About Surface 01 B|Thanatos|There's no accounting for their taste, I guess.
ThanatosAboutCharon01|Thanatos About Charon 01|Zagreus|What's going on with Charon, by the way, if you can tell me, Than? He's... never been particularly talkative, but he really seems to know the inner workings of this place.
ThanatosAboutCharon01|Thanatos About Charon 01|Thanatos|I correspond with Charon all the time, but even I don't know the full extent of his responsibilities. He's an independent contractor of sorts, been here forever. Your father gives him plenty of space to work.
ThanatosAboutCharon01|Thanatos About Charon 01|Zagreus|He must be compensated pretty well for having done this for so long. Tending the influx of new souls and all of that.
ThanatosAboutCharon01|Thanatos About Charon 01|Thanatos|I doubt he's in it for the compensation, Zagreus. There is no Underworld without Charon. I think he knows that, and your father knows it, too.
ThanatosAboutCharon02A|Thanatos About Charon 02 A|Zagreus|Hey, were you ever close with Charon, Than? Seems like no matter how much I try, I can't quite get through to him.
ThanatosAboutCharon02A|Thanatos About Charon 02 A|Thanatos|Wouldn't be surprised if you were closer to him than I am. Not all of Nyx's sons and daughters keep in steady touch. Though at least we're not always at each others' throats, like the other side of your family.
ThanatosAboutCharon02|Thanatos About Charon 02|Zagreus|Than, you're not going to believe this, but... Charon's been helping me. All on his own, apparently! I was so sure that Nyx or someone put him up to it. That Skelly character I mentioned, Charon hired him!
ThanatosAboutCharon02|Thanatos About Charon 02|Thanatos|What are you talking about, Zagreus? Just because Charon's selling you things doesn't mean he's helping you. Wait, are you sure?
ThanatosAboutCharon02|Thanatos About Charon 02|Zagreus|I'm sure! His helper, Skelly, he's a lot more talkative, and finally let on. Although, he couldn't tell me how come Charon did a thing like this, I mean... we weren't ever close...
ThanatosAboutCharon02|Thanatos About Charon 02|Thanatos|*Hmm*. All I can think of is... Charon's very dedicated to this House. Like some of us. Maybe he thought... he could help settle things, between you and your father. One way or another.
ThanatosAboutCharonFight01|Thanatos About Charon Fight 01|Zagreus|Hey, Than, now hypothetically, if I were to have vanquished Charon in single combat after having, I don't know, say, helped myself to one of his wares at no charge, how long would you say he'd hold it over me?
ThanatosAboutCharonFight01|Thanatos About Charon Fight 01|Thanatos|Everything is an exchange with Charon, Zag. If there was something you refused to pay for, then I'm going to assume that's why you're back here, now. The debt is paid in obols, or in blood. Or their closest counterparts, I guess.
ThanatosAboutSkelly01|Thanatos About Skelly 01|Zagreus|Than, level with me on this. You didn't happen to hire a shifty character called Skelly to assist me here and there, did you?
ThanatosAboutSkelly01|Thanatos About Skelly 01|Thanatos|Who, what? No. Why would you even ask?
ThanatosAboutPersephone01|Thanatos About Persephone 01|Zagreus|Do you remember anything else about my mother, Than? Just, anything. You weren't close, I guess?
ThanatosAboutPersephone01|Thanatos About Persephone 01|Thanatos|We weren't. She kept to herself as I recall, and I would do the same. Unlike my present company, I do not ask too many questions. It was quite clear to me she wasn't from this place.
ThanatosAboutPersephone01|Thanatos About Persephone 01|Zagreus|Father isn't from this place, either. How was she any different?
ThanatosAboutPersephone01|Thanatos About Persephone 01|Thanatos|Sometimes I have to be reminded that Lord Hades wasn't born here, like the rest of us. But Persephone, she... she had a radiance about her, I suppose. Reminded me of the outside, but... I don't mean that in a negative respect.
ThanatosAboutSisyphus01|Thanatos About Sisyphus 01|Zagreus|Than, you don't hold a grudge against old Sisyphus, do you? He seems rather apprehensive about you. I understand you met not on the best of terms.
ThanatosAboutSisyphus01|Thanatos About Sisyphus 01|Thanatos|He is a brazen one, I have to give him that. I hadn't realized that you were close. Despite some questionable choices on your part, I don't think you're the poorest judge of character, and so... maybe I have him wrong.
ThanatosAboutSisyphus01|Thanatos About Sisyphus 01|Zagreus|I only have a faint impression of the man he used to be, although it seems he's changed a lot, since then. Thank you for understanding, anyway.
ThanatosAboutSisyphusLiberationQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|I heard you stayed the knave-king's sentence. I should be angry with you. Sisyphus must be the only mortal *ever *to have humiliated me. But Mother Nyx, she... must have backed you, didn't she...
ThanatosAboutSisyphusLiberationQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|We did what needed to be done. As much as Father likes making examples out of wretched shades, an eternal sentence felt a little excessive in this case. Besides... Sisyphus isn't leaving, anyway. Seems to have found his niche.
ThanatosAboutSisyphusLiberationQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|Oh? Well, he's an odd one through and through, I guess. As long as I don't have to deal with him again.
ThanatosAboutAchilles01|Thanatos About Achilles 01|Zagreus|You and Achilles ever get to talk much, Than?
ThanatosAboutAchilles01|Thanatos About Achilles 01|Thanatos|I have my orders, he has his. What do you think? Even back when he was still alive, there was no real chance I was going to be the one to take him here, given his line of work.
ThanatosAboutAchilles01|Thanatos About Achilles 01|Zagreus|Because he was a warrior. When mortals die a violent death, they're no longer your case, are they?
ThanatosAboutAchilles01|Thanatos About Achilles 01|Thanatos|No. I tend to those in less of a hurry to come here.
ThanatosAboutMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|Your trainer's been absent from his post, more so than usual. You voided his pact with Lord Hades, didn't you? I don't know how you did it.
ThanatosAboutMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|You know he's more than my trainer, Than. As for how I did it, turns out being the first and only son of Hades has its privileges. Now Achilles gets to be with someone he loves. Who loves him back.
ThanatosAboutMyrmidonReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Myrmidon Reunion Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|Love is common among mortals. Is theirs really so special as to be worth the trouble? Not just on your part, but theirs?
ThanatosAboutMegaera01|Thanatos About Megaera 01|Thanatos|You've seen a lot of Megaera lately, haven't you, Zag?
ThanatosAboutMegaera01|Thanatos About Megaera 01|Zagreus|It's not like that, Than. She's there to slow me down. Get in my way.
ThanatosAboutMegaera01|Thanatos About Megaera 01|Thanatos|If you insist. Although I think it's much more complicated than you say.
ThanatosAboutMegaera01|Thanatos About Megaera 01|Zagreus|Yeah... her sisters are back. They're... hard to deal with. I don't think Meg is on good terms with either one.
ThanatosAboutMegaera01|Thanatos About Megaera 01|Thanatos|That's not what I meant. But fine, you've told me all I need to know, for now.
ThanatosAboutMegaera02|Thanatos About Megaera 02|Zagreus|You and Meg go back a long way, don't you? I forget sometimes you two are pretty close.
ThanatosAboutMegaera02|Thanatos About Megaera 02|Thanatos|Our responsibilities must have us cross paths often, yes. But I didn't really get to know her until after the whole humiliating affair with Sisyphus.
ThanatosAboutMegaera02|Thanatos About Megaera 02|Zagreus|Oh, right. He got stuck in Tartarus after that, under Meg's personal supervision. So you bonded over your shared disdain for Sisyphus?
ThanatosAboutMegaera02|Thanatos About Megaera 02|Thanatos|We each had to blow off some steam, yes. That was some of the hardest I ever worked, back then, and her, too, I think. When you go through something like that with someone, it brings you closer, I suppose.
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01|Zagreus|Than, there's something that I meant to tell you. Ask you, rather. You're close with Megaera, so, what I mean is... you know about *us*, right?
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01|Thanatos|Yes, of course. Why do you ask?
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01|Zagreus|Well, it's just... I figured since you deal with mortals all the time, I know that some of them, they choose a single suitor. It's a valid custom, if it's yours...!
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01|Thanatos|The mortals have their customs, yes, indeed. Quite a variety, in point of fact. However, none as yet have stuck with me, I think. So don't concern yourself with things like that.
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01|Zagreus|You're saying you're not angry with me? Or Meg, for that matter?
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithMegaera01|Thanatos About Being Close With Megaera 01|Thanatos|Not any more than usual. Tell her that I said hello when next you meet.
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithDusa01|Thanatos About Being Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|Than, you don't take issue with me being close with Dusa, do you? She brings such warmth to this place... I really appreciate having her here.
ThanatosAboutBeingCloseWithDusa01|Thanatos About Being Close With Dusa 01|Thanatos|You don't need to ask me such things, Zagreus. They're your feelings.
ThanatosAboutAres01|Thanatos About Ares 01|Zagreus|Than, what's your relationship with Ares on Olympus? I know he deals in death himself, but... his approach seems rather different from your own.
ThanatosAboutAres01|Thanatos About Ares 01|Thanatos|I do not care for his approach at all. But he has been professionally courteous with me. More than I can say for most of your Olympian relatives, I suppose.
ThanatosAboutAres01|Thanatos About Ares 01|Zagreus|You mean the rest of the Olympians don't treat you well?
ThanatosAboutAres01|Thanatos About Ares 01|Thanatos|Discounting Hermes, I should say, the rest of them have nothing much to do with me at all. I can imagine why, I know it's complicated with your father here. But as for Ares... I think he's all right.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndAres01|Thanatos About Nyx And Ares 01|Zagreus|Than? I thought you ought to know that Ares, he... I think he's taken quite an interest in Nyx. Keeps asking me to talk to her on his behalf.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndAres01|Thanatos About Nyx And Ares 01|Thanatos|Finally. It's about time Olympus took notice of Mother and all her accomplishments.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndAres01|Thanatos About Nyx And Ares 01|Zagreus|Finally? You don't think Ares has untoward intentions or anything like that?
ThanatosAboutNyxAndAres01|Thanatos About Nyx And Ares 01|Thanatos|He'd be a hollow fool if he did. Why do you think they fear us on Olympus, Zagreus? Because of Hypnos? I don't think Mother Nyx requires your concern. Though, by all means, talk to her about it, if you like.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndChaos01|Thanatos About Nyx And Chaos 01|Thanatos|Mother Nyx told me you restored the Eldest Sigil, Zagreus. I couldn't believe that was your doing. What you did... it meant a lot to her.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndChaos01|Thanatos About Nyx And Chaos 01|Zagreus|It was my pleasure. Say, did Nyx ever let on to you of her relationship with Chaos, at any point?
ThanatosAboutNyxAndChaos01|Thanatos About Nyx And Chaos 01|Thanatos|No, not everyone is quite as sharing as you are, Zag. Nor as inclined to pry. But still... in this case, sounds like it worked out. So, thank you. If she hasn't said as much.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa01|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 01|Thanatos|I can tell when Mother Nyx is upset, Zagreus. And I know better than to ask her, so I'm going to ask you. What happened?
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa01|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 01|Zagreus|Probably because Nyx took issue with me chatting with Dusa from time to time. Is that really so unbecoming of me? Not even Father seems to care.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa01|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 01|Thanatos|Well, Mother cares! And I, for one, know better than to question it. None of us would be here were it not for her. If she has a request for you, you honor it.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa01|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 01|Zagreus|You're telling me I should just start ignoring Dusa from now on, like you do?
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa01|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 01|Thanatos|You're a god. I'm telling you to learn to act like one.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa02|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 02|Zagreus|I'm sorry I raised my voice with you last time, Than. I know Nyx puts so much into this place, and has nurtured so many of us here.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa02|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 02|Thanatos|It's not me you should be apologizing to, Zag. Although, with Mother Nyx, sometimes it's best to leave her be. As for Dusa... I didn't mean to suggest you should abandon your friend.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa03|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 03|Zagreus|Nyx let her go, Than. Dusa, I mean, she's gone. What do I do?
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa03|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 03|Thanatos|If I were you, I would start getting over it as soon as possible. But, I don't see you doing that. Just remember... maybe this isn't about you. Dusa's job may have been far too much for her. Mother Nyx is strict, but she is fair.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa03|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 03|Zagreus|Then she should give Dusa another chance. Has Meg heard? She'll be furious.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa03|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 03|Thanatos|Megaera will be no such thing. Some of us don't default to questioning every decision from our superiors.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa04|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 04|Thanatos|I saw that Dusa's back. You must have worked your ways on Mother Nyx. Don't know how you do it. Can't remember the last time I saw her budge on anything.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa04|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 04|Zagreus|Nyx genuinely cares about this House and all of us. She had to come around on something like this. Dusa's one of the hardest workers here. Even if she has room to improve.
ThanatosAboutNyxAndDusa04|Thanatos About Nyx And Dusa 04|Thanatos|Incessant hard work can lead to trouble, Zagreus. I think maybe that's why Mother was concerned. We all know how your father can get. She doesn't need someone like Dusa taking after him.
ThanatosAboutHypnos01|Thanatos About Hypnos 01|Zagreus|Than, you know, Hypnos, he adores you. Besides just driving you to madness, now and then.
ThanatosAboutHypnos01|Thanatos About Hypnos 01|Thanatos|I'm rather used to the relationship, thanks, Zagreus. Seems like you got to know him pretty well.
ThanatosAboutHypnos01|Thanatos About Hypnos 01|Zagreus|Well, dying repeatedly can end up bringing people closer, I suppose.
ThanatosAboutHypnos01|Thanatos About Hypnos 01|Thanatos|I don't know what's worse, dying repeatedly or Hypnos. Although, I guess I'm grateful for your patience with him, Zag.
ThanatosAboutHypnos02|Thanatos About Hypnos 02|Zagreus|Got to tell you something, Than. You can be pretty mean to Hypnos! And that's coming from someone who's mean to Hypnos a lot. Believe me, I completely understand, but... still.
ThanatosAboutHypnos02|Thanatos About Hypnos 02|Thanatos|He's utterly incompetent, Zag. He wouldn't even be here if Mother Nyx wasn't trying to whip him into some sort of shape.
ThanatosAboutHypnos02|Thanatos About Hypnos 02|Zagreus|Yeah, but... pretty much none of this would be here, were it not for Nyx, right? Anyway my point is not that you should go easy on him, but... there must be some way not to get as frustrated. You'll both be better off.
ThanatosAboutHypnos02|Thanatos About Hypnos 02|Thanatos|I know, it's just...! You're right. I catch myself feeling particularly horrid after talking to him. He can be very frustrating, and self-absorbed... though, I know he means well. Probably.
ThanatosAboutHypnos03|Thanatos About Hypnos 03|Zagreus|I can hardly believe it. Hypnos finally came out on top, huh? Even Father seemed pleased with him. That's more than I get.
ThanatosAboutHypnos03|Thanatos About Hypnos 03|Thanatos|I can hardly believe it either, Zagreus. But then again, he's one of Mother Nyx's offspring, so we shouldn't be so surprised. Though, I have to thank you for talking to me about him a while back...
ThanatosAboutHypnos03|Thanatos About Hypnos 03|Zagreus|Oh, that? I noticed you two getting along better recently. So what's your secret?
ThanatosAboutHypnos03|Thanatos About Hypnos 03|Thanatos|He loves lists. Doesn't do well with subtlety, so much, but spell things out for him, and he will get right on it. Long as he's awake, at least. He's still working on that part.
ThanatosAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|I saw you voided the old pact between Orpheus and your father. So now he gets to see his wife from time to time?
ThanatosAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|He does, and I did, Than. I think we can stand to see a little less of him if it means he can be happier for the remainder of eternity.
ThanatosAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|You really need to learn to stop meddling in others' affairs. Did either of them even ask your help? I can't imagine Orpheus did, and I'm guessing his wife's feelings were complicated, too, from what I know of the circumstances of their final meeting.
ThanatosAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|What? Orpheus is my mate, Than. And I came to know his muse, Eurydice, as well. They still had feelings for each other, but with no way to communicate.
ThanatosAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|So you decided to step in. *Tsch*. I think my instincts on the subject are just not the same as yours. I know your intentions were in the right place, but... you know what, forget it.
ThanatosAboutQuestLog01|Thanatos About Quest Log 01|Thanatos|I saw the Fated List of Minor Prophecies was requisitioned through the House Contractor, Zagreus. Didn't take you for an agent of the Fates.
ThanatosAboutQuestLog01|Thanatos About Quest Log 01|Zagreus|Turns out I'm full of surprises, Thanatos. Though, the Three Fates are your sisters, aren't they? Surprised you didn't requisition the List yourself.
ThanatosAboutQuestLog01|Thanatos About Quest Log 01|Thanatos|Guess it just wasn't meant to be. Though, I don't know them at all. Keep only to themselves, somewhere. Sometimes I wonder whether everything really is preordained, or whether they're making all this up as they go.
ThanatosRunCleared01|Thanatos Run Cleared 01|Thanatos|You took Lord Hades down... you really did. I've never seen him quite like this before. I could scarce believe it when he came up through the Pool of Styx, himself...
ThanatosRunCleared01|Thanatos Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|Seemed only fair in the grand scheme of things. He slew his own parents at some point, right? I think the Fates enjoy this sort of thing.
ThanatosRunCleared01|Thanatos Run Cleared 01|Thanatos|Come on, Zag, take some credit where it's due. Though... you'll forgive me if I keep my distance for a little while, as I think you have some issues to resolve. You watch yourself.
ThanatosAboutStaying01|Thanatos About Staying 01|Thanatos|...You're really staying, Zagreus? I mean... between the generally ill-conceived attempts to reach the surface every so often.
ThanatosAboutStaying01|Thanatos About Staying 01|Zagreus|I am. I figured it's the only way I could continue interrupting you while you try to do your job. You work too hard, Than, live a little, right?
ThanatosAboutStaying01|Thanatos About Staying 01|Thanatos|*Heh*. Well then, I'll see what I can do about that. You'll have to show me what you mean by *'live a little'*, though.
ThanatosAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Thanatos About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Have to tell you something, Than. My birthmother... she didn't abandon me. Or at least... she didn't think she did.
ThanatosAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Thanatos About Persephone Meeting 02|Thanatos|She didn't *think *she did? What are you talking about, Zag? She left when you were born. Was never seen or spoken of again, until all this with you.
ThanatosAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Thanatos About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Well, it turns out... she never knew I was alive, at all. Complications when I was born. She had been struggling already here, and it was all too much, I guess. By the time Nyx brought me back... my mother was long gone.
ThanatosAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Thanatos About Persephone Meeting 02|Thanatos|*What*? But, Mother Nyx, and your father, they... could have sent for her, let her know... they must have known where she went!
ThanatosAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Thanatos About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Nyx knew. But, Father must have convinced her that my mother... that it would be for the best if she never found out. About me. So she could live in peace. Away from all of this. And away from Olympus.
ThanatosAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Thanatos About Persephone Meeting 02|Thanatos|That's... a lot to take in.
ThanatosAboutRelationship01|Thanatos About Relationship 01|Thanatos|...Answer me something, Zagreus. What am I to you, exactly, as of late? Because, sometimes, with you, I...
ThanatosAboutRelationship01|Thanatos About Relationship 01|Zagreus|I'm sometimes at a loss myself, Thanatos. Though one thing I know is it's always really good running into you out there, it's... well, exciting. Sparring with you and all that! And then, I know it means that I might get to see you here.
ThanatosAboutRelationship01|Thanatos About Relationship 01|Thanatos|Well, here I am. But you didn't answer my question. Though, you know something? Forget I asked. I've got to go.
ThanatosAboutRelationship02|Thanatos About Relationship 02|Zagreus|Hey, Than, tell me something, and forgive the awkward question here, but... are we good? I mean... between us. Any infuriating habits I should know about, that sort of thing?
ThanatosAboutRelationship02|Thanatos About Relationship 02|Thanatos|You know I don't have time to list all your infuriating habits, Zagreus. Though... if any of them were outside my usual tolerance threshold, I promise to let you know, all right?
ThanatosAboutRelationship02|Thanatos About Relationship 02|Zagreus|So then, we're good. Because I think we're good, but I just wanted to make sure.
ThanatosAboutRelationship02|Thanatos About Relationship 02|Thanatos|We're good. See you, all right?
ThanatosAboutRelationship03|Thanatos About Relationship 03|Thanatos|...It just struck me how much you've changed, Zag. I still remember when you kept trying to singe Cerberus' tail with your feet. Haven't seen you do that in a while.
ThanatosAboutRelationship03|Thanatos About Relationship 03|Zagreus|Oh, I definitely learned my lesson there. But, thanks, I guess. You've opened up a lot, yourself, by the way. Talking to you lately, it's a world apart from the first time. You looked like you were going to slice my head off.
ThanatosAboutRelationship03|Thanatos About Relationship 03|Thanatos|It sure must have taken a lot of courage for you to come right up and tell me you thought I looked better before I cut my hair. I still ask myself how come I didn't keep ignoring you after that. Or slice your head off.
ThanatosAboutRelationship03|Thanatos About Relationship 03|Zagreus|Well, the option is always available, I guess. Hey, you ever think of growing it out again?
ThanatosAboutRelationship03|Thanatos About Relationship 03|Thanatos|No. It kept getting in my way. Sliced it right off and never looked back. So... plenty of personal growth all around, then?
ThanatosAfterPersephoneMeeting03|Thanatos After Persephone Meeting 03|Thanatos|How's everything been going with your mother, Zagreus? You've been pretty quiet about the whole thing, is everything all right? You can tell me.
ThanatosAfterPersephoneMeeting03|Thanatos After Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|Thank you for asking, Than. I don't know how much more I can say right now, given everything. I'm still figuring it out myself. I'm thankful you've been there to help me get to see her from time to time.
ThanatosAfterPersephoneMeeting03|Thanatos After Persephone Meeting 03|Thanatos|Well, if there's something more that I can do to support you in this, let me know, all right? Sounds like you're making progress, at least.
ThanatosPostEnding01|Thanatos Post Ending 01|Thanatos|So, between us... all your attempting to break out of here, over and over... you're now authorized to keep that up? Exposing weaknesses in Underworld security, huh.
ThanatosPostEnding01|Thanatos Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Something like that. I guess I've gotten pretty decent about escaping from a place that's known for being inescapable. Lets me keep in touch with the other side of the family. Work with you from time to time.
ThanatosPostEnding01|Thanatos Post Ending 01|Thanatos|I have to say I never thought I'd hear you talking about looking forward to working, Zag. You feeling all right? Spending too much time on the surface, maybe?
ThanatosPostEnding01|Thanatos Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Oh I'm feeling fine. I never thought I was much good at anything, but... if my fated purpose is to be a master of frustrating Father's efforts to make everything strictly perfect, I think I'm OK with that.
ThanatosPostEnding01|Thanatos Post Ending 01|Thanatos|Well, then, I'll be looking forward to working with you in a more official capacity. Even if we're still supposed to keep it all under wraps, for sake of appearances. See you out there.
ThanatosPostEnding02|Thanatos Post Ending 02|Thanatos|Have to tell you, Zag. It's different, with your mother around here. Don't mean to be so obvious, but... it's something about your father, I suppose.
ThanatosPostEnding02|Thanatos Post Ending 02|Zagreus|I think they have a lot of work ahead of them. As long as they're trying... he's trying... I think I'm good with that, for now. Though, I am glad she's here.
ThanatosPostEnding02|Thanatos Post Ending 02|Thanatos|I'm beginning to think we all are. And, please don't take this the wrong way, but... I think you and your father have a lot of work ahead of you, as well.
ThanatosPostEpilogue01|Thanatos Post Epilogue 01|Thanatos|Your mother's very clever, Zagreus. I always thought you got that from your father, now I'm not so sure. So all is well with the Olympians, again?
ThanatosPostEpilogue01|Thanatos Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|For now, I think it is. But, you know how they are. How we all are, I guess.
ThanatosPostEpilogue01|Thanatos Post Epilogue 01|Thanatos|*Hah*! Yes, indeed. Well, then! I guess enjoy it while it lasts, as mortals sometimes say. I'll see you out there.
ThanatosWithHades01|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (1)|Hades|Such tardiness is oft to be expected from your brother, but from you, Thanatos? You're practically the god of punctuality.
ThanatosWithHades01|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (1)|Thanatos|My lord, I apologize sincerely for the lapse in my performance as of late. I think my duties following the recent war above took more of a toll from me than I expected.
ThanatosWithHades01|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (1)|Hades|Thanatos, even we gods require rest from time to time. Someday we might get it around here, once this accursed House is well in order, finally. Until then, I appreciate your diligence. Do not overextend yourself.
ThanatosWithHades01|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (1)|Thanatos|Thank you, my lord. I am at your service. I'll be getting back to my assignment now.
ThanatosWithHades02|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (2)|Hades|...You have been rather slow about your duties, lately, Thanatos. And I'm receiving incident reports from Tartarus involving *you*. Remember your responsibilities. And, remember, *I am watching you*. Now, get out of my sight.
ThanatosWithHades03|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (3)|Hades|You've been abetting him, Thanatos. Behind my back! Betrayal. I would ask you *why*. Well?
ThanatosWithHades03|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (3)|Thanatos|My lord, he and I... please. Go lock me up in Tartarus, or deal whichever justice you see fit, but... my loyalty is not subject to change. And I cannot stand by and watch you fight. The matter between you and Zagreus... there has to be some resolution, here.
ThanatosWithHades03|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (3)|Hades|You dare to lecture me? *Tsch*. My loyal subjects are too few of late, I think. This is *your *realm, not mine; I'll not cast you into that wretched pit. It's not like I have someone to replace you here, besides. Now then, begone.
ThanatosWithHades03|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (3)|Thanatos|I'm deeply sorry, lord...
ThanatosWithHades04|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (4)|Thanatos|You wished to see me once again, my lord? It's been... a while since I had an audience with you.
ThanatosWithHades04|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (4)|Hades|It has. The last time, what was it you said? That there must be some resolution to the *matter*, as you called it, with my son? Well it is settled, now. Isn't it, boy?
ThanatosWithHades04|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (4)|Zagreus|I mean, you're still trying just as hard as ever to prevent me from escaping past the threshold of your realm, so, I don't know if I'd exactly call the matter *settled*. But... it does feel different, now.
ThanatosWithHades04|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (4)|Hades|And so you see... I would continue in our mutual good graces, if you please. This House can only function if the upper management is in accord. What do you say?
ThanatosWithHades04|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (4)|Thanatos|I say, you honor me, my lord. I appreciate you telling me, yourself. And I concur that, for the good of all the Underworld, it is imperative that each of us continue to perform at our full strength.
ThanatosWithHades04|Duo - Thanatos and Hades (4)|Hades|Then, as you were. Dismissed.
ThanatosWithHypnos01|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (1)|Thanatos|Hypnos, really, that is the worst idea I think I've ever heard. Do you understand how little sense that makes?
ThanatosWithHypnos01|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (1)|Hypnos|I'm just saying, maybe if you just, I don't know, had all the mortals die at the same time, it'd save you a bunch of trips, and then we'd have more time to spend together, huh?
ThanatosWithHypnos01|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (1)|Thanatos|I don't know why I bother with you, honestly. Get back to work, and let me do the same.
ThanatosWithHypnos02|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (2)|Thanatos|You cannot keep falling asleep on the job like this, Hypnos. This is completely unacceptable.
ThanatosWithHypnos02|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (2)|Hypnos|Oh I just nodded off a little while, Thanatos! I rest easy knowing that you're here! But if I goofed, why, I guess you could kill me dead, or something, huh?
ThanatosWithHypnos02|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (2)|Thanatos|Don't give me any ideas. Pull yourself together, and quit slacking off. The House needs help, and you've got a job to do. Now get to it!
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (3)|Thanatos|...Hypnos, this list has a bunch of tasks from I don't know how long ago, I mean... I took several of these last year! And you've already submitted this week's registrations, why isn't that marked complete?
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (3)|Hypnos|Don't you know it, I was just about to get to that! Then you showed up, and I got so distracted, it just kind of slipped my mind! It happens, right?
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (3)|Thanatos|You need to focus, Brother. Or it'll be Lord Hades reprimanding you again, and that is not something you want.
ThanatosWithHypnos03|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (3)|Hypnos|Oh, I don't know about that, last time I talked to Master he made *pretty clear *he never wanted to speak to me again!
ThanatosWithHypnos04|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (4)|Thanatos|Hypnos, you're not irreplaceable, you understand? If you don't shape up, quickly, someone else is going to have your job.
ThanatosWithHypnos04|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (4)|Hypnos|Oh I hear you loud and clear, Thanatos! And, let me tell you, they will have the *greatest job in all the Underworld*!
ThanatosWithHypnos04|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (4)|Thanatos|I feel like I'm not getting through to you, Brother. Well, after the inevitable happens, don't come telling me I didn't try.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (5)|Thanatos|...Well, how often do you consult these lists you make? If you're spending too much time just making lists, you're not leaving time to get anything done.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (5)|Hypnos|Oh, I *love *making my lists... I always illustrate the edges, each one is *unique*! That way anyone who gets to review the work, it's a whole *experience*, you know? But... I guess it does take up a lot of time.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (5)|Thanatos|You'll have to work around the constraints of your responsibilities. You do take breaks, don't you? Before and after each break, maybe that's a time to make sure your own list of priorities is up-to-date.
ThanatosWithHypnos05|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (5)|Hypnos|Wait, my own list of priorities...? But, you're saying I can just go and make a list... for me? Huh. Whoa. *Whoa*....
ThanatosWithHypnos06|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (6)|Thanatos|I've heard that your reports have been immaculate of late, Hypnos. I have to know, who's helping you with them? It can't be Zagreus.
ThanatosWithHypnos06|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (6)|Hypnos|Oh, *haha*, no, he doesn't help. It's just I took to listing only the important stuff up top, and spending just a bit more time on the priority reports, and... guess it's working out!
ThanatosWithHypnos06|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (6)|Thanatos|Look, whatever the case... the work's improved. It's been observed. You ought to keep it up.
ThanatosWithHypnos07|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (7)|Thanatos|...Though, what I mean to say is, that... I'm sorry, Hypnos. You're my brother, but I haven't always treated you that way. Would you be willing to forgive me?
ThanatosWithHypnos07|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (7)|Hypnos|Aww, come on, Thanatos, are you kidding me, right here? We're like two skeletons in a crypt! You're the best, and you're always looking out for me. Even when you're not around for what can seem like aeons at a time!
ThanatosWithHypnos07|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (7)|Thanatos|Well let's not get ahead of ourselves, here. We each have got important jobs to do. Isn't that right, Brother?
ThanatosWithHypnos08|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (8)|Thanatos|...Congratulations, Brother! I saw you finally made the board. You made us proud.
ThanatosWithHypnos08|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (8)|Hypnos|Sure did! That's something, huh? Though, sorry Thanatos, can't really chat right now, the shades are stacking up, there's greetings to be done, and sign-ins... lots of work to do, you know?
ThanatosWithHypnos08|Duo - Thanatos and Hypnos (8)|Thanatos|I definitely know the feeling. Well then, let's keep it up, the both of us, all right?
ThanatosWithNyx01|Duo - Thanatos and Nyx (1)|Thanatos|Mother, is there something I can do to help, with all of this? I spend too much time away from the House. Please, let me know.
ThanatosWithNyx01|Duo - Thanatos and Nyx (1)|Nyx|You are already doing what you can to help, my son. Continue doing so. Matters are at stake here concerning you and all of us. Your support and choices in this shape the outcome that shall come to pass.
ThanatosWithNyx01|Duo - Thanatos and Nyx (1)|Thanatos|I understand, and I will do my best. Thank you for taking care of everything. I've every faith in you, Mother. And in this House. Farewell.
ThanatosWithNyx02|Duo - Thanatos and Nyx (2)|Thanatos|Am I imagining it, Mother, or has this House been running relatively smoothly as of late? Although I know I must be tempting the Three Fates by putting it like this.
ThanatosWithNyx02|Duo - Thanatos and Nyx (2)|Nyx|It is through a concerted effort that the House thus thrives, for now. Though, it shall do so only through continued diligence on your behalf, and that of many others here. It is a good occasion to take brief reprieve. But we need you working to the best of your ability, here, Thanatos.
ThanatosWithNyx02|Duo - Thanatos and Nyx (2)|Thanatos|Well... know that I am ever-grateful, Mother. And I love you very much. Where would we be right now if not for you? I don't take what you've done for us for granted, nor does anybody here. You rest assured.
ThanatosWithMegaera01|Duo - Thanatos and Megaera (1)|Megaera|...But that was then and this is now, and we have work to do.... *Uh*, anyway, Than, I think we'd best continue this discussion at some other time.
ThanatosWithMegaera01|Duo - Thanatos and Megaera (1)|Thanatos|You're interrupting private conversation, Zagreus. Leave us.
ThanatosWithMegaera01|Duo - Thanatos and Megaera (1)|Megaera|No, let him stay, if that's what he wants. What does it matter? He's technically allowed within these halls, but he must know he isn't welcome anymore.
ThanatosWithPersephone01|Duo - Thanatos and Persephone (1)|Thanatos|Queen Persephone. All of us, we are most pleased you're back. If there is anything that I can do to ease your acclimation to this House, you need but ask.
ThanatosWithPersephone01|Duo - Thanatos and Persephone (1)|Persephone|Why, thank you, Thanatos! I'll take you up on that if I can think of anything anytime soon. But my, you've grown! I understand you've been looking after my son, in the meantime?
ThanatosWithPersephone01|Duo - Thanatos and Persephone (1)|Thanatos|Your son, he... is very capable of looking after himself, it turns out. Although I try to be there, just in case. Though, I must beg your pardon, Queen. Someone awaits me on the surface now.
ThanatosWithPersephone02|Duo - Thanatos and Persephone (2)|Thanatos|...I thank you for your blessings, Queen Persephone. Your son and I... we always were quite close, but through all this ordeal, we've become rather inseparable, I think.
ThanatosWithPersephone02|Duo - Thanatos and Persephone (2)|Persephone|Well, I can see that he has better taste than I do, Thanatos! I have a sense of how industrious you are. You just take care of yourself, please. And take care of each other, too, all right?
ThanatosWithPersephone02|Duo - Thanatos and Persephone (2)|Thanatos|As you will, Queen. I mean, all right.
ThanatosHomeChat01|Thanatos Home Chat 01|Thanatos|Sorry, Zagreus, I have to go. Lots of assignments as of late. Too bad I can't be everywhere at once.
ThanatosHomeChat02|Thanatos Home Chat 02|Thanatos|No use in making idle chat, right, Zagreus?
ThanatosHomeChat03|Thanatos Home Chat 03|Thanatos|I have a job to do, and you've no interest in remaining here. See you around out there.
ThanatosHomeChat04|Thanatos Home Chat 04|Thanatos|Don't bother, Zagreus. I was just leaving.
ThanatosHomeChat05|Thanatos Home Chat 05|Thanatos|I hope you've thought through all of this. For both our sakes.
ThanatosHomeChat06|Thanatos Home Chat 06|Thanatos|I can't keep bailing you out each time you get in over your head.
ThanatosHomeChat07|Thanatos Home Chat 07|Thanatos|I have to say it's quite a mess you've gotten yourself into, Zagreus.
ThanatosHomeChat08|Thanatos Home Chat 08|Thanatos|You better know what you're doing.
ThanatosHomeChat09|Thanatos Home Chat 09|Thanatos|You're wasting your time. Just go.
ThanatosHomeChat10|Thanatos Home Chat 10|Thanatos|Shouldn't you be back out there by now, getting yourself killed?
ThanatosHomeChat11|Thanatos Home Chat 11|Thanatos|You know how much trouble I am getting myself into here?
ThanatosHomeChat12|Thanatos Home Chat 12|Thanatos|There's nothing left for us to talk about.
ThanatosHomeChat13|Thanatos Home Chat 13|Thanatos|Don't talk to me. Just go.
ThanatosHomeChat14|Thanatos Home Chat 14|Thanatos|Excuse me, I've got work to do.
ThanatosHomeChat15|Thanatos Home Chat 15|Thanatos|Not now, I have to go.
ThanatosHomeChat16|Thanatos Home Chat 16|Thanatos|I don't know what you want from me.
ThanatosHomeChat17|Thanatos Home Chat 17|Thanatos|I have to get back to my responsibilities.
ThanatosHomeChat18|Thanatos Home Chat 18|Thanatos|You are in so much trouble.
ThanatosHomeChat19|Thanatos Home Chat 19|Thanatos|You watch yourself out there.
ThanatosHomeChat20|Thanatos Home Chat 20|Thanatos|Take care of yourself.
ThanatosHomeChat21|Thanatos Home Chat 21|Thanatos|I'll see you out there, I guess.
ThanatosHomeChat22|Thanatos Home Chat 22|Thanatos|I hope all this is worth it.
ThanatosHomeChat23|Thanatos Home Chat 23|Thanatos|We'll meet again out there.
ThanatosHomeChat24|Thanatos Home Chat 24|Thanatos|I hope you know what you're doing.
ThanatosHomeChat25|Thanatos Home Chat 25|Thanatos|Can't talk right now, I have to get to work.
ThanatosHomeChat26|Thanatos Home Chat 26|Thanatos|I need to get to work. I'll see you later.
ThanatosHomeChat27|Thanatos Home Chat 27|Thanatos|Your father's going to have my hide.
ThanatosHomeChat28|Thanatos Home Chat 28|Thanatos|I am in so much trouble, you have no idea...
ThanatosHomeChat29|Thanatos Home Chat 29|Thanatos|What have I gotten myself into, Zag...
ThanatosHomeMaxChat01|Thanatos Home Max Chat 01|Thanatos|Much as I would like to stay and chat, I'd better go.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat02|Thanatos Home Max Chat 02|Thanatos|Zag, I've got so many mortals on my plate right now...
ThanatosHomeMaxChat03|Thanatos Home Max Chat 03|Thanatos|See you out there soon enough, all right?
ThanatosHomeMaxChat04|Thanatos Home Max Chat 04|Thanatos|If you stay out too long, I'm going to track you down.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat05|Thanatos Home Max Chat 05|Thanatos|Sounds like we've both been keeping plenty busy as of late.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat06|Thanatos Home Max Chat 06|Thanatos|Now that you're here, I can finally head out.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat07|Thanatos Home Max Chat 07|Thanatos|We'll have to catch up more some other time.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat08|Thanatos Home Max Chat 08|Thanatos|Sorry Zag, I'm due to get a bunch of mortals now.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat09|Thanatos Home Max Chat 09|Thanatos|Excuse me, Zag, just got word that I'm needed back up top.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat10|Thanatos Home Max Chat 10|Thanatos|Hope your father's going to be all right with all of this.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat11|Thanatos Home Max Chat 11|Thanatos|We showed those wretches last time, didn't we.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat12|Thanatos Home Max Chat 12|Thanatos|Good running into you out there, and glad you made it out.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat13|Thanatos Home Max Chat 13|Thanatos|Impressive that you went the distance once again.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat14|Thanatos Home Max Chat 14|Thanatos|Was good having an opportunity to back you up out there.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat15|Thanatos Home Max Chat 15|Thanatos|I heard you did good work out there last time.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat16|Thanatos Home Max Chat 16|Thanatos|The shades are murmuring about your latest exploits, Zag.
ThanatosHomeMaxChat17|Thanatos Home Max Chat 17|Thanatos|Don't have a lot of time for catching up right now, here, Zag.
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat01|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 01|Thanatos|You're not in too much of a hurry, are you, Zag?
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat01|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 01|Thanatos|Well then... some mortal up there's lived a good, long life.
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat02|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 02|Thanatos|Mind if I practice my ability to shift short distances with someone else?
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat02|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 02|Thanatos|Well... I'd say that test was a success, wouldn't you?
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat03|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 03|Thanatos|I have to shift away from here, though if you'd care to join me...
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat03|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 03|Thanatos|Too bad I can't just shift you to the top, though this wasn't so bad.
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat04|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 04|Thanatos|Hey let's get out of here for just a bit, all right?
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat04|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 04|Thanatos|Whew. Thanks for the break, now back to it, I guess.
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat05|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 05|Thanatos|Was just about to go on break, if you would care to join me.
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat05|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 05|Thanatos|Good catching up. Take care of yourself, Zag.
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat06|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 06|Thanatos|I think you'd better head back to your quarters, Zagreus.
ThanatosHomeIntermissionChat06|Thanatos Home Intermission Chat 06|Thanatos|Mm. I'd best get back to my responsibilities for now.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera01|Duo - Chat and Megaera (1)|Megaera|This is a private chat, if you'll excuse us, Zag.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera01|Duo - Chat and Megaera (1)|Thanatos|We'll see you later out there, Zagreus.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera02|Duo - Chat and Megaera (2)|Thanatos|Just catching up on things with Megaera here, Zag.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera02|Duo - Chat and Megaera (2)|Megaera|We were just talking about you, Zagreus.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera03|Duo - Chat and Megaera (3)|Megaera|Well if it isn't our mutual friend.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera03|Duo - Chat and Megaera (3)|Thanatos|Enjoy the peace and quiet with us, Zag.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera04|Duo - Chat and Megaera (4)|Megaera|Just catching up with Thanatos, if you don't mind.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera04|Duo - Chat and Megaera (4)|Thanatos|Discussing work-related matters, Zagreus.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera05|Duo - Chat and Megaera (5)|Megaera|Look who it is, Than. Zagreus.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera05|Duo - Chat and Megaera (5)|Thanatos|We've been comparing notes about our latest tasks.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera06|Duo - Chat and Megaera (6)|Megaera|We're in the middle of a conversation, Zag.
ThanatosChatWithMegaera06|Duo - Chat and Megaera (6)|Thanatos|Catch up with you some other time, all right?
ThanatosChatWithHypnos01|Duo - Chat and Hypnos (1)|Thanatos|...Looks like you have everything under control. Nice work, Hypnos.
ThanatosChatWithHypnos02|Duo - Chat and Hypnos (2)|Thanatos|...Plenty of time for sleeping once your shift is over, right, Brother?
ThanatosChatWithHypnos03|Duo - Chat and Hypnos (3)|Thanatos|...Heard your latest reports were looking good, Hypnos. You keep it up.
ThanatosChatWithHypnos04|Duo - Chat and Hypnos (4)|Thanatos|...Anyway, good catching up, Hypnos.
ThanatosChatWithHypnos05|Duo - Chat and Hypnos (5)|Thanatos|...That's the last of the new registrations, but I should have more soon.
ThanatosChatWithHypnos06|Duo - Chat and Hypnos (6)|Thanatos|...All right, I'd better get going. Take care, Brother.
ThanatosChatWithNyx01|Duo - Chat and Nyx (1)|Nyx|...We have another task for you.
ThanatosChatWithNyx01|Duo - Chat and Nyx (1)|Thanatos|As you will, Mother. It will be done immediately, then.
ThanatosChatWithNyx02|Duo - Chat and Nyx (2)|Thanatos|...Understood, Mother. Commencing the assignment now.
ThanatosChatWithNyx03|Duo - Chat and Nyx (3)|Nyx|...Your expertise is needed once again.
ThanatosChatWithNyx03|Duo - Chat and Nyx (3)|Thanatos|Then, very well, Mother. I'll begin right away, and be back soon.
ThanatosChatWithNyx04|Duo - Chat and Nyx (4)|Thanatos|...I hear you, Mother, and obey. I will return when the task is complete.
ThanatosChatWithNyx05|Duo - Chat and Nyx (5)|Thanatos|Thank you for thinking of me for this task. I'll make it happen shortly.
ThanatosChatWithNyx06|Duo - Chat and Nyx (6)|Thanatos|...The task is clear to me, Mother. I go. Your will be done.
ThanatosChatWithHades01|Duo - Chat and Hades (1)|Thanatos|...It shall be as you say, my lord. I will report back soon.
ThanatosChatWithHades02|Duo - Chat and Hades (2)|Thanatos|...Yes, my lord. I will begin, and not return until the deed is done.
ThanatosChatWithHades03|Duo - Chat and Hades (3)|Thanatos|...If that is all, my lord, then I will make way for the surface now.
ThanatosChatWithHades04|Duo - Chat and Hades (4)|Thanatos|...I understand, my lord. I know where they are and soon shall bring them here.
ThanatosChatWithHades05|Duo - Chat and Hades (5)|Thanatos|...I do appreciate your faith in me, my lord. Begging your pardon, please.
ThanatosChatWithHades06|Duo - Chat and Hades (6)|Thanatos|...This matter will be dealt with promptly, lord. I expect to return shortly.
ThanatosGift01|Thanatos Gift 01|Zagreus|It isn't much, Than, but I got you something.
ThanatosGift01|Thanatos Gift 01|Thanatos|You want me to take that off your hands, fine. But you are taking this from me, and if anybody asks, we're even. Or, scratch that, don't tell anyone about this, understand?
ThanatosGift02|Thanatos Gift 02|Thanatos|What, really...? Come on, what is this, Zagreus. You think handing this to me makes up for everything you've put us through?
ThanatosGift02|Thanatos Gift 02|Zagreus|It's just something I found out there that I thought you might like, Than. Don't think anything of it.
ThanatosGift03|Thanatos Gift 03|Thanatos|Why bother with such empty gestures, Zag. You've said you're getting out of here; best focus on that and leave me be.
ThanatosGift03|Thanatos Gift 03|Zagreus|It's not an empty gesture, Than. Besides, if I wasn't trying to stay focused, I'd be drinking it myself.
ThanatosGift04|Thanatos Gift 04|Thanatos|You shouldn't be doing this, Zag. You picked sides, and things are not the same. A momentary stab at thoughtfulness can't fix something like that.
ThanatosGift04|Thanatos Gift 04|Zagreus|We've been through a lot, Than, and I think we'll be going through a lot more yet. Consider it a token of our kinship.
ThanatosGift04_B|Thanatos Gift 04 B|Thanatos|Don't know what you're expecting, giving this to me. If there's a catch here, I don't want to know.
ThanatosGift04_B|Thanatos Gift 04 B|Zagreus|We've been through a lot, Than, and I think we'll be going through a lot more yet. Consider it a token of our kinship.
ThanatosGift05|Thanatos Gift 05|Thanatos|What is it with the generosity lately...? Look I'll just stash this with the rest if you really don't have a better thing to do with it than dump it off on me.
ThanatosGift05|Thanatos Gift 05|Zagreus|Hey, that's an idea. One of these days or nights, we'll have enough of this stuff to throw a feast to make all of Olympus jealous.
ThanatosGift06|Thanatos Gift 06|Thanatos|You can't be serious. You're serious...? *Eh*, you know what, fine. I'll take this and we'll go about our business. Though I don't see why you bother.
ThanatosGift06|Thanatos Gift 06|Zagreus|Why I bother? Why, how else can I show you how I feel except by handing you these bottles from time to time?
ThanatosGift07_A|Thanatos Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Hey Than. For all the times you've bailed me out, and just, all the times you've been around for me... I thought I'd get you this. The real thing.
ThanatosGift07_A|Thanatos Gift 07 A|Thanatos|Ambrosia...! Zagreus, where did you even... don't you think this is a bit excessive?
ThanatosGift07_A|Thanatos Gift 07 A|Zagreus|You say that like it's a bad thing. Little bit of excess from time to time never hurt anyone I'm sure.
ThanatosGift07_A|Thanatos Gift 07 A|Thanatos|*Oh*, you would be surprised. Though if you're going to embarrass me, you know what, I am going to reciprocate. *Behold*!
ThanatosGift08|Thanatos Gift 08|Zagreus|For you, Thanatos. The Olympians might be accustomed to this stuff but I think we should have our share of it down here. At least you should.
ThanatosGift08|Thanatos Gift 08|Thanatos|You know... the Olympians do have good taste in certain things. The last bottle you gave me... it was... better than expected. Though, I almost decided not to try it at all.
ThanatosGift08|Thanatos Gift 08|Zagreus|But try it you did! And now, you'll get to try this one for comparison's sake. Each one's supposed to be different you know.
ThanatosGift08|Thanatos Gift 08|Thanatos|Different, huh. Well, then, I guess I'll have to see what you mean by that. Thank you, Zag. You didn't have to do this.
ThanatosGift09|Thanatos Gift 09|Zagreus|I hope you're ready for some more of the real thing, there, Than, because I got you some, and I won't be taking *'Tsch, what is this, Zag' *for an answer.
ThanatosGift09|Thanatos Gift 09|Thanatos|Ugh, what is this? Come on, already, Zagreus, are you just messing with me, now? How did you even manage to get more of this, much less decide to hand it off to me?
ThanatosGift09|Thanatos Gift 09|Zagreus|In order: no, I'm not; by ransacking my father's realm repeatedly; and it's because I like you, Thanatos. In case you still have some misgivings about that.
ThanatosGift09|Thanatos Gift 09|Thanatos|You *like *me, Zagreus...? I never thought, I... don't know why that sounds so strange, coming from you. Given everything that's happened as of late.
ThanatosGift09|Thanatos Gift 09|Zagreus|Yeah. Look, if you don't feel the same way about me at this point, I would rather know. Cease all these coy gift exchanges, and all that.
ThanatosGift09|Thanatos Gift 09|Thanatos|I never said anything like that! You know what, there's... a bunch of mortals I have to go fetch. Good-bye.
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Zagreus|Thanatos, I wanted to apologize for the last time I approached you with a bottle of the real thing, and give the whole exchange another shot. Would that be all right?
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Thanatos|*Hmph*! You're asking my consent to give me yet another lavish gift? Sure! Permission granted. Though, what makes you think that your approach this time is going to be any more successful than the last?
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Zagreus|I don't know that it will. I never really know exactly where I stand with you. But I know how I feel. And I'd rather be up front with you, even if it means risking our relationship, such as it is.
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Thanatos|Our relationship? It wasn't long ago you were prepared to throw it all away while making for the surface, if you don't recall. But now you're saying that you care for me, and... what, exactly, Zagreus?
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Zagreus|Yes, that's what I'm saying, Than. I should not have left the way I did, without letting you know. But when you found me, I... think that's when... that's when I knew. Or started to realize, you know?
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Thanatos|I... yes. I know, I think, because... when I heard you took off, the anger that I felt, it was... it wasn't something I expected. So... *ungh*. What do we do now?
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Zagreus|Maybe we ought to take our time? Unlike the real thing there, that's a commodity we have in good supply. Just know that, if you feel the way I do... you know where to find me. And if not... I'm grateful, anyway.
ThanatosGift10|Thanatos Gift 10|Thanatos|...I see. Well, then. The best that I can say for now is that... I'm grateful, too, for this. Take care of yourself, Zag.
ThanatosGift07|Thanatos Gift 07|Thanatos|I have to hand it to you, Zag, you're really putting in the work to get me to forgive you after all you've done. I'm honestly surprised.
ThanatosGift07|Thanatos Gift 07|Zagreus|Don't be. That feast of ours is really going to be something, Than.
ThanatosFirstAppearance|Thanatos First Appearance|Thanatos|...Thought you could just get away from me, did you?
ThanatosFirstAppearance|Thanatos First Appearance|Zagreus|Thanatos. I figured it was only a matter of time before Father sent you after me to do his dirty work.
ThanatosFirstAppearance|Thanatos First Appearance|Thanatos|Zagreus. Is that really why you think I'm here? Let's see how many of these exalted champions you can send back to their dooms, unless you'd rather I would send you back to yours.
ThanatosFieldAboutHermes01|Thanatos Field About Hermes 01|Thanatos|Barely caught up with you, here, Zag. You must have had a little help from Hermes, I suppose.
ThanatosFieldAboutKeepsake01|Thanatos Field About Keepsake 01|Thanatos|You have the butterfly I gave to you. Stay back, then, and it'll make you stronger once I'm finished here.
ThanatosFieldAboutLegendary02|Thanatos Field About Legendary 02|Thanatos|Got little Mort with you, there, huh. Well, there's no need to summon me this time.
ThanatosFieldRunCleared01|Thanatos Field Run Cleared 01|Thanatos|You're back. I thought you made it out. No matter.
ThanatosFieldPostEnding01|Thanatos Field Post Ending 01|Thanatos|Good to be working with you in a more official capacity, Zag. Shall we get started?
ThanatosMiscIntro01|Thanatos Misc Intro 01|Thanatos|Thought I might find you all the way out here. Although, quite frankly, I'm surprised you're still alive.
ThanatosMiscIntro01|Thanatos Misc Intro 01|Zagreus|I can hold my own in case you haven't noticed, Than.
ThanatosMiscIntro01|Thanatos Misc Intro 01|Thanatos|I haven't, Zag! Now, stand back, and let me show you how it's done.
ThanatosMiscIntro02|Thanatos Misc Intro 02|Thanatos|Still at it, I see. You're stubborn. And you are going to get me in a heap of trouble before all is said and done.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable01|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 01|Thanatos|How about another of our little contests, Zagreus?
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable02|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 02|Thanatos|We'll have to catch up at some other time. Though good to see you anyway.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable03|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 03|Thanatos|I have a feeling this is not going to take much time at all.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable04|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 04|Thanatos|I only have a little time until my next assignment, but this shouldn't take too long.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable05|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 05|Thanatos|Thought I might stop by and check up on this corner of the Underworld, Zag.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable06|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 06|Thanatos|You've come this far, now let's make sure you go the distance, Zag.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable07|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 07|Thanatos|I heard there was a matter that required my attention here.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable08|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 08|Thanatos|Had a feeling I would find you all alone out here.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable09|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 09|Thanatos|Want to stand back and watch me work, here, Zag?
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable10|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 10|Thanatos|This one is off the record, Zagreus. Come on!
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable11|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 11|Thanatos|Looks like we've got an urgent work-related matter to attend to.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable12|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 12|Thanatos|Your father's forces making trouble for you, Zag?
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable13|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 13|Thanatos|Not a word of this to anyone back home, you hear me, Zagreus?
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable14|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 14|Thanatos|I heard you got yourself into another mess that needed cleaning up.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable15|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 15|Thanatos|We'll catch up later, now let's deal with these wretches and be done.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable16|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 16|Thanatos|Hope you don't mind if I cut in, here, Zagreus.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable17|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 17|Thanatos|What say we go take care of business here just like we used to, Zag?
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable18|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 18|Thanatos|I can't stay long, so how about we get this business over with.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable19|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 19|Thanatos|Figured you'd be up to have another of our little contests. Now let's go.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable20|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 20|Thanatos|What do you say we deal some death together, Zagreus?
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable21|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 21|Thanatos|Don't have much time, but let me see if I can pitch in.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable22|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 22|Thanatos|Remember, not a word of this, to anyone. Let's go.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable23|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 23|Thanatos|You look like you could use a hand.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable24|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 24|Thanatos|Let's see who's better at this, Zagreus.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable25|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 25|Thanatos|I got the feeling you could use some backup here.
ThanatosMiscStartRepeatable26|Thanatos Misc Start Repeatable 26|Thanatos|Let's get this done.
ThanatosMiscStart14|Thanatos Misc Start 14|Thanatos|Good, I'm not too late. Got here as quickly as I could.
ThanatosMiscStart15|Thanatos Misc Start 15|Thanatos|I got the message that you need assistance, Zagreus?
ThanatosFieldFirstMeeting|Thanatos Field First Meeting|Thanatos|You left, without so much as telling me good-bye. I suppose you knew I'd catch up with you sooner or later, is that it? No escaping death, and all?
ThanatosFieldFirstMeeting|Thanatos Field First Meeting|Zagreus|I left when it was necessary, Than. I thought of you and hoped you'd understand. I have to do this.
ThanatosFieldFirstMeeting|Thanatos Field First Meeting|Thanatos|That's more motivation than I've ever heard from you. Well, if you won't say it, I'll say it. Good-bye, Zagreus.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting01|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 01|Thanatos|I've got to hand it to you, Zag. You're easy to track down. The shades of Tartarus are beginning to fear you even more than your Lord Father.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting01|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|Oh they won't fear me once they get to know me.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting01|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 01|Thanatos|I'm not so sure about that. Even I'm beginning to fear you, I think. Seems I don't know you as well as I thought.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting02|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 02|Thanatos|What's with the look? You had your hands full, now you don't thanks to me... *Tsch*, seems I'm left to thanking myself, since you're too proud to do it.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting03|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 03|Thanatos|You seemed a little winded, there, no? Not even close to the surface, yet, either.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting03|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 03|Zagreus|Thanks for the vote of confidence there, Than.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting03|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 03|Thanatos|You're very welcome. Now, I'd better get back, before Lord Hades catches on to this.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting05|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|I told you I don't need your help here, Thanatos.
ThanatosFieldMiscMeeting05|Thanatos Field Misc Meeting 05|Thanatos|It wasn't being offered. Just happened to be in the area is all. Carry on, Zagreus.
ThanatosFieldBackstory01|Thanatos Field Backstory 01|Thanatos|Still running from yourself, I see. How's that been working out for you thus far?
ThanatosFieldBackstory01|Thanatos Field Backstory 01|Zagreus|I'm searching for my mother. You still live at home with yours. You don't know what it's like.
ThanatosFieldBackstory01|Thanatos Field Backstory 01|Thanatos|Mother Nyx was like a mother to you, too. And this is how you repay her. You should be ashamed of yourself, and learn your place.
ThanatosFieldBackstory02|Thanatos Field Backstory 02|Thanatos|Listen to me. I don't know how else to put this, but, I want you to come home. Voluntarily. It's not just you swept up in all this nonsense now. And, I know you didn't ask for me to get involved, but, what did you expect?
ThanatosFieldBackstory02|Thanatos Field Backstory 02|Zagreus|...Than. Home is never going to be the same for me. There's no use trying to pretend. I have to go.
ThanatosFieldBackstory02|Thanatos Field Backstory 02|Thanatos|You don't *have *to do anything of the sort. You have no idea how good you've had it here. Maybe someday you'll come to understand.
ThanatosFieldBuildingTrust01|Thanatos Field Building Trust 01|Thanatos|Outdid me once again, there, huh. *Tsch*. I have to admit, you're not as bad at all of this as I expected. First I found you, I was certain that you had no chance at all.
ThanatosFieldBuildingTrust01|Thanatos Field Building Trust 01|Zagreus|I seem to have this whole easy-to-underestimate thing about me, based on a decent sum of my relationships. In any case, I always welcome your appearances out here. I know it's not been easy for you, Than.
ThanatosFieldBuildingTrust01|Thanatos Field Building Trust 01|Thanatos|That's fair as an assessment, I would say. But then again, it's never been an easy time for me. I know I have to do my job. But I don't have to keep on helping you, like this.
ThanatosFieldBuildingTrust01|Thanatos Field Building Trust 01|Zagreus|...What, you're telling me this is it? You're just going to leave me to my own devices, then, I've proved myself to you, something like that?
ThanatosFieldBuildingTrust01|Thanatos Field Building Trust 01|Thanatos|No, you deadbeat, I am telling you the opposite! Why do you think I keep on showing up? You may not really need me, Zagreus, but I will take these opportunities to help. I take it that's all right.
ThanatosFieldAboutLegendary01|Thanatos Field About Legendary 01|Thanatos|Good to see you taking little Mort there on one of your strolls. Means I can better keep an eye on you out there.
ThanatosFieldAboutLegendary01|Thanatos Field About Legendary 01|Zagreus|He's been great to have around, for sure. Still can't believe you found him after all this time! You used to always carry him around, I was so sad for you when he got lost.
ThanatosFieldAboutLegendary01|Thanatos Field About Legendary 01|Thanatos|And I cannot believe you still remember that. Regardless, he will not be getting lost again under your supervision, accurate?
ThanatosFieldAboutRelationship01|Thanatos Field About Relationship 01|Zagreus|About when we last spoke. I care about you, Thanatos. A lot. Though, you asked what you are to me... how am I supposed to even answer that?
ThanatosFieldAboutRelationship01|Thanatos Field About Relationship 01|Thanatos|*Ugh*, I don't know. Sometimes I miss not feeling anything. Can't always trust what feelings say. I get to thinking, are we only friends, or... look, this is embarrassing.
ThanatosFieldAboutRelationship01|Thanatos Field About Relationship 01|Zagreus|To think discussing feelings would be even harder than annihilating Father's forces. But... I've been asking myself the same thing, Than. If it's any reassurance.
ThanatosFieldAboutRelationship01|Thanatos Field About Relationship 01|Thanatos|Well, if you come up with any answers, I guess let me know. Good running into you.
ThanatosFieldAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos Field About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|Hey. I didn't mean to lay the guilt on you for what you did for Orpheus, Zag. I just worry when we get involved... we can make matters worse.
ThanatosFieldAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos Field About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|You haven't ever made anything worse, Than. But as for me, I realized what you meant. I was so eager to do something for Orpheus when I first met Eurydice, I... never asked them if it was OK.
ThanatosFieldAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Thanatos Field About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Thanatos|At least things turned out well for them. But that was fortunate. Family troubles, personal relations, and the like... it's sensitive business. Though, who am I to talk. You didn't ask me to show up, like this.
ThanatosFieldBecameCloseBackOffAftermath01|Thanatos Field Became Close Back Off Aftermath 01|Zagreus|Hey, Than, are you OK? I mean, with everything, lately?
ThanatosFieldBecameCloseBackOffAftermath01|Thanatos Field Became Close Back Off Aftermath 01|Thanatos|I am. Though, thanks for asking, Zag. The risk of being close with anyone is sometimes things get complicated, fast. Admittedly it's not a risk I often take, but... in your case, it's been worth it, all in all. We're good, all right?
ThanatosFieldAboutPersephoneFirstMeeting01|Thanatos Field About Persephone First Meeting 01|Thanatos|What are you doing back here, Zag? You made it out.
ThanatosFieldAboutPersephoneFirstMeeting01|Thanatos Field About Persephone First Meeting 01|Zagreus|I did... but I had to come back. And, not exactly voluntarily. I'll be visiting up there from time to time, though... it looks like I'll be staying here.
ThanatosFieldAboutPersephoneFirstMeeting01|Thanatos Field About Persephone First Meeting 01|Thanatos|Visiting from time to time...? I don't understand.
ThanatosFieldAboutPersephoneFirstMeeting01|Thanatos Field About Persephone First Meeting 01|Zagreus|It's my mother. She's alive and well! It's just that I can't stay with her up there for very long! So we'll have to catch up... one visit at a time.
ThanatosFieldAboutPersephoneFirstMeeting01|Thanatos Field About Persephone First Meeting 01|Thanatos|I see. Well then... that's good. That's good, because... it means that I won't have to track you down up top. Because, between us, I can only take so much of it up there.
DusaFirstMeeting|Dusa First Meeting|Dusa|*Oh*! The Prince himself, you, want to talk to me...? Me?! Oh, wow, *oh wow!!*
DusaFirstMeeting|Dusa First Meeting|Zagreus|I, *uh*, just wanted to say, the lounge looks wonderful, as good as new. Better! Hope it's not been too much trouble patching up.
DusaFirstMeeting|Dusa First Meeting|Dusa|I, I, I, *aah*, I have to clean the rafters, I...!
DusaFirstMeeting_Alt|Dusa First Meeting Alt|Dusa|*Oh*! The Prince himself, you, want to talk to me...? Me?! Oh, wow, *oh wow!!*
DusaFirstMeeting_Alt|Dusa First Meeting Alt|Zagreus|I, *uh*, just wanted to say, don't bother picking up my room today. I'm headed out for a while.
DusaFirstMeeting_Alt|Dusa First Meeting Alt|Dusa|I, I, I, *aah*, I have to clean the rafters, I...!
DusaMiscMeeting02|Dusa Misc Meeting 02|Dusa|I, *ah*, hope you're having a nice stay! Even though you don't want to live here anymore, Your Highness!
DusaMiscMeeting02Extra|Dusa Misc Meeting 02 Extra|Zagreus|*Erm*, Dusa? Turns out that I may be stopping back from time to time, like this. But, please don't bother picking up my room. I won't be staying long.
DusaMiscMeeting02Extra|Dusa Misc Meeting 02 Extra|Dusa|Oh, *hahaha*, sure! But I'll just keep an eye on things in there, from time to time, in case you change your mind, um, so, good-bye!
DusaMiscMeeting03|Dusa Misc Meeting 03|Dusa|*Um*, Prince? Your father, I, I think he's pretty steamed right now, about something, so, maybe you could stay away from him? Or... I could tell him you're not here?
DusaMiscMeeting03|Dusa Misc Meeting 03|Zagreus|That's quite all right, Dusa. I'm not afraid of him, and neither should you be. You're the best help he's ever found.
DusaMiscMeeting03|Dusa Misc Meeting 03|Dusa|Just, *ah*, just doing my job, here, Prince...!
DusaMiscMeeting04|Dusa Misc Meeting 04|Dusa|Oh, *um*, so, hi Prince! So, is there anything I can get you, or maybe tidy up some more, or... I just thought maybe you'd like something to drink? Sometime?
DusaMiscMeeting04|Dusa Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|*Oh*! A drink sometime sounds wonderful, Dusa, maybe tomorrow assuming I'm not getting out of here by then...?
DusaMiscMeeting04|Dusa Misc Meeting 04|Dusa|*Whaa*, I mean, it's no big deal, I mean, forget I asked, or anything, I'm sorry, bye!
DusaMiscMeeting05|Dusa Misc Meeting 05|Dusa|Uh, *um*, I just, wanted to apologize, because, I think maybe I didn't act very appropriately last time you spoke to me? But I just really, really like this job, and promise I will always do my very best, so, I just hope I'll have another chance?
DusaMiscMeeting05|Dusa Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|Dusa, please, there's no need to apologize! You've been doing a wonderful job, really!
DusaMiscMeeting05|Dusa Misc Meeting 05|Dusa|I... *what*? You really mean it, Prince, I... thank you, thanks so much!!
DusaPostFlashback01|Dusa Post Flashback 01|Dusa|Oh, *um*, hi, Your Highness? I, just wanted you to know, that if you do get out, I, we are going to miss you. Around here. OK? So, bye...!
DusaDate01|Dusa Date 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Ms. Dusa, I wanted to, *uh*, cordially invite you to an outing in the lounge? Remember when you asked me about a drink?
DusaDate01|Dusa Date 01|Dusa|*Aaah! *Oh, oh, oh, really, what you mean, right now, you're... I... I guess I'm overdue to take a break...
DusaDate01|Dusa Date 01|Dusa|...And, well, since I don't exactly fit the mold of your traditional gorgon, I mean, I have no body for example, I had trouble finding work! That is until Lord Hades took me in, and then, I met you, and, well, I just love this job!!
DusaDate01|Dusa Date 01|Zagreus|*Oh*! I can definitely relate at least to some of that.
DusaDate01|Dusa Date 01|Dusa|*<Sigh> *I, I, I, thanks, Your Highness. Prince. Prince Zagreus!
DusaDateAftermath01|Dusa Date Aftermath 01|Dusa|*Um*, P-Prince, the way you look so sad sometimes, when you come back in here, out of the Pool of Styx? Is everything OK? Because if there was something I could do...
DusaDateAftermath01|Dusa Date Aftermath 01|Zagreus|Oh, it's nothing for you to be concerned about, Dusa. I'm just having a harder time fighting my blasted way out of this place than I anticipated. If you'll excuse my language.
DusaDateAftermath01|Dusa Date Aftermath 01|Dusa|*Oh*, I... this is silly, but, I'd no idea anybody could beat *you*, I mean, the Prince? Greater than the mighty Achilles, more cunning than his father, faster than Hermes! But... you're just struggling, like me?
DusaDateAftermath01|Dusa Date Aftermath 01|Zagreus|I am. And that stuff you heard about me isn't true.
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest01|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 01|Dusa|...sorted the cutlery, wiped the counters, replaced the candles, did the dishes, swept the floor, inspected the barrels, let's see what else, *oh*!! The Prince, it's you!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest01|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 01|Zagreus|It's me! Dusa, I'm impressed you're able to manage this whole lounge all by yourself. How do you do it, what's your secret?
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest01|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 01|Dusa|*Hahaha*, secret? I'm two weeks behind schedule with this place, at least! Fortunately, no one here seems very good at keeping time, so, no one's gotten on my case just yet, but... oh, you aren't going to tell, are you?
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest01|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 01|Zagreus|Of course not. What's behind schedule, though? This place doesn't seem any worse for wear than usual.
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest01|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 01|Dusa|Well, that's just it! Miss Nyx, she tasked me with a pretty big project a while back, to make this place *worthy of the name*, which means... there's so much left to do, I need to get everything ready, please, excuse me, Prince!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02|Dusa|...patch up the seating, update the menu, clean the stove, stock the honor bar, sweep the rug, dust the rafters, mop the flooring, pay the broker, oh!! Um, sorry, Prince, way behind on my assignment, so if you'll excuse me, please...?
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02|Zagreus|Dusa, wait, before you fly away... there must be something I can do, to help pitch in with everything? Doesn't matter how good you are at your job, what you're describing, that's more than one individual can handle!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02|Dusa|Your Highness, please! I know you mean well, but I have this! Wish everybody wouldn't doubt me all the time, like that House Contractor, just gets to stand around, waiting for work orders! Unless they come from me, then *nooo*.
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02|Zagreus|The House Contractor isn't cooperating with you, huh. No wonder so many lounge renovations are clogged up in the works. Though maybe I can grease the wheels a bit?
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02|Dusa|*AAH*, I completely forgot!! I need to get more cooking grease for the Head Chef! I have to go!!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02_Alt|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02 Alt|Dusa|...patch up the seating, update the menu, clean the stove, stock the honor bar, sweep the rug, dust the rafters, mop the flooring, pay the broker, oh!! Um, sorry, Prince, way behind on my assignment, so if you'd excuse me, please...?
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02_Alt|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02 Alt|Zagreus|Dusa, wait, before you fly away... there must be something I can do, to help pitch in with everything? Doesn't matter how good you are at your job, what you're describing, that's more than one individual can handle!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02_Alt|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02 Alt|Dusa|Your Highness, please! I know you mean well, but I have this! Wish everybody wouldn't doubt me all the time, like that House Contractor, just gets to stand around, waiting for work orders! Unless they come from me, then *nooo*.
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02_Alt|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02 Alt|Zagreus|*Ooh*, that might be my fault. I've been giving the Contractor lots of work. Some of those lounge orders must be coming from you, right? This place is really shaping up!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest02_Alt|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 02 Alt|Dusa|*Wha-wha*, wait, then you're the one who's been authorizing all these improvements?! Oh my, oh my, *aaaah*!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest03|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 03|Zagreus|The lounge is really starting to look nice lately, Dusa! All your hard work is really paying off!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuest03|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest 03|Dusa|*Hah*! Why, thank you, Prince, it's just that, lately, the House Contractor's been slightly more agreeable I guess, working a little faster, maybe, but there's still a lot we have to do, so, you just wait!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuestComplete|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest Complete|Dusa|*Um*, Prince Zagreus...? I just wanted to say something, if you have a little time? I know you're really busy... I can come back.
DusaLoungeRenovationQuestComplete|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest Complete|Zagreus|Wait, no, now's fine, of course, what is it, Dusa? I'm not so busy, by the way, and always happy to check in. Wait, is something wrong?
DusaLoungeRenovationQuestComplete|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest Complete|Dusa|No, *nononono*, it is just the opposite, I... can't believe you helped me, with the lounge. I don't think *anyone *has *ever *helped me out like you did, cleaning up after Cerberus, and the new rug, and the kitchen, and, just, all of this!
DusaLoungeRenovationQuestComplete|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest Complete|Zagreus|It was my pleasure, really. All of us use the lounge, don't we? This House can really be a lot, but in the lounge here, things are easier a bit, I think. I'm so glad we have you watching over it.
DusaLoungeRenovationQuestComplete|Dusa Lounge Renovation Quest Complete|Dusa|Y, you really mean that, Prince...? But you don't know what this means to me. I'm finally caught up on work! W, what am I going to do? I, I don't know what I'm going to do with all this extra time! I have to go, and plan everything out!!
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|*Um*, Zagreus? I wanted to talk some more, if you're available? I mean, if you're free. I mean! If you have time to right now. Is that OK?
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|Of course, Dusa! Where should we chat? The lounge, or maybe somewhere more private...?
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|Somewhere more private, please, if that's OK? Thank you.
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|...Um, Zagreus... so, ever since you told me you had feelings for me, it's been, like... my whole mind is on fire. I haven't been able to think straight, or get anything done. It's all been so much!
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|I'm sorry, Dusa, I... put a lot on you, and... maybe I shouldn't have, since I'm the Prince and everything, as you point out, and... sometimes, I forget myself. I'd never pressure you, it's just... I thought you had these feelings for me, too.
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|I *do *have feelings for you, silly! That's what I've been trying to tell you, it's just... it's just...
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|It's just what...? Whatever it is, it's OK. You can be yourself with me, Dusa, I promise.
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|I'm glad you put it that way. I... I'm not looking for an intimate relationship. You're the kindest soul in this whole House. And I have learned so much from you! But, when I really think about my feelings... I'm just, not attracted to you, in that way. I'm sorry. You're a really nice guy!
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|Oh, *hahaha*, look, there's nothing to apologize for, not at all. In fact... all this is a relief. I've learned a lot from you, too, and I cherish our friendship for what it is. Do you... do you think that we could still be friends? Or, is it better that you didn't see me anymore...?
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|Don't say *that*! Though, I was going to ask you the same thing. I'd really like it if you'd be my friend! Though, my career comes first, so... I don't want you doing any special favors, promise me? I need to see how far I can get on my own.
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Zagreus|I respect that so much, and yes, I promise, Dusa. So, well, then... friends? For all eternity?
BecameCloseWithDusa01|Became Close With Dusa 01|Dusa|Yes. Friends. For all eternity. Now... I had better go. See you, OK?
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath01|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 01|Dusa|Hey, Zagreus, I... wanted to talk to you again, I... what I mean is, I just, hope I didn't hurt your feelings, because, if I did, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath01|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 01|Zagreus|Dusa, please! Remember *friends for all eternity*? That's a long time, so, there's no need for second guessing. I'm glad we had a chance to talk.
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath01|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 01|Dusa|Oh, well, good! That's a relief to hear, but... one last thing, so I can clear my conscience of it, I... I've saved all the Ambrosia that you gave me, and I figured since... I didn't realize, you know, the way you felt? I can be a little dense! I have it here. And I would like to give it back. Is that OK?
OrpheusMiscMeeting03|Orpheus Misc Meeting 03|Orpheus|Oh, hello Zagreus. You look a little down. And so I was just wondering, would you perchance fancy a song right now?
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath02|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 02|Dusa|Hey, *um*, Zagreus? I wanted to say, that was very sweet of you, letting me hang onto all that Ambrosia you gave me before? It's in safe keeping now! Except one bottle... that kind of slipped, and broke. Though that did mean I got to try the stuff!
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath02|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 02|Zagreus|Oh, you got to try it, after all? What did you think, all it's cracked up to be?
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath02|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 02|Dusa|It was a*maz*ing. I've never had anything like it! It's so good to have a forked tongue, meant I could taste it twice at the same time! So, um... if one of the other bottles slipped and broke... you wouldn't mind, would you?
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath03|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 03|Zagreus|Dusa, I can't shake this feeling, so I wanted to apologize to you, because... I think when we first met, I just... I don't think I took it the right way. I never had a fan before! I wanted to live up to your idea of me.
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath03|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 03|Dusa|Oh, Prince, Zagreus, don't worry about that! Even I didn't know what I was going through. When I first started working here, I was just *so *impressed with you, I mean... you were the only one who would stand up to your father! I thought about you all the time!
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath03|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 03|Zagreus|But you didn't even know me, yet. We didn't get to talking for what seemed like ages. You can be difficult to find! Since I can't fly up to the rafters like you can.
BecameCloseWithDusaAftermath03|Became Close With Dusa Aftermath 03|Dusa|Well I'm so glad you kept trying to talk to me! If you hadn't... I'd probably be up in the rafters still, building up this idea of you that's not even as good as the real thing!
DusaAboutLove01|Dusa About Love 01|Zagreus|Hey Dusa, something I was wondering, and it's just curiosity, mind you, but... is there somebody else...? I mean, somebody special, whom you're close with, or would like to be. Romantically, I mean. If it's all right to ask.
DusaAboutLove01|Dusa About Love 01|Dusa|Oh, you can ask me anything! But, *um*, somebody else romantically, not really, no? It's not really my thing? It doesn't mean I don't have feelings for you, though! You know that, right? I wouldn't drop what I'm doing and throw myself at danger for just anyone, you know!
DusaAboutLove01|Dusa About Love 01|Zagreus|I definitely know. There's seven kinds of love, or so, isn't that right? It isn't something that's taught extensively down here, though, so... there's still a lot for me to learn, I guess.
DusaAboutLove01|Dusa About Love 01|Dusa|Wow, I never thought of it as *love *until you said it there just now, Prince, but you're right! I love you, Zagreus! *Hah, haha*, that feels good to come right out and say, you know? OK, well, bye!
DusaAboutCerberus01|Dusa About Cerberus 01|Zagreus|I hope it's not been too much, having to care for Cerberus, is it, Dusa? He isn't quite as fearsome as he seems. At least, that goes for two heads out of three!
DusaAboutCerberus01|Dusa About Cerberus 01|Dusa|Oh, Cerberus is a good boy, he's fine! One of the highlights of the job, for sure. We really hit it off after he finally realized I'm not a ball! So, I've been feeding him, grooming him, changing his water dish...
DusaAboutCerberus01|Dusa About Cerberus 01|Zagreus|...Cleaning up after him...?
DusaAboutCerberus01|Dusa About Cerberus 01|Dusa|Most definitely, yes. If you'll excuse me, by the way? He's got to go. I mean! I've got to go! I mean!! You know what I mean, bye!
DusaAboutPressure01|Dusa About Pressure 01|Zagreus|*Ungh*, Dusa... it's a little much out there sometimes, I have to say. Different stresses than in here, but still.
DusaAboutPressure01|Dusa About Pressure 01|Dusa|Oh don't you lose hope now, Prince Zagreus! There isn't anything you couldn't handle, I just know! You're every bit as tough as your father, except, you're nice! And you never back down from anything. You can do this!
DusaAboutPressure01|Dusa About Pressure 01|Zagreus|...I don't know that anyone can do this. No escape from the Underworld and all that. Though, thanks for cheering me up.
DusaAboutPressure01|Dusa About Pressure 01|Dusa|I'm not just saying it, I mean it, Prince! Look at how far you've come! Practically everybody in this House believes in you! Even the Wretched Broker and the Head Chef! Oh, I've asked them! Everybody thinks you're going to succeed!
DusaAboutPressure02|Dusa About Pressure 02|Zagreus|Can I ask you a couple of purely figurative questions here, Dusa? First, what have I gotten myself into...? And second, what am I going to do...?
DusaAboutPressure02|Dusa About Pressure 02|Dusa|Believe me, I know the feeling, being in over my head! Though, if I can find my way out of my messes, then I know, I *know*, you definitely can! I don't know what you ought to do, but I am always here to listen.
DusaAboutAchilles01|Dusa About Achilles 01|Zagreus|You know Achilles reasonably well, don't you, Dusa? Seems like he's always stuck there in that hall. At least you get to fly around. Sometimes I think he wishes he was someplace else.
DusaAboutAchilles01|Dusa About Achilles 01|Dusa|There has to be a way to help him, Prince! He's been so loyal to this House, and he has to be your truest friend of everybody here. But he's the pity-party type. He needs someone to get him out of this!
DusaAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Dusa About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Dusa|Oh, Prince, I heard the news about Master Achilles, that's so great! I'm going to miss him being here as often as he used to, but I'm just so happy for him, and for you!
DusaAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Dusa About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Me too, Dusa. The happy-for-him part, at any rate! He's a good friend, and he deserved much better than to be stuck here.
DusaAboutGorgons01|Dusa About Gorgons 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Ms. Dusa, I ran into hostile gorgons that resembled you out there in Asphodel. Resembled only in the vaguest sense, I mean, they lacked your charm or social graces, anyway. I just, hope you are not related, since I sort of... you know.
DusaAboutGorgons01|Dusa About Gorgons 01|Dusa|Oh, *hahaha*, those old things? They're relatives just in the loosest sense, like... say you had some nasty, almost mindless siblings born entirely from your own blood, something like that? Do you have any idea how hard it was to get a steady job because of them?
DusaAboutGorgons01|Dusa About Gorgons 01|Zagreus|So I have your permission to continue hacking down such gorgons with impunity?
DusaAboutGorgons02|Dusa About Gorgons 02|Zagreus|I had another question about your relationship to other gorgons, Dusa. So... I notice you're not much for hissing, snakelike noises when you speak, and so on? Is that some sort of special gorgon language or something?
DusaAboutGorgons02|Dusa About Gorgons 02|Dusa|No, *um*, not exactly, Prince! It's what it sounds like, *hrrrsssss*!! Just, scary hissing, really, takes some practice not to sound like that with a forked tongue! I really wanted to fit in. Hey, how about you? Always wondered how come you have a surface accent. Weren't you born here?
DusaAboutGorgons02|Dusa About Gorgons 02|Zagreus|Oh, wait, me? I never gave it any thought. I... guess it's from my father. He insisted that he teach me how to speak, himself. Maybe it's in the blood.
DusaAboutGorgons03|Dusa About Gorgons 03|Zagreus|Hey, Dusa, this is kind of personal, and you don't have to answer, but I have to know. So... did you... use to have a body, and all that? Because, I've heard of gorgons, well... that you had wings, and such?
DusaAboutGorgons03|Dusa About Gorgons 03|Dusa|*Um*, Prince, so, look. That's something very private that you're asking, and... I know you don't mean any harm, but it just isn't something I discuss with anyone, OK? I'm who I am. Besides! As you can see, I don't need wings to fly!
DusaAboutGorgons03Aftermath01|Dusa About Gorgons 03 Aftermath 01|Zagreus|Ms. Dusa, I, *erm*, wanted to apologize for when I pried about your past. I just wanted to get to know you better, but... I was insensitive, and I'm sorry.
DusaAboutGorgons03Aftermath01|Dusa About Gorgons 03 Aftermath 01|Dusa|Oh, Your Highness, Zagreus, come on! Don't even worry about it! I'd already forgotten, really no big deal. It's just, the past me, it's as though... it wasn't even me. This is me, now! I'm glad I'm here.
DusaAboutGorgons04|Dusa About Gorgons 04|Zagreus|You know, it must be pretty handy, being able to turn somebody into stone. Is that something you can just do whenever you please, like... I don't know, sticking out your tongue or something?
DusaAboutGorgons04|Dusa About Gorgons 04|Dusa|Not quite as easy as all that, but not so hard! You have to get yourself pretty worked up, and picture what you're seeing like a... well, um, like a picture, really, and then, *fwoop*! Stone statue. It's funny, I used to think everybody could do it!
DusaAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Dusa About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Dusa|Hey, Prince, I saw that Orpheus, he got some time away, did you do that? He's visiting his muse, that's what he said! That's so exciting, I mean, they've been separated the whole time they've been dead!
DusaAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Dusa About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|They have a lot of catching up to do, for sure. Though I think they're going to be all right.
DusaAboutHypnos01|Dusa About Hypnos 01|Zagreus|Do you have to work with Hypnos pretty closely as part of your job, Dusa? Feels like I've been running into him a lot lately.
DusaAboutHypnos01|Dusa About Hypnos 01|Dusa|Mister Hypnos, I have trouble getting through to him, I think? He gives me plenty of advice, it's just, it isn't really why I talk to him. I... only talk to him when I don't have a lot of other choice, I guess.
DusaAboutMegRelationship01|Dusa About Meg Relationship 01|Dusa|Hey, Prince, is-is it really true? About Miss Meg and you, I mean, that you're, you know, um, I? You know!! Because, if so, then I want you to know, *I'm just so happy for the two of you*! That's wonderful, you two!! I'm so glad!
DusaAboutMegRelationship01|Dusa About Meg Relationship 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, thank you, Dusa, I know you and Miss Meg are close, so, I am grateful that we have your blessings. Though, we're kind of... not out in the open with it, necessarily, so if you please, just... keep it quiet for us, would you?
DusaAboutMegRelationship01|Dusa About Meg Relationship 01|Dusa|Oh, you better believe it, I will tell nobody whatsoever, *no*! I'll just be very, very happy to myself! All right, then! Bye!
DusaAboutThanRelationship01|Dusa About Than Relationship 01|Dusa|Hey, I saw you and Thanatos recently, Prince! You two, if you don't mind me saying, you are quite the pair, I mean, you ought to see yourselves! You're, *whew*...! Makes me a little woozy just remembering it now! Well, up I go, then, bye!
DusaAboutWork01|Dusa About Work 01|Zagreus|Dusa, I don't mean to upset you but, I'm worried you're going to burn yourself out if you keep pushing yourself past your limits... are you sure you don't need a break?
DusaAboutWork01|Dusa About Work 01|Dusa|I, I'm sure, Prince. This is my chance! I'm custodian of the House of Hades! I need to keep doing my best right now. Thanks so much for the Nectar! Bye!
DusaAboutFish01|Dusa About Fish 01|Dusa|Oh hey, you brought some fish, could smell it all the way from down the hall, that's great!! The Head Chef can take it off your hands, should be right in the back of the lounge like always! Thanks for helping us out, Prince!
DusaAboutSkelly01|Dusa About Skelly 01|Zagreus|Say, Dusa, in your work around the House, you wouldn't happen to have run into a *Skelly *character, out in the courtyard, there, have you?
DusaAboutSkelly01|Dusa About Skelly 01|Dusa|*Oh*! Not really, um, because, my work is in the House itself, and, well, the courtyard, technically, it's kind of right outside, so, I'm supposed to stay inside the walls. But, I think I know who you mean! I've seen him, standing there just past your chamber doors. Why, is he OK?
DusaAboutLoungeCleanUp01|Dusa About Lounge Clean Up 01|Zagreus|Have to tell you, Dusa, your job seems really stressful, here. It's a big House! You have to tend to the entire thing?
DusaAboutLoungeCleanUp01|Dusa About Lounge Clean Up 01|Dusa|Oh! Well, most of it isn't so bad at all, but... ever since Cerberus tore up the lounge, I... guess it's been a little hectic, getting everything back to normal like before!
DusaAboutLoungeCleanUp01|Dusa About Lounge Clean Up 01|Zagreus|I'm not sure it was ever normal around here, but... I'm sorry I created work for you. Cerberus tore the place apart because of me. Though, maybe I can help you patch things up?
DusaAboutLoungeCleanUp01|Dusa About Lounge Clean Up 01|Dusa|Don't say that, Prince! Cerberus knows better, and besides, you have your job to do, don't you? And I have mine! And I will do my very best at it, just wait and see!
DusaAboutPersephone01|Dusa About Persephone 01|Zagreus|Dusa, there is something you should know about me. Me and Nyx, that is. She's not my real mother...! My real mother's called Persephone. She's out there, somewhere. On the surface. That's why I left. Wait, just a moment, are you laughing?
DusaAboutPersephone01|Dusa About Persephone 01|Dusa|*Haha*, oh, uh, no, it's just, *uhh*... I'm really, really, really sorry, I can't help it, I, *um*, didn't want to interrupt, because, I kind of knew all that, already? Um, meaning, I had heard about it, everybody talks, you know, from time to time? But I just... really hope you find her soon!
DusaAboutPersephone01_B|Dusa About Persephone 01 B|Zagreus|Dusa, there is something you should know about me. Me and Nyx, that is. She's not my real mother...! My real mother's called Persephone. She's out there, somewhere. On the surface. That's why I left. Wait, just a moment, are you laughing?
DusaAboutPersephone01_B|Dusa About Persephone 01 B|Dusa|*Haha*, oh, uh, no, it's just, *uhh*... I'm really, really, really sorry, I can't help it, I, *um*, didn't want to interrupt, because, I kind of knew all that, already? Um, meaning, I had heard about it, everybody talks, you know, from time to time? But I just... really hope you find her soon!
DusaAboutPersephone01_B|Dusa About Persephone 01 B|Zagreus|I trust you not to mention this to everybody in the House, but... *I have*. Found her, that is! I'm... trying to figure out what happens next. Can't really talk about it yet, so... bear with me?
DusaAboutPersephone01_B|Dusa About Persephone 01 B|Dusa|*Whooa*, that is exciting, what's she really like? Is she tall? Does she have your eyes? Where does she live? What does she do? Does she have a job? What color is her hair? Is she, you know, is she with anybody?
DusaRunCleared01|Dusa Run Cleared 01|Dusa|*Whoa*, why, Prince, you're... wait, you're back? I mean, I thought...! I heard that...! How come you're still here?
DusaRunCleared01|Dusa Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|Oh, *hah*, yes! I made it pretty far! On that account you heard correctly, Dusa, but... turns out I have unfinished business here, so... I should be turning up like this from time to time.
DusaRunCleared01|Dusa Run Cleared 01|Dusa|Oh *wow*, well, that's great!! I mean, I hope it's great? I mean, if you agree it's great, I also think it's great! If that's OK?
DusaAboutHadesBedroom01|Dusa About Hades Bedroom 01|Zagreus|Dusa, in my father's chambers, he... he has a bedside portrait of somebody. Is... is she someone with whom you are familiar?
DusaAboutHadesBedroom01|Dusa About Hades Bedroom 01|Dusa|Oh, Prince, I'm not permitted in your father's chambers, are you kidding me? I'd ask you what it's like in there, but... I don't think I'm supposed to know!
DusaAboutLegendary01|Dusa About Legendary 01|Zagreus|Dusa, wherever did you get that Fidi Companion you gave me? You know how much that thing is worth? To me at least, I don't know who collects those anymore, but I sure do!
DusaAboutLegendary01|Dusa About Legendary 01|Dusa|*Oh*! I'm so glad you like her, Prince! I could think of no one better to take care of her, and best of all... she'll remind you of me! But as for where I got her, you're not going to believe it... can you guess?
DusaAboutLegendary01|Dusa About Legendary 01|Zagreus|What, wait, you don't mean... *no*, not from Nyx, herself? Did you, wait, Dusa... you didn't, how to put this, *borrow *her from Nyx, did you?
DusaAboutLegendary01|Dusa About Legendary 01|Dusa|*Haha*, no! Happen to value my job, here, among other aspects of my well-being, but... after the lounge assignment, Nyx herself commended me, and gave me Fidi as a nice reward! Although, she probably knew I'd just end up giving her to you!
DusaVsNyx01|Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Zagreus|How's your relationship with Nyx been lately, Dusa? She strikes me as a pretty intense supervisor. You getting on OK?
DusaVsNyx01|Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Dusa|Oh, Miss Nyx? I'll do whatever she says! Why, did she say something about me? She did, oh, why would you be asking otherwise, oh no. Am I losing my job?!
DusaVsNyx01|Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Zagreus|Hey, *no, no no*, it's not like that, it's just... a feeling that I've had from glimpses of the interactions that I've seen between you two. I haven't always got along with Nyx, but I know she cares deeply about this House and everyone in it. Including you.
DusaVsNyx01|Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Dusa|*Hahaha*, well, that's nice to know! She cares about my work performance, that's for very sure, and I am doing everything I can to live up to and exceed her expectations, tell her that!
DusaVsNyx02|Dusa Vs Nyx 02|Dusa|*Aah*! The Prince! Miss Nyx, she, I, I'm not supposed to talk to you! I have to go!
DusaVsNyx03|Dusa Vs Nyx 03|Zagreus|Dusa, *hey*, hey what's the matter, you seem... something's wrong, what happened? Tell me, please.
DusaVsNyx03|Dusa Vs Nyx 03|Dusa|No, Your Highness, you... you're not supposed to talk to me, I mean, I'm not supposed to talk to you, you see, Miss Nyx, she... oh, I will be in so much trouble, now!
DusaVsNyx03|Dusa Vs Nyx 03|Zagreus|Wait, Dusa, slow down, what is the matter? Nyx really has forbidden you from even speaking with me? Do you know on what grounds?
DusaVsNyx03|Dusa Vs Nyx 03|Dusa|I've no idea, Prince, I, look... I really want to keep my job here, so, I can't, I can't be seen with you right now, like this, please understand, I have to go, OK?
DusaVsNyx03Extra|Dusa Vs Nyx 03 Extra|Zagreus|Dusa, I... think that Nyx has some concerns... maybe with me, because it's like you said, she doesn't want us talking here like this. Is she... not satisfied with the work you've been doing, or something?
DusaVsNyx03Extra|Dusa Vs Nyx 03 Extra|Dusa|*Ah*, Prince, no, it isn't you, it's definitely me! There's all these things she said I need to work on, calmness, not making so many lists, putting things into perspective, not working myself too hard, not taking blame for things that aren't my fault...!
DusaVsNyx03Extra|Dusa Vs Nyx 03 Extra|Zagreus|Those sound like reasonable goals, though I just wish that Nyx could find a way to tell you that wasn't so upsetting. Won't you take care of yourself, Dusa, please?
DusaVsNyx03Extra|Dusa Vs Nyx 03 Extra|Dusa|...And plus, she said I'm not supposed to talk to you, she said that too, oh, I am going to be in so much trouble, *aah*!
DusaVsNyx04|Dusa Vs Nyx 04|Dusa|I, *um*, Prince, I... wanted to say good-bye, because... it's my last day. Or night? *Um*, anyway, it's really been a pleasure, knowing you, and working here, and so...!
DusaVsNyx04|Dusa Vs Nyx 04|Zagreus|*Wait, wait, wait*, what exactly happened, your last day or night, what is all this? You're really leaving? Why?
DusaVsNyx04|Dusa Vs Nyx 04|Dusa|I lost my job! Miss Nyx, she... it's her final word, and so... I need to go, before I make things any worse. Farewell, Highness! Farewell...!
DusaVsNyx05|Dusa Vs Nyx 05|Dusa|Prince, I... hi, again, I guess... I guess I'm back? At work, here, once again?
DusaVsNyx05|Dusa Vs Nyx 05|Zagreus|Imagine my relief. I'm glad that Nyx has come around. I... understand she was concerned, but... I hope she never looks past all your good qualities like that again.
DusaVsNyx05|Dusa Vs Nyx 05|Dusa|I hope so, too. I'm glad to have my job back. It's hard work, and I know there's more to life, such as it is, than this, but... it matters a lot to me, you know? I have to do this, so... I'm glad that all of you are letting me.
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance01|Dusa About Work Life Balance 01|Zagreus|So, what even happened when you lost your job, Dusa? Did you have someplace else to stay? Was everything all right?
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance01|Dusa About Work Life Balance 01|Dusa|You know, it's funny, after I was fired... at first, I just couldn't believe it, I... felt lost! But, after a few days or nights, it's like, it opened up my eyes, you know? Suddenly, I had all this time to myself, and... what I realized was, I was... so, so tired. I think I really needed the break.
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance01|Dusa About Work Life Balance 01|Zagreus|I'm surprised you wanted to come back to work after something like that. Wouldn't you be totally fed up? Burned out on the whole thing?
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance01|Dusa About Work Life Balance 01|Dusa|I love this work too much to get burned out, Prince. But that's me. I know there's more to being alive or being dead than just your work, but... my work happens to be important to me. And besides... if I don't push myself from time to time, how can I ever know my limits, right?
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance01|Dusa About Work Life Balance 01|Zagreus|But if you go too far beyond your limits, things can get bad. Believe me. I mean, you almost lost the job you care so much about.
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance01|Dusa About Work Life Balance 01|Dusa|You're right, I... need to be more careful, not to push myself too hard, too often. Hey, could I ask a favor? Would you tell me if I go too far with work again?
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance02|Dusa About Work Life Balance 02|Zagreus|How's work lately, Dusa? You seem to have a handle on your new responsibilities, or so I hear from Nyx.
DusaAboutWorkLifeBalance02|Dusa About Work Life Balance 02|Dusa|Oh yes, it's going pretty well, so far, I think! I have some new accounting duties, though I've parceled everything, and got a budget for a little extra help. It's funny, I-I should be busier than ever, but... I have more time to spare, lately, and things are good, I guess?
DusaAboutPromotion01|Dusa About Promotion 01|Zagreus|Dusa, hey, I wanted to congratulate you! Saw you were chosen as the featured servant of the House, getting your portrait there, right in the lounge for all to see! That's quite an honor!
DusaAboutPromotion01|Dusa About Promotion 01|Dusa|Oh, *haha*, it's really nothing, Prince, something that anybody could have done really, as long as they were fired up to do their very, very best, all the time, with a positive attitude, and without worrying too much about the overwhelming amount of work that still needs to be done!
DusaPostEnding01|Dusa Post Ending 01|Dusa|Oh, Prince! Persephone, your mother, wow, she's, *woww*...! It's no wonder you wanted to try to find her. She's something else! Although, I guess you didn't know that till you met her, huh? But, still!
DusaPostEnding01|Dusa Post Ending 01|Zagreus|It's definitely an adjustment, with my mother here. Especially for her! I'm glad the two of you are getting on all right. I guess things will be different, now, but... hopefully, it's for the better, isn't it?
DusaPostEnding01|Dusa Post Ending 01|Dusa|Are you kidding?! *Ah*, didn't mean to be so rude, it's just, I think it's definitely better, now! We're like a complete team!
DusaPostEnding02|Dusa Post Ending 02|Dusa|*Um*, Prince, so, is it... really true, then, that you're staying, and... that you'll be working here, officially, I guess?
DusaPostEnding02|Dusa Post Ending 02|Zagreus|I... well, when you put it that way, yes, I guess it is! We're going to try and make it work like this, for now.
DusaPostEnding02|Dusa Post Ending 02|Dusa|Well you know what this means, don't you? We're *official co-workers now*!! Isn't that so exciting? We can share our latest learnings, compare notes about the challenges we're up against, run into one another in the hall...
DusaPostEnding02|Dusa Post Ending 02|Zagreus|*Dusa*... we've been doing everything you said this entire time.
DusaPostEnding02|Dusa Post Ending 02|Dusa|But it is *not *the same! The entire feel of it's completely different, now! You'll see! So, OK!! Bye!
DusaPostEnding03|Dusa Post Ending 03|Zagreus|...I think I finally know a little more about how you must feel, Dusa. Working for Father, I mean. I was so intent on running away from here, but... here I am.
DusaPostEnding03|Dusa Post Ending 03|Dusa|Look, Prince, *um*... your father's always been a pretty scary god. And, this is something between you and him. Though, if you can forgive him, I guess... it means you'd stay? And I would like that, so... that's where I stand! I know it's really complicated, though.
DusaPostEpilogue01|Dusa Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Dusa, this whole place, it looks *immaculate*! That's even after all Olympus came here for that giant feast? How did you get everything clean so fast?
DusaPostEpilogue01|Dusa Post Epilogue 01|Dusa|Oh, *ha-hah*! Well! I guess I have my ways, Prince. Sometimes you get one of those jobs and you just want to give it everything you've got, you know? I get a lot of jobs like that! Feeding Cerberus, cleaning the rafters! But this one? I just knew it was the perfect job for me!
DusaWithHypnos01|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (1)|Hypnos|Oh, *uh*, hey there, Dusa! How's your endless toil treating you?
DusaWithHypnos01|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (1)|Dusa|*Um*, Mister Hypnos, do you... maybe think that you could, you know, *uh*, keep an eye on the procession line before Lord Hades? Like you were supposed to...?
DusaWithHypnos01|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (1)|Hypnos|*Oh*! Um, that's no problem, I can definitely do that, I'll just add it to the list!
DusaWithHypnos01|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (1)|Dusa|*Um*, good, then! Glad we had a chance to chat. Now, maybe get some sleep or something. You look pretty beat...?
DusaWithHypnos02|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (2)|Dusa|Mister Hypnos, I, *uh*, wanted to check in with you again, regarding the procession line that's... right in front of you, right over there, it's... moving pretty slow.
DusaWithHypnos02|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (2)|Hypnos|I *know*! Those shades, they just go on and on, and *on and on*, forever, blathering about this or that! I mean, Lord Hades, it's a wonder he can *stand *it, listening to them every day or night!
DusaWithHypnos02|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (2)|Dusa|*Um*, well, it's just, I think you were supposed to keep things moving, so, if they're taking too long, I guess that maybe you could say something, or... any bright ideas?
DusaWithHypnos02|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (2)|Hypnos|It's a toughie, Dusa, because I think it's important that the shades who wait their turn, why, that they get a chance to say their piece! But it's a real tricky situation you bring up, so, let me tell you what I'm going to do: I am going to sleep on it! And then, get back to you!
DusaWithHypnos02|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (2)|Dusa|OK, well... if you don't, though, I'll check in with you again, later, I guess? Because, I'm under orders, so... *um*... bye...
DusaWithHypnos03|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (3)|Hypnos|Heya Dusa, let me guess! You're here regarding the procession of these shades, who have been standing here for quite some time, clogging the hall a bit... they've barely moved at all!
DusaWithHypnos03|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (3)|Dusa|Y, you guessed it, Mister Hypnos, so... have you, um, given any thought to maybe focusing the traffic flow through here a little bit, to keep the hallway clearer, and, oh, I don't know, put some sort of time limit in place?
DusaWithHypnos03|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (3)|Hypnos|You know, can't say I have! I've got my registration list, and I have had to keep a careful eye on it, with all the shades that have been pouring in? It's really gotten slow around here!
DusaWithHypnos03|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (3)|Dusa|It definitely has, I... have to go, um, hope you get yourself some rest, OK?
DusaWithHypnos04|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (4)|Dusa|I can't believe it, Mister Hypnos, how... *how did you do it*? All the shades that have been lining up, they... they've been moving right along!
DusaWithHypnos04|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (4)|Hypnos|You know, you're right, *they have*! They definitely have. It's pretty hard to notice, since they're slow, but I have a keen eye. And so do you! You noticed before I did in this case. What did you say your question was back there?
DusaWithHypnos04|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (4)|Dusa|I asked you how you did it, got the traffic flow moving a little faster, and... it's the sarcophagus things, isn't it? Right down the hall! The shades, they're scared to stand around! That's brilliant, Mister Hypnos, I'm impressed!
DusaWithHypnos04|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (4)|Hypnos|Oh, *hahaha*, that, well, really, it was nothing, Dusa! Though, I'll tell you something! It is good to know that you're impressed with me!
DusaWithHypnos04|Duo - Dusa and Hypnos (4)|Dusa|I, *haha*, don't know if I'd go that far, um, anyway! I'll mark this as resolved!
DusaWithNyx01|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (1)|Nyx|...And after that, Dusa, you are to clean the rafters once again, and prune the gardens thoroughly. By then it should be time to tend the kitchens, and sweep the lounging area a second time...
DusaWithNyx01|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (1)|Dusa|Y, yes, right away!
DusaWithNyx02|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (2)|Nyx|...Lastly, Dusa, you are not permitted to address the Prince, unless first spoken to. You are invisible to him. Now, are we understood?
DusaWithNyx02|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (2)|Dusa|Yes, Miss Nyx, we're understood, I mean... I understand. I, I'll be going, then.
DusaWithNyx03|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (3)|Dusa|Miss Nyx, you're...? Do I want my job again, I... *wha*, I, more than anything! This job, it, it means everything to me, I mean, working with *you*? You are the Night Itself! This place, and all of you, all of it, it's so amazing to me, and I just... I, just I want to help! Just, give me one more chance!
DusaWithNyx03|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (3)|Nyx|Your one more chance has certain stipulations, Dusa. If you think it is necessary to exceed the allotted time for your responsibilities, I expect you to ask. You are not the sole bearer of this House's fate. Your temperament toward your work is as important as the end result. Now then... I would ask that you return to your post.
DusaWithNyx03|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (3)|Dusa|What, I, Miss Nyx, you mean... like, start right now? *Now *now? I mean, I, I don't have a lot of pressing obligations, so, I'll do it, *yes*!! I accept! I'm so excited to be back! Where do I even start, I can survey the lounge, sweep the cobwebs, walk Cerberus, check the pantry, ah, OK, I'm off!!
DusaWithNyx04|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (4)|Nyx|...and, therefore, for your diligence and service, and for having demonstrated such improvement... by my authority as Night Itself, I hereby name you Chief Custodian of the House of Hades, and appoint to you the privileges implied. Bear the responsibility with honor, Dusa.
DusaWithNyx04|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (4)|Dusa|Miss Nyx, I am truly honored, and, I'm very grateful for this opportunity, and for the trust you've placed in me, in this expanded role. I promise you, I will not let you down. Not you, or anybody here! Thank you so much!!
DusaWithNyx04|Duo - Dusa and Nyx (4)|Nyx|You are most welcome. The orderliness of this House is a reflection of the realm as a whole. You have internalized this, and understood that a disciplined approach toward work is far more valuable than mere exertion of effort. Although, you understand the need for exertion, as well.
DusaWithMegaera01|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (1)|Megaera|...And then, all seven of those wretches tried cutting to the front of the procession line, can you believe the nerve? As though they'd get an audience that way.
DusaWithMegaera01|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (1)|Dusa|*Ha, hahah*, what a bunch of dummies! What were they even thinking, cutting the line, I mean, in front of *you*?
DusaWithMegaera01|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (1)|Megaera|Let's just say, if they still have any complaints for our Lord Hades, they'll be waiting for a long, long time before they get the chance to bring them up.
DusaWithMegaera02|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (2)|Megaera|...I swear you're right that one is such an idiot...! Though anyway, I'd best get back to work. Next round's on me, Dusa, and you take care.
DusaWithMegaera02|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (2)|Dusa|You take care, too, Miss Meg, thanks for the drink! Bye now...!
DusaWithMegaera03|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (3)|Megaera|...Follow your heart? That's odd advice, especially from you. Though, no offense intended.
DusaWithMegaera03|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (3)|Dusa|I just mean, if you don't believe in the work you're doing, why keep on doing it, just out of obligation? You have to take care of yourself.
DusaWithMegaera03|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (3)|Megaera|I don't think there's any rush for that. We won't just shrivel up and die in forty years like mortals do. But, I know what you're saying. I'll think about it, Dusa. Thanks.
DusaWithMegaera04|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (4)|Megaera|...We got off on the wrong foot from the start. Just what happens when you're born of Titan blood, I guess. It's for the best we haven't crossed paths much since.
DusaWithMegaera04|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (4)|Dusa|But they're your sisters, I mean... they're family! You must have something in common, some way of, I don't know, seeing eye to eye?
DusaWithMegaera04|Duo - Dusa and Megaera (4)|Megaera|You're more my sister than they are to me, Dusa. I don't always agree with Lord Hades but I am thankful that they're not permitted in this House.
DusaWithMegaeraHighAffinity01|Duo - Dusa and Megaera High Affinity (1)|Megaera|...You sure that you're all right, with everything? I just... I wouldn't want you to be caught up in the middle of all this. If you so much as said to call it off...
DusaWithMegaeraHighAffinity01|Duo - Dusa and Megaera High Affinity (1)|Dusa|No, *nononono*, no, Meg, no! No, Meg! Come on, now, are you kidding me? I mean, I couldn't be happier about it, really! You deserve this! As long as you're happy, yourself, right?
DusaWithMegaeraHighAffinity01|Duo - Dusa and Megaera High Affinity (1)|Megaera|Well, thank you, Dusa. You've always been so kind. I don't quite know what to say.
DusaWithMegaeraHighAffinity01|Duo - Dusa and Megaera High Affinity (1)|Dusa|Hey, now, that's my line! Look, though, I better get going, but, I just want to say this is great news, all right? Thank you for telling me!
DusaWithHades01|Duo - Dusa and Hades (1)|Hades|...Would that all my subjects exhibited such promptness. Your report, then, if you please, Dusa?
DusaWithHades01|Duo - Dusa and Hades (1)|Dusa|Sir! The office currently is running smoothly, sir! Lounge attendance is up by twenty-eight percent, with customer satisfaction ratings in the eightieth percentile. No issues to report at this time.
DusaWithHades01|Duo - Dusa and Hades (1)|Hades|See that we achieve *thirty *percent before the turn of the aeon, Chief Custodian. Other than that... a satisfactory report. Now, carry on.
DusaWithPersephone01|Duo - Dusa and Persephone (1)|Dusa|*Um*, it's my great pleasure to make your acquaintance. Call me Dusa, please! I, I'm your House custodian? And I am at your service! Anything you need, just call, OK?
DusaWithPersephone01|Duo - Dusa and Persephone (1)|Persephone|Dusa! Wonderful to know you! This House is immaculate! Night-and-day difference from before. Now I know exactly whom to compliment.
DusaWithPersephone01|Duo - Dusa and Persephone (1)|Dusa|Thanks so much! I will not let you down!!
DusaChat01|Dusa Chat 01|Dusa|I, I, I, oh *no*, I, just forgot something, I, I have to go!
DusaChat02|Dusa Chat 02|Dusa|Oh, *um*, Your Highness, I was just, making the rounds again!!
DusaChat03|Dusa Chat 03|Dusa|Um, everything is spick and span like always, Your Highness!!
DusaChat04|Dusa Chat 04|Dusa|Y-you'd tell me if I did anything wrong, wouldn't you, Prince?
DusaChat05|Dusa Chat 05|Dusa|...dusted the halls, dusted the library, dusted the sconces, dusted the doorknobs, dusted the chairs...
DusaChat06|Dusa Chat 06|Dusa|...let's see, I cleaned the mantle, cleaned the rafters, cleaned the skulls, cleaned the bar-room...
DusaChat07|Dusa Chat 07|Dusa|Oh, *um*, hi! Hello, Your Highness, nice to see you! Thanks!
DusaChat08|Dusa Chat 08|Dusa|Working hard, Your Highness! Always working!
DusaChat08|Dusa Chat 08|Dusa|I'll make sure everything is taken care of!
DusaChat09|Dusa Chat 09|Dusa|Oh, *hahaha*, thanks for talking to me, Prince, I have to go!
DusaChat10|Dusa Chat 10|Dusa|Hi Prince, I fed Cerberus already, all three heads!
DusaChat11|Dusa Chat 11|Dusa|*Wha, hah-haha*, oh, you startled me, Your Highness...!
DusaChat12|Dusa Chat 12|Dusa|I'm just keeping *busy busy busy *here like always, Prince!
DusaChat13|Dusa Chat 13|Dusa|I, I, I, I'm sorry that you died again out there, Your Highness...!
DusaChat14|Dusa Chat 14|Dusa|Oh, *um*, hi! Is... everything all right, there, Prince?
DusaChat15|Dusa Chat 15|Dusa|Nothing gets dirty around here while I am on the job, Your Highness...!
DusaChat16|Dusa Chat 16|Dusa|Don't worry, Prince! I'll keep an eye on things!
DusaChat17|Dusa Chat 17|Dusa|You can count on me, Your Highness!
DusaChat18|Dusa Chat 18|Dusa|Anything I can do for you right now, or, maybe later...?
DusaChat19|Dusa Chat 19|Dusa|...let's see, I did the dishes, fed the heads, cleaned the cupboards, cleared the pool...
DusaChat20|Dusa Chat 20|Dusa|Oh, Prince, *um*, I'm supposed to be at work, so, I can't talk, OK?
DusaChat21|Dusa Chat 21|Dusa|Excuse me, sorry, I just have to file this report, it's *very *late!
DusaChat22|Dusa Chat 22|Dusa|I, I, I have everything here well under control, Highness!!
DusaChat23|Dusa Chat 23|Dusa|What, is something wrong, Prince? I'll look into it, right now, up there!!
DusaChat24|Dusa Chat 24|Dusa|Am I in trouble for something again, or, no...?
DusaChat25|Dusa Chat 25|Dusa|I'm always at 110%, *hah, hahah*!
DusaChat26|Dusa Chat 26|Dusa|*Um*, I, I, I, I'm sorry, I, I better get back to my cleaning...!
DusaChatExtra01|Dusa Chat Extra 01|Dusa|Oh, *wow*! I'm so sorry, Prince, I'm just behind already on my daily chores!
DusaChatExtra02|Dusa Chat Extra 02|Dusa|*Ah! Haha*, got me again, Prince, sneaking up on me like that!
DusaChatExtra03|Dusa Chat Extra 03|Dusa|You'll get them next time, Prince, I'm sure of it! I think?
DusaChatExtra04|Dusa Chat Extra 04|Dusa|Just making sure the lounge is squeaky clean!
DusaChatExtra05|Dusa Chat Extra 05|Dusa|This is going to be the *best *lounge in all the Underworld!
DusaChatExtra06|Dusa Chat Extra 06|Dusa|You let me know if you see any dust around here, won't you, Prince?
DusaChatExtra07|Dusa Chat Extra 07|Dusa|You rest assured I'm not even *remotely *tired, Prince!
DusaChatExtra08|Dusa Chat Extra 08|Dusa|Please count on me for all your household needs!
DusaChatExtra09|Dusa Chat Extra 09|Dusa|I'll make sure Cerberus has everything he needs while you're out!
DusaChatExtra10|Dusa Chat Extra 10|Dusa|Don't tell me I'm in trouble, am I, Prince?!
DusaChatExtra11|Dusa Chat Extra 11|Dusa|Just thought I'd mention, I, I really love this job!!
DusaChatExtra12|Dusa Chat Extra 12|Dusa|...stocked the store room, checked the locks, cleaned the tiles, watered the trees...
DusaChatExtra13|Dusa Chat Extra 13|Dusa|...checked the contracts, cleared the ledgers, set the tables, washed the windows...
DusaChatExtra14|Dusa Chat Extra 14|Dusa|...sorted the files, gathered the feedback, updated the schedule, sent the report...
DusaMaxChat01|Dusa Max Chat 01|Dusa|You please take care of yourself, OK, Prince?
DusaMaxChat02|Dusa Max Chat 02|Dusa|I sometimes get so worried for you, Zagreus...!
DusaMaxChat03|Dusa Max Chat 03|Dusa|Don't worry, Prince, I have everything here well under control...!
DusaMaxChat04|Dusa Max Chat 04|Dusa|I hope you have a great whatever time it is out there, Highness!
DusaMaxChat05|Dusa Max Chat 05|Dusa|I will definitely keep an eye on things while you are out!
DusaMaxChat06|Dusa Max Chat 06|Dusa|Just in the middle of a wall-to-wall inspection right now, Prince!
DusaMaxChat07|Dusa Max Chat 07|Dusa|Heard everything's been good lately between you and Miss Meg!
DusaMaxChat08|Dusa Max Chat 08|Dusa|Eternal friends forever, right, Prince Zagreus?
DusaMaxChat09|Dusa Max Chat 09|Dusa|So glad to see you back here, Your Highness!
DusaMaxChat10|Dusa Max Chat 10|Dusa|Made sure the House was nice and tidy for you, Prince!
DusaMaxChat11|Dusa Max Chat 11|Dusa|Your Highness, *hi*! All's well here, nothing to report!!
DusaMaxChat12|Dusa Max Chat 12|Dusa|Looks like we've both been keeping busy, *huh*, Your Highness?
DusaMaxChat13|Dusa Max Chat 13|Dusa|*Whew*, I have been so busy, lately, Prince! The same as you!
DusaMaxChat14|Dusa Max Chat 14|Dusa|Sorry, not much time to chat more right now, Prince!
DusaMaxChat15|Dusa Max Chat 15|Dusa|We'll have to catch up in the lounge sometime, *huh*, Prince?
DusaMaxChat16|Dusa Max Chat 16|Dusa|Oh, *haha*, you startled me, there, Prince!
DusaMaxChat17|Dusa Max Chat 17|Dusa|Hold on, Prince! Think I saw some dust I missed up there!
DusaMaxChat18|Dusa Max Chat 18|Dusa|Sorry, got to file this report, now, Prince!
DusaMaxChat19|Dusa Max Chat 19|Dusa|Nice to see you, now I'm off to clean the rafters once again!
DusaMaxChat20|Dusa Max Chat 20|Dusa|I'm on duty right now, but it's really nice to see you like this, Prince!
DusaMaxChat21|Dusa Max Chat 21|Dusa|I know your job gets frustrating sometimes, so please remember to take breaks, all right?
DusaMaxChat22|Dusa Max Chat 22|Dusa|I hope you're always finding joy in work like I do, Prince!
DusaMaxChat23|Dusa Max Chat 23|Dusa|From the reports I've seen it looks like you've been doing such great work out there!
DusaChatWithMegaera01|Duo - Chat and Megaera (1)|Megaera|Not now, Zag. Private meeting.
DusaChatWithMegaera01|Duo - Chat and Megaera (1)|Dusa|Don't work yourself too hard, OK, Highness?
DusaChatWithMegaera02|Duo - Chat and Megaera (2)|Dusa|Please do remember to take breaks, OK?
DusaChatWithMegaera02|Duo - Chat and Megaera (2)|Megaera|We'll have to chat some other time, here, Zag.
DusaChatWithMegaera03|Duo - Chat and Megaera (3)|Dusa|You get rest from time to time, for me, OK?
DusaChatWithMegaera04|Duo - Chat and Megaera (4)|Dusa|I hope you get to see Miss Meg out there next time!
DusaChatWithMegaera05|Duo - Chat and Megaera (5)|Dusa|I hope you'll get to see Thanatos again soon!
DusaChatWithMegaera06|Duo - Chat and Megaera (6)|Megaera|Can't you see we're in the middle of a conversation, Zagreus?
DusaChatWithMegaera07|Duo - Chat and Megaera (7)|Megaera|Excuse us, Zagreus, we're in the middle of a meeting here.
DusaChatWithMegaera08|Duo - Chat and Megaera (8)|Megaera|You know you can just let us talk without being interrupted, Zagreus?
DusaChatWithMegaera08|Duo - Chat and Megaera (8)|Megaera|This particular discussion doesn't concern you, Zag.
DusaChatWithMegaera09|Duo - Chat and Megaera (9)|Megaera|...Sometimes, though, Dusa, he's not the best at taking hints...
DusaChatWithCerberus01|Duo - Chat and Cerberus (1)|Dusa|Now, here you go, Cerbie! And, um, don't eat me, please?
DusaChatWithCerberus02|Duo - Chat and Cerberus (2)|Dusa|*Um*, here you go, boy! Triple order, just the way you like it!
DusaChatWithCerberus03|Duo - Chat and Cerberus (3)|Dusa|...Just, please be careful where you go after you eat all this, this time, OK, Cerbie?
DusaChatWithCerberus04|Duo - Chat and Cerberus (4)|Dusa|*Oh*, come on, Cerbie, hurry up and eat! This stuff can't be that bad! I mean... can it?
DusaGift01|Dusa Gift 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Ms. Dusa? I wanted you to have this. It's nothing really, just... for your hard work.
DusaGift01|Dusa Gift 01|Dusa|P-P-Prince, I'm really grateful for this, really, and I thought, I, kind of got something for you...?
DusaGift02|Dusa Gift 02|Dusa|*Wh-whaaaa*, b-but, there must be some mistake, I, Prince, you're giving this to *me*...?
DusaGift02|Dusa Gift 02|Zagreus|I want you to know we all appreciate you, Dusa. Don't work yourself too hard on my account, OK?
DusaGift03|Dusa Gift 03|Dusa|*Ohh*, oh, oh, oh my, Your Highness, are you... are you really sure you want me to have *this*?
DusaGift03|Dusa Gift 03|Zagreus|I really am, Dusa. I hope you enjoy it.
DusaGift04|Dusa Gift 04|Dusa|B-b-but, Prince, I, don't know what to say, I... are you joking around with me, maybe...?
DusaGift04|Dusa Gift 04|Zagreus|Oh, I am deadly serious, Dusa, honest. It's for you.
DusaGift05_Alt|Dusa Gift 05 Alt|Zagreus|Dusa, you must work harder than anyone in this House, keeping everything so neat and orderly. I don't think it should be thankless work, so, thank you! And I'd like for you to have this.
DusaGift05_Alt|Dusa Gift 05 Alt|Dusa|Oh, Prince, *wow*, thank you! Thanks so much!! You've been so generous, I... I think I'm speechless! No, can't think of anything to say right now!
DusaGift05_Alt|Dusa Gift 05 Alt|Zagreus|Oh, you said it all! Don't mean to put you on the spot or anything. I'm just glad we've had a chance to get to know each other.
DusaGift05_Alt|Dusa Gift 05 Alt|Dusa|I... I'm glad we've had a chance to know each other, too. Thanks for the Nectar! I can tell it's really, really good! *Um*, OK, bye!
DusaGift06|Dusa Gift 06|Zagreus|Hey Dusa? Here's some more of this really, really good Nectar for you! Please keep up the wonderful work, and more importantly, keep being your wonderful self.
DusaGift06|Dusa Gift 06|Dusa|I, I, I, I'm really very flattered, Prince, but, I've just been so busy, lately, that I haven't even had a chance to try the last bottle you gave me, so... you want this back, maybe for someone else?
DusaGift06|Dusa Gift 06|Zagreus|Please, it's yours! Besides, you must have some time off coming up when you can enjoy it, don't you?
DusaGift06|Dusa Gift 06|Dusa|*Oh*! I mean, maybe I do? I think maybe I do, except, nobody's told me anything about that, and besides, there's so much work to do around the House still, I just can't leave everything like this!!
DusaGift07|Dusa Gift 07|Zagreus|Hey, Dusa? Congratulations on completing your assignment with the lounge. Look at this place! It's better than ever. All thanks to your effort and dedication. Here, this is for you. Something special for the occasion.
DusaGift07|Dusa Gift 07|Dusa|*Whoa*, I, this, this is *Ambrosia*, Prince! But, this is for *gods*...! This isn't for... someone like me? But, wait, wait wait, no, here, I'm going to do it, I am going to do it, here, take *this*!! I got it, just for you, so, take it, please! Farewell!!
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Zagreus|Ambrosia isn't only for the gods, you know, Dusa. It's for anyone we really care about. So, here. Please, enjoy this, or... just add it to the lounge's stash. Whatever suits you.
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Dusa|*Oh*, I, but, you... really mean that, huh...? But, you're the Prince himself, and I'm just... look, we both know I am just a floating monster head. And a custodian. I just don't understand. Why keep on being nice to me, like this? I thought you'd never even talk to me...
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Zagreus|You're so much more than what you said. I wish you could see that. If only everybody in this House had your spirit.
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Dusa|*Ah*. If only everybody in this House had yours, Prince Zagreus. You've been so kind to me, and I'm glad we've had a chance to get to know each other more. It's really nice, sometimes... knowing somebody really cares about me here?
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Zagreus|It should be more than sometimes that you feel that way, as far as I'm concerned. I just... I've never met anybody like you before. My father always told me not to smile quite as much, but... you're like me.
DusaGift08|Dusa Gift 08|Dusa|What, because I smile, *haha*? Smiling's just a little something that I like to do to deal with the day! Though, oh, *that's *what you meant, I... oh, I see. I, look, this is kind of a lot, I, I had better go...! I'll cherish the Ambrosia, though, OK?!
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|I got you more Ambrosia, Dusa, and I hope this is OK. I figure maybe you could use this for the lounge? Special events, guests, that sort of thing?
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|...I'm sorry that I flew away last time you brought me something like this, Prince... I mean, Zagreus. It's really strange for me to call you that, I... when I started here, they told me not to even speak with you, and now, *uh*... here we are...!
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|Well, look, if I listened to everything I was told, my life would be a lot different and a lot worse off, I think! So... who cares what anybody says? I enjoy your company.
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|And I enjoy yours, too! Wasn't long ago that I was just a lonely gorgon head, all by myself in the big Underworld, looking for steady work. And then, I heard about the opening here, in your father's House? Well I got it! It seemed too good to be real. And then, there was you...
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Zagreus|I remember when we first met. You were carrying three bowls for Cerberus and bumped right into me. It all went flying, but you cleaned up half of it before it hit the ground. Then flew away before I got your name. I thought I'd never see you again.
DusaGift09|Dusa Gift 09|Dusa|I was *so *embarrassed! Worse... I thought I was done for, here. But, I got another chance! That was your doing, wasn't it? You've been looking out for me, all this time! That's so sweet of you, I... I don't know how to thank you, I... I, I better put this Ambrosia away, for safe keeping, OK?
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Zagreus|Dusa, I was thinking that this batch of Ambrosia ought to hold the lounge over for quite a while! Keep things livelier for everyone. And, please take a bottle for yourself, won't you? As a token of my affection.
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Dusa|*Oh*! Y-you said your *affection*, huh, I... wow! I... really like you, also, Zagreus. I liked you from the start! You were so different from your father, and Miss Nyx, I could just tell, but... wait, what am I saying, I am such a dummy! You're just being friendly with me, right...?
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Zagreus|I would be more than that, if it pleased you. You're very wonderful, and... you light up this House. But I would never risk our friendship, so, if this is where we draw the boundary, please, just let me know.
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Dusa|*Um*... wait, wait. Wait, wait. Did you just say I'm... *wonderful*?
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Zagreus|I did, indeed. And I am glad to get it off my chest, if you must know! Though... what about you? How do you feel?
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Dusa|I, *wow*, I, I never thought you'd... have those kinds of feelings, for somebody like me. It's really nice to hear! It makes me feel complete. But, *um*, Zagreus, I don't know if I can be what you need, I mean? Wait. You weren't, you weren't just being nice to me for all this time, because...?
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Zagreus|*What*? No, no, Dusa, of course not, I... *ungh*, why is it so damn difficult to share one's feelings with somebody else? I don't want to ruin what we have. If only you could see what's in my heart.
DusaGift10|Dusa Gift 10|Dusa|Oh, *hahaha*, I was just checking, don't feel bad, OK? You don't seem capable of hiding what's in your heart. And I mean that in the best possible way. I'm so happy, it's just... all this is a lot, and, I'm on duty right now, but... see you soon...?
DusaGift05|Dusa Gift 05|Dusa|Oh no, no no no, Your Highness, are you, really giving this to me?
DusaGift05|Dusa Gift 05|Zagreus|Yes, yes I am, Ms. Dusa, and I hope you enjoy it. Be seeing you, OK?
CharonFirstMeeting|Charon First Meeting|Charon|*Gguhhhhhh*....
CharonFirstMeeting|Charon First Meeting|Zagreus|Why good to see you, Charon mate! Just minding my own business, taking in the sights, and, hey what's that you got, some sort of wares for sale? Then, I'll just have a look around.
CharonFirstMeeting_Alt|Charon First Meeting Alt|Charon|*Gguhhhhhh*....
CharonFirstMeeting_Alt|Charon First Meeting Alt|Zagreus|Why good to see you, Charon mate! Just minding my own business, taking in the sights, and, sure is awfully convenient to be running into you like this! I'd all this coin I wanted to get rid of.
CharonNoFastTravelBackstory01|Charon No Fast Travel Backstory 01|Zagreus|Charon mate, now hypothetically, if I provided you with, say, a thousand coins, would you be willing to give me a ride in your beautiful boat? Upriver, I should say, specifically.
CharonNoFastTravelBackstory01|Charon No Fast Travel Backstory 01|Charon|Nrrnnhhh, hnnnn, *hrrnn*, hrrrrrnnn....
CharonNoFastTravel01|Charon No Fast Travel 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Charon, mate...? I don't suppose you've given any further thought to my proposal to, just, you know... ferry me up to the surface? Seeing as it's not out of your way.
CharonNoFastTravel01|Charon No Fast Travel 01|Charon|*Rhhuuaaauuggghhh*....
CharonShopMeeting01|Charon Shop Meeting 01|Zagreus|Got to say, you are a sight for sore eyes, there, Charon! So, uh... looks like you're selling, is that it? You come to help me out?
CharonShopMeeting01|Charon Shop Meeting 01|Charon|Uunngggghhhh....
CharonShopMeeting02|Charon Shop Meeting 02|Zagreus|Hey good to see you out here, mate! And looks as though you've got some fine wares up for sale, don't you?
CharonShopMeeting02|Charon Shop Meeting 02|Charon|*Urrrnn*gghhhhh....
CharonShopMeeting03|Charon Shop Meeting 03|Charon|*Haaahhhhhhhhh*....
CharonShopMeeting03|Charon Shop Meeting 03|Zagreus|Fine day to you as well, there, mate! Now let's have a look at your supply, shall we?
CharonShopMeeting04|Charon Shop Meeting 04|Zagreus|You must have a lot of stops around these parts, don't you, Charon mate. Most of the dead are here in Asphodel, correct?
CharonShopMeeting04|Charon Shop Meeting 04|Charon|Nnnnrrrrrhhh....
CharonShopMeeting05|Charon Shop Meeting 05|Zagreus|Hey, Charon, I'm in Asphodel now, aren't I? I'd always heard this was some flower-covered meadow type place, not such a... terrifying hellscape.
CharonShopMeeting05|Charon Shop Meeting 05|Charon|Hhhhaaaaaaahhh....
CharonPreBossMeeting01|Charon Pre Boss Meeting 01|Zagreus|Hey, Charon. If there happens to be something really horrible awaiting me beyond that door there, then... give me a sign, won't you?
CharonPreBossMeeting01|Charon Pre Boss Meeting 01|Charon|Hhhaaaaaaahhh....
CharonPreBossMeeting02|Charon Pre Boss Meeting 02|Zagreus|Care to provide me any insight as to just what sort of hideous monstrosity awaits me over on the next infernal island, Charon mate?
CharonPreBossMeeting02|Charon Pre Boss Meeting 02|Charon|*Hheeehhhhhhh*....
CharonHighRelationship01|Charon High Relationship 01|Zagreus|Well, look at you, Charon mate, you're looking well! Something's different about you, can't quite put my finger on it. Have you done something with your hair?
CharonHighRelationship01|Charon High Relationship 01|Charon|*Urrraaauuhggghh*...
CharonAboutHourglass01|Charon About Hourglass 01|Zagreus|Hey, Charon mate, wanted to thank you once again for the fine hourglass you gave to me before! It's been very handy with those Wells of yours.
CharonAboutHourglass01|Charon About Hourglass 01|Charon|*Hheeehhhhhhh*....
CharonPostFight_YouWon01|Charon Post Fight You Won 01|Zagreus|Hey Charon, you're not angry with me after we had it out last time, are you, I mean... I figured since you gave me one of your Loyalty Cards, must mean everything's fine, but... I'm... just making sure.
CharonPostFight_YouWon01|Charon Post Fight You Won 01|Charon|Krrr, *krraauuuggghhhh*...!
CharonPostFight_YouLost01|Charon Post Fight You Lost 01|Zagreus|No hard feelings about that whole battle-to-the-death thing last time, right, Charon? Especially since you absolutely demolished me. I was just messing with you, you know that, right?
CharonPostFight_YouLost01|Charon Post Fight You Lost 01|Charon|Nrraaauuuggghhh...!
CharonAboutHermes01|Charon About Hermes 01|Zagreus|Hi Charon! I finally met Hermes, god of swiftness, travel, bringing souls of the departed to your boat. Calls you his professional associate. You and he, you've been working together for a while, haven't you?
CharonAboutHermes01|Charon About Hermes 01|Charon|Hrrrrrrnnnnghhhhhhhh...
CharonAboutHermes02|Charon About Hermes 02|Zagreus|Charon, I always thought Olympians never consorted with chthonic gods such as yourself. But it sounds like Hermes is a close colleague of yours. You wouldn't... happen to know why he's helping me, would you?
CharonAboutHermes02|Charon About Hermes 02|Charon|Grrrhhhooo*aaaaaahhhh*...!
CharonAboutHermes03|Charon About Hermes 03|Zagreus|Charon, Hermes told me that the other Olympians are unaware he's lending his support to me. I'm curious to know what's going on. Thinking of asking Nyx. Figured I'd check with you first.
CharonAboutHermes03|Charon About Hermes 03|Charon|Mmnnn*rraaauuugggghhh*!!
CharonAboutSkelly01|Charon About Skelly 01|Zagreus|Charon mate, I know you meet an awful lot of dead, and it probably gets very difficult to remember them all, but... I don't suppose the name *Skelly *means anything to you, does it?
CharonAboutSkelly01|Charon About Skelly 01|Charon|...Ssss... kkkhhh... rrrrnngghhh... *raauuuggghhh*!!
CharonAboutCustomerLoyalty01|Charon About Customer Loyalty 01|Zagreus|Charon mate? As a longtime customer, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you again for your invaluable service as a part of my repeated attempts at getting out of here. What would I have done without your wares all these many times? Besides dying a lot faster.
CharonAboutCustomerLoyalty01|Charon About Customer Loyalty 01|Charon|Hrrnngghh, grhhh, *grhaaaaaaaahhhh*...
CharonPostEnding01|Charon Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Charon, mate? Wanted to thank you very, very much for bringing Mother and me home. Your boat's quite comfortable, you know! Though, I suppose you won't be making a habit of giving me a ride, will you?
CharonPostEnding01|Charon Post Ending 01|Charon|Hrrrhh*haaaaauuugghhh*...!
CharonPostEnding02|Charon Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Charon, as I know you serve the realm, I just wanted to say I look forward to continuing to work with you in a somewhat more official capacity. I'll still be breaking out of here like always, but... well, you've probably heard.
CharonPostEnding02|Charon Post Ending 02|Charon|*Nnnrrraaaauggghhhh*....
CharonPostEpilogue01|Charon Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Hope you enjoyed the feast with the Olympians, Charon! We didn't have much of a chance to chat, though it looked like you and Hermes were having a good time.
CharonPostEpilogue01|Charon Post Epilogue 01|Charon|Krrhh, *hrraaaahhh*...!
CharonAboutSecretService01|Charon About Secret Service 01|Zagreus|Charon? Unrelated to anything whatsoever, I just wanted to say... I'm very grateful to have your support. You've always done your own thing... I never get to see you at the House. But I know you care! An awful lot. So, cheers.

CharonGift01|Charon Gift 01|Zagreus|Charon, you've been such a reassuring sight, I thought I'd offer you a token of my gratitude.
CharonGift01|Charon Gift 01|Charon|*Hrrrhhrooooh*, hnnnn....
CharonGift01|Charon Gift 01|Zagreus|Wait, you don't have to give me something in return, it was a gift! Though, you're insisting, aren't you.
CharonGift02|Charon Gift 02|Charon|Hohhhh....
CharonGift02|Charon Gift 02|Zagreus|Glad you like it, mate. Thank you for helping me out with your supply. Even if you fleece me with those prices!
CharonGift03|Charon Gift 03|Charon|Hrrrnnnn...?
CharonGift03|Charon Gift 03|Zagreus|You enjoy that, mate! And, when it comes time to reconsider your price structure, hope you think of me!
CharonGift04|Charon Gift 04|Charon|*Hrrrn*, hhmmm hmmmm....
CharonGift04|Charon Gift 04|Zagreus|Enjoy it, Charon mate! Don't go thinking I'm just being kind to get you to lower your prices for me, that would be unconscionable!
CharonGift05|Charon Gift 05|Charon|Hrrooooohhh....
CharonGift05|Charon Gift 05|Zagreus|You know, I thought you'd say that, Charon mate, but I insist you take it and enjoy, all right?
CharonGift06|Charon Gift 06|Charon|Hhhrrrrhh... *hhhrrrnnnn*... hrrrrrhhh...
CharonGift06|Charon Gift 06|Zagreus|I'm pleased to have you as a friend as well, Charon. The pleasure's mine.
CharonGift07|Charon Gift 07|Zagreus|Charon, I realize you have a very busy schedule and certainly needn't keep going out of your way for me like this, so here. Just a small token of my appreciation for you. If you ever want to talk, know that I'm here.
CharonGift07|Charon Gift 07|Charon|*Hrrrnnnnnnnnn*...! Thhhrrrrrrrrnnnnnn... kkrrrrrrrrhhh...!
OrpheusFirstMeeting|Orpheus First Meeting|Orpheus|Oh, hello, Zagreus. I understand you liberated me from my eternal punishment. And so I have returned to serve your father here. Thanks.
OrpheusFirstMeeting|Orpheus First Meeting|Zagreus|Orpheus, you're back! Look, don't get on Father's bad side like that and you're going to be fine. Besides... right now I think he's angrier with me.
OrpheusFirstMeeting|Orpheus First Meeting|Orpheus|I grieve for you, my friend. But if you've come to ask me for a song, why, I'm afraid I must stand firm about my answer.
OrpheusFirstMeeting_Alt|Orpheus First Meeting Alt|Orpheus|Oh, hello, Zagreus. I understand you liberated me from my eternal punishment. And so I have returned to serve your father here. Thanks.
OrpheusFirstMeeting_Alt|Orpheus First Meeting Alt|Zagreus|Orpheus, you're back! Look, don't get on Father's bad side like that, and you're going to be fine. I've fought with him enough for all our sakes.
OrpheusFirstMeeting_Alt|Orpheus First Meeting Alt|Orpheus|I grieve for you, my friend. But if you've come to ask me for a song, why, I'm afraid I must stand firm about my answer.
OrpheusMiscMeeting01|Orpheus Misc Meeting 01|Orpheus|Oh, hello Zagreus. I was just wondering if you had ever heard of any other court musicians who had lost the will to sing? Your father's asked me to explain myself and honestly it has been rather difficult.
OrpheusMiscMeeting01|Orpheus Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|If it's any consolation, mate, I'm certain every single undead court musician serving in the throne room of the god of the dead has been through everything you're going through.
OrpheusMiscMeeting02|Orpheus Misc Meeting 02|Orpheus|It's awfully quiet here, you know, when you're out and about? Makes me a bit self-conscious, truth be told, seeing as ostensibly I'm the musician of this court.
OrpheusMiscMeeting02|Orpheus Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|Look, if you decide to start strumming on that lyre again, I'm sure nobody here is going to mind. Though you take care, OK?
OrpheusMiscMeeting03|Orpheus Misc Meeting 03|Orpheus|Oh, hello Zagreus. You look a little down. And so I was just wondering, would you perchance fancy a song right now?
OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|Orpheus, forgive my bluntness here, but I have to ask. Why won't you sing? You were a legend, mate! Our court musician!
OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Orpheus|Why, it's that I have lost my muse, my friend. It isn't harder to explain than that. Have you not had such moments in your life, where you had lost the will to chase your passions?
OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|I, I suppose I have, yeah. But recently I found my drive again, and that's why I have to get out of here.
OrpheusMiscMeeting04|Orpheus Misc Meeting 04|Orpheus|And I am truly happy for you, friend. Alas, I've had no luck in my own search, not that I'm searching any longer, so, I'll just be over here, OK?
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|Anything I can do to help you find your muse, mate?
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Orpheus|I fear my muse is long since lost to me, my friend, though truly thanks for asking. I suppose she must be out there somewhere still, since I once traveled 'cross this land in search of her, and found her then. But that was quite a while back.
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|Wait, you found her? What happened?
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Orpheus|Well, this was back when I was still alive, you understand. Your father, why, he doesn't care for anyone to leave this realm, and, basically now I'm stuck here as well! Not seen her since, and, I'm not much for travel anymore.
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|That's... I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for letting me know. I hope you get to see her again someday.
OrpheusMiscMeeting05|Orpheus Misc Meeting 05|Orpheus|I appreciate the sentiment, my friend, though please don't worry about her or me. I mean, we're dead! We're fine.
OrpheusMiscMeeting06|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06|Zagreus|Mate, if you don't mind, I'd love it if you told me more about your muse.
OrpheusMiscMeeting06|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06|Orpheus|My muse... never has somebody been as splendorous as my Eurydice...! She was so gentle, yet so stout of heart that it would make yours ache, just thinking on it. She inspired innumerable songs of mine.
OrpheusMiscMeeting06|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06|Zagreus|That's quite a few. She sounds like she was a real catch all right. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing your memory of her with me.
OrpheusMiscMeeting06|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06|Orpheus|Thank you for listening, my friend. Eurydice, she likewise used to listen to me all the time....
OrpheusMiscMeeting06_B|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06 B|Zagreus|Mate, if you don't mind, I'd love it if you told me more about your muse.
OrpheusMiscMeeting06_B|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06 B|Orpheus|My muse... never has somebody been as splendorous as my Eurydice...! She was so gentle, yet so stout of heart that it would make yours ache, just thinking on it. She inspired innumerable songs of mine.
OrpheusMiscMeeting06_B|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06 B|Zagreus|Eurydice...? I know a... anyway, she must have been a real catch! I'm sorry for your loss. I have to go look into something here.
OrpheusMiscMeeting06_B|Orpheus Misc Meeting 06 B|Orpheus|Thank you for listening, my friend. Eurydice, she likewise used to listen to me all the time....
OrpheusMiscMeeting07|Orpheus Misc Meeting 07|Orpheus|I understand you've journeyed well beyond the pits of Tartarus, my friend? Another most heroic feat of yours, and truth be told I find it quite inspiring.
OrpheusMiscMeeting07|Orpheus Misc Meeting 07|Zagreus|Inspiring enough to... make you want to sing, again?
OrpheusMiscMeeting07|Orpheus Misc Meeting 07|Orpheus|Oh, that's a rather bold insinuation, Zagreus. I don't know that I've the will for that, I... just, I need some time to think, is that all right?
OrpheusAboutHades01|Orpheus About Hades 01|Zagreus|It sounds like Father's very cross with you, Orpheus. Won't you consider singing once again? You know his threat of further punishment is not a bluff.
OrpheusAboutHades01|Orpheus About Hades 01|Orpheus|Your father can be.... most persuasive, yes, my friend. However, this time, I am... putting my foot down! I have no plans to sing for him again.
OrpheusAboutHades01|Orpheus About Hades 01|Zagreus|Well then how about for me? Or for your other friends among the court?
OrpheusAboutHades01|Orpheus About Hades 01|Orpheus|I... no. Please. My muse is gone to me. I can do no such thing.
OrpheusAboutPressure01|Orpheus About Pressure 01|Orpheus|You seem quite agitated, as of late, my friend. Is anything amiss with you, perhaps?
OrpheusAboutPressure01|Orpheus About Pressure 01|Zagreus|*Oh*! No, I'm all right, Orpheus. Just a lot on my mind is all, sorting out what's next. Stuff I need to work through on my own.
OrpheusAboutPressure01|Orpheus About Pressure 01|Orpheus|Ah, well, I truly understand. I was reluctant to discuss my long-lost muse, really for quite some time. Well, if you do require some emotional support, know that I likely shall be standing over here...
OrpheusAboutHermes01|Orpheus About Hermes 01|Zagreus|Oh, Orpheus? I heard from Hermes, messenger and god of travel, and all that? It's odd *I'm *giving you his message in this case, but he says hey! Admires your musical ability, as well.
OrpheusAboutHermes01|Orpheus About Hermes 01|Orpheus|*Oh*, that was kind of him, my friend! When I first ventured deep into this realm, whilst searching for the soul of my lost muse... after I failed utterly, it was Lord Hermes who whisked her away. It happened so fast. He did an *excellent *job!
OrpheusAboutSinging01|Orpheus About Singing 01|Zagreus|I always meant to ask you, Orpheus. Where did you learn to sing like that? Was it really Apollo himself who taught you?
OrpheusAboutSinging01|Orpheus About Singing 01|Orpheus|*Oh*, why, I learned from many different sources, Zagreus. That is before all of my inspiration started coming from a single source. I credit my accomplishments to her, and to Apollo, and the gods. And to considerable time spent practicing!
OrpheusAboutNyx01|Orpheus About Nyx 01|Zagreus|Orpheus? I know Father appreciates your songs, to the extent he's capable of appreciating anything. Though, has Nyx ever responded to them? She's always right nearby yet you two don't seem to talk...
OrpheusAboutNyx01|Orpheus About Nyx 01|Orpheus|Almighty Nyx appears to tolerate my presence, Zagreus. For she could cast me into everlasting darkness if my song failed to be pleasing to her. She is a most-discerning listener!
OrpheusAboutMusicStand01|Orpheus About Music Stand 01|Orpheus|Are you the one whom I should thank for this most wondrous music stand, my friend? Why, it is positively splendid, isn't it?
OrpheusAboutMusicStand01|Orpheus About Music Stand 01|Zagreus|Our renowned court musician ought to have the finest means available, I think. I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus. Though, tell me something, how can it play your music when you're not even here?
OrpheusAboutMusicStand01|Orpheus About Music Stand 01|Orpheus|Who can explain the secret art of Daedalus, my friend? Know only that, whenever it produces music for your listening enjoyment, that the sound you hear is coming from my soul!
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|So, I am quite confused, I must admit, my friend. The Queen Persephone, she is your mother, then? How is it that she came to reside, here?
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Well, *erm*... it all started when my father saw her on Olympus, and... they fell madly in love. He swept her off her feet, and brought her here. The Olympians, they got pretty worried when they saw she was gone. But now it's OK! Everything's out in the open.
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|But, surely the Queen's mother on Olympus, the great goddess Demeter... surely she would quite like it if she saw her daughter still, from time to time?
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Oh, that! Thing is, Mother ate some... pomegranate seeds when she was here. And we have rules about that stuff, you know! It means she cannot leave this place for very long at all. I'm sure Demeter will understand. And unfreeze everything when her daughter's around.
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|Ah, yes, pomegranate seeds, of course, of course! Though, there is one more subject I don't understand, which is... how *you *fit into all of this. Were you not trying to escape from here?
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Forget about me, Orpheus! This isn't about me, it's about Mother. What's important is she's here, where she belongs.
OrpheusPostEpilogue01|Orpheus Post Epilogue 01|Orpheus|I see! I understand. Well, thank you, then, for clearing all that up. It is a splendid tale, I must say, and every part of it makes sense to me, at last.
OrpheusSingsAgain01|Orpheus Sings Again 01|Orpheus|I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.
OrpheusSingsAgain01|Orpheus Sings Again 01|Zagreus|This is amazing, mate. So does this mean you found your muse?
OrpheusSingsAgain01|Orpheus Sings Again 01|Orpheus|Oh no, I never found my muse, my friend. It's just... seeing you carrying on like this time after time, I was reminded I ought to get on with my life, too, such as it is right now.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_B|Orpheus Sings Again 01 B|Orpheus|I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_B|Orpheus Sings Again 01 B|Zagreus|This is amazing, mate. You sing quite beautifully, with or without your muse.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_B|Orpheus Sings Again 01 B|Orpheus|How kind of you. It's just... seeing you carry on like this, time after time, I was reminded that I might as well get on with my existence, too. Such as it is right now.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_C|Orpheus Sings Again 01 C|Orpheus|I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_C|Orpheus Sings Again 01 C|Zagreus|It's beautiful, mate. If only Eurydice could hear you right now.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_C|Orpheus Sings Again 01 C|Orpheus|How kind of you, my friend. It's just... seeing you carry on like this, time after time, I was reminded I ought to get on with my existence, too. Such as it is right now.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_D|Orpheus Sings Again 01 D|Orpheus|I became so enthralled with song once more, my friend, that I have been inspired to compose another one. For old time's sake, perhaps.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_D|Orpheus Sings Again 01 D|Zagreus|This is amazing, mate. You sing quite beautifully, with or without your muse.
OrpheusSingsAgain01_D|Orpheus Sings Again 01 D|Orpheus|How kind of you, although... my voice is nothing but the crunch of gravel underfoot compared to hers, which soars as though on wings.
OrpheusTallTale01|Orpheus Tall Tale 01|Zagreus|Say, Orpheus? I ever tell you I once single-handedly slew a multi-headed bone hydra within the magma fields of Asphodel without so much as breaking a sweat?
OrpheusTallTale01|Orpheus Tall Tale 01|Orpheus|My, that is wonderful to hear, my friend! Another in a litany of such heroic deeds, more noble than the heroes of our verse, and even great Achilles over there!
OrpheusTallTale01|Orpheus Tall Tale 01|Zagreus|I'm glad you think so, mate! These tales of my valorous accomplishments do seem to cheer you up, so, I will keep reporting back once I rack up some more.
OrpheusTallTale02|Orpheus Tall Tale 02|Zagreus|Hey Orpheus? You know about the time I vanquished seven legions of Bloodless warriors with both hands tied behind my back while hopping on one foot? Lord Poseidon dared me to do it, you know.
OrpheusTallTale02|Orpheus Tall Tale 02|Orpheus|Why, that is a spectacularly vivid tale, Zagreus, and most deserving to be chronicled in song! Would that there were a poet here still willing to commit such deeds to verse.
OrpheusTallTale03|Orpheus Tall Tale 03|Zagreus|Hey, Orpheus? I take it you know all about the time I burned my father's hands to a crisp the moment I was born? He grasped me by the feet, and they caught fire! And that's why he still wears those fancy rings: to cover up the hideous scar tissue.
OrpheusTallTale03|Orpheus Tall Tale 03|Orpheus|But that is such a splendid tale, Zagreus, deserving to be sung both far and wide, until it turns into the stuff of myth, as deathless as the gods themselves! I'll gladly tell that one about!
OrpheusTallTale04|Orpheus Tall Tale 04|Zagreus|Hey Orpheus, you've noticed the resemblance between me and Dionysus, haven't you, mate? I'll tell you a little secret but you have to promise not to tell... We're really the same god. I love a good feast, don't I?
OrpheusTallTale04|Orpheus Tall Tale 04|Orpheus|But, Zagreus, that is a striking revelation, the connection you describe. I see it! I can see it now! To think the god of wine and you are intricately linked, it isn't obvious, is it?
OrpheusTallTale04|Orpheus Tall Tale 04|Zagreus|Oh, there's more to it! A bit grim, really, as I'm a little older than I look. You see, the Titans, they once tore me limb from limb, but then my heart was saved, and that's where Dionysus comes from! That is the connection between us, you understand me, mate?
OrpheusTallTale04|Orpheus Tall Tale 04|Orpheus|Your tale stirs my soul, it truly does, my friend. It is a marvel to me that such heroism isn't widely known, and I'm committed to the spread of all such truths.
OrpheusTallTale05|Orpheus Tall Tale 05|Zagreus|Hey Orpheus, you know I've just been messing with you, with those Dionysus tales, and all that? Just trying to liven things up for us, mate.
OrpheusTallTale05|Orpheus Tall Tale 05|Orpheus|Oh, Zagreus! There isn't need for such humility, not when one's deeds of heroism are as great and numerous as yours! It is an honor to have heard such deeds first-hand!
OrpheusTallTale06|Orpheus Tall Tale 06|Zagreus|You know, mate, sometimes I worry that you're taking my tall tales rather seriously. You're not really going about and telling everyone this stuff, are you?
OrpheusTallTale06|Orpheus Tall Tale 06|Orpheus|Come now, my friend! I know this is a test of faith! Of course I am committed to the spread of such heroic deeds as yours. And I do so enjoy getting to hear them first!
OrpheusTallTale07|Orpheus Tall Tale 07|Zagreus|Hey, Orpheus? I figure that you've heard by now about how I bested the Minotaur Asterius, alongside Theseus, the Champion of Elysium, himself? I don't think I even broke a sweat.
OrpheusTallTale07|Orpheus Tall Tale 07|Orpheus|I scarce can possibly imagine such a spectacle, my friend! But certainly I shall attempt to try!
OrpheusTallTale08|Orpheus Tall Tale 08|Zagreus|Orpheus, you have to hear this straight from me. I vanquished my own father, on the outskirts of the Temple of Styx. At the surface! I know how this looks, since I'm back here, and so is he. You believe me, don't you?
OrpheusTallTale08|Orpheus Tall Tale 08|Orpheus|Of *course *I do, my friend! Though, you must know, your father has requested his relationship to you be kept quite clandestine. You'll understand if I not sing your praises in this case, won't you?
OrpheusSingsAgain02|Orpheus Sings Again 02|Zagreus|Orpheus, sorry to interrupt, it's just... I couldn't help but notice that new ballad that you're playing, there.
OrpheusSingsAgain02|Orpheus Sings Again 02|Orpheus|Technically, one ought consider it a hymn, my friend! In honor of your numerous travails, prior to your current set of circumstances, which must pale in comparison to all the rigors you've endured to date!
OrpheusSingsAgain02|Orpheus Sings Again 02|Zagreus|*Erm*, the thing is... none of the information in your hymn is accurate. It's nonsense. I was just kidding with you, mate! I tried to make that clear. You get so lively when I tell you my tall tales, you know? You're not angry with me, are you...?
OrpheusSingsAgain02|Orpheus Sings Again 02|Orpheus|Heavens, no, my friend! Your humility is matched only by your perseverance in the face of adversity! May your great deeds live on forever, much like you!
OrpheusAboutEurydice01|Orpheus About Eurydice 01|Zagreus|Say, Orpheus. You wouldn't happen to know the nymph Eurydice, would you? Tall, woodsy type? I get the impression maybe you know each other.
OrpheusAboutEurydice01|Orpheus About Eurydice 01|Orpheus|*What*? Why... yes. I know Eurydice. Or, I once knew her, I should say. Whyever would you ask me such a thing, my friend?
OrpheusAboutEurydice01|Orpheus About Eurydice 01|Zagreus|I saw her, mate. In Asphodel. She's doing fine up there! All on her own. The two of you, you used to know each other, then?
OrpheusAboutEurydice01|Orpheus About Eurydice 01|Orpheus|We more than knew each other, Zagreus. We were husband and wife. She was my muse. To think that we are doomed to be apart during our afterlives. Ah, well!
OrpheusAboutEurydice01|Orpheus About Eurydice 01|Zagreus|*Ah, well*? Don't you have a message I could bring to her, if we should meet again? Something like that?
OrpheusAboutEurydice01|Orpheus About Eurydice 01|Orpheus|I do not wish to trouble her again, my friend. Speak not to her of me, all right? I have my memory of her; it is enough.
OrpheusAboutEurydice01_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 01 B|Zagreus|Say, Orpheus. You're not going to believe this. I happened on a certain nymph during my journeys recently. It was Eurydice. Tall, woodsy type?
OrpheusAboutEurydice01_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 01 B|Orpheus|*What*? Why... truly. I knew Eurydice resided in your father's realm, but... I had not anticipated you would cross her path. You're certain of this, then?
OrpheusAboutEurydice01_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 01 B|Zagreus|I saw her, mate. In Asphodel. She's doing fine up there! All on her own. You said the two of you were very close, isn't that right?
OrpheusAboutEurydice01_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 01 B|Orpheus|We were much more than that, Zagreus. We were husband and wife. She was my muse. To think that we are doomed to be apart during our afterlives. Ah, well!
OrpheusAboutEurydice01_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 01 B|Zagreus|*Ah, well*? Don't you have a message I could bring to her, if we should meet again? Something like that?
OrpheusAboutEurydice01_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 01 B|Orpheus|I do not wish to trouble her again, my friend. Speak not to her of me, all right? I have my memory of her; it is enough.
OrpheusAboutEurydice02|Orpheus About Eurydice 02|Zagreus|Orpheus, I saw Eurydice again. I... couldn't bring myself to do exactly as you asked, I... sort of mentioned you.
OrpheusAboutEurydice02|Orpheus About Eurydice 02|Orpheus|You *what*?! Or, what I meant to say was: Oh. Did you perchance get the impression she yet harbors toward me feelings of resentment, and the like?
OrpheusAboutEurydice02|Orpheus About Eurydice 02|Zagreus|You seemed to be a bit of a sore subject, yes. What happened to the two of you, if I may ask?
OrpheusAboutEurydice02|Orpheus About Eurydice 02|Orpheus|Oh, it's just... I almost saved her soul from this domain, back when I lived and breathed. But in the final moments of my rescue, my faith faltered. She is lost to me forever, now. Though, I'm pleased to hear she isn't lost to you!
OrpheusAboutEurydice02_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 02 B|Zagreus|Orpheus, I saw Eurydice again. I... couldn't bring myself to do exactly as you asked, I... sort of mentioned you.
OrpheusAboutEurydice02_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 02 B|Orpheus|You *what*?! Or, what I meant to say was: Oh. Did you perchance get the impression she yet harbors toward me feelings of resentment, and the like?
OrpheusAboutEurydice02_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 02 B|Zagreus|You seemed to be a bit of a sore subject, yes. You really almost freed her from the Underworld, huh?
OrpheusAboutEurydice02_B|Orpheus About Eurydice 02 B|Orpheus|Almost, my friend, almost. But in the final moments of my rescue, my faith faltered. She is lost to me forever, now. Though, I'm pleased to hear she isn't lost to you!
OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Orpheus|Pray tell me something, Zagreus. How is she lately, hm? Eurydice, I mean. Her hair, fall colors, or full bloom? Her poise, as proud and supple as the oak?
OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Zagreus|She's all right, Orpheus. Seems comfortable within her little place in Asphodel. The only thing that seems to bother her at all is... when I mention you. Is there nothing you can do to patch things up?
OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Orpheus|Alas, I cannot change the past, my friend. So, no. As you can plainly see by now, I'm dead to her. Rightfully so, at that.
OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Zagreus|But that's just a technicality! I mean, you're here, she's there! So what if you're not breathing anymore, you have all eternity ahead of you. Don't you want to see her again?
OrpheusAboutEurydice03|Orpheus About Eurydice 03|Orpheus|Don't I want to see my Eurydice again...? Why, yes. That, more than anything, my friend. Provided she wanted to see me. I tried once to disturb her everlasting rest, as you well know. And that did not pan out as I had hoped....
OrpheusAboutEurydice04|Orpheus About Eurydice 04|Orpheus|What news of late about Eurydice, my friend? She is as delicate as I described, no doubt? *Ah*, but... I am dwelling on her once again, it seems.
OrpheusAboutEurydice04|Orpheus About Eurydice 04|Zagreus|I knew she was a talented musician, mate, but you never let on that she is an amazing chef, as well. She's been hospitable to me each time we've met. Though you still seem to be a bit of a sore subject.
OrpheusAboutEurydice04|Orpheus About Eurydice 04|Orpheus|How very understandable, indeed. Were I to have been failed to be rescued from the depths of hell, mere moments from escape, I too would be quite cross with my attempted rescuer. And for quite some time.
OrpheusAboutEurydice05|Orpheus About Eurydice 05|Zagreus|Orpheus, I don't suppose you know how come I keep running into Eurydice in particular out there? For all the shades resting eternally in Asphodel, it seems beyond coincidence I always find the one that's dear to you.
OrpheusAboutEurydice05|Orpheus About Eurydice 05|Orpheus|I have no knowledge of the weavings of the Fates, my friend. Perhaps they trample on what used to be my heart for leisure or for sport, do you suppose?
OrpheusAboutEurydice06|Orpheus About Eurydice 06|Zagreus|Say, Orpheus, Eurydice told me your songs, some of them came from her? She seems quite brilliant. You choose your muses well!
OrpheusAboutEurydice06|Orpheus About Eurydice 06|Orpheus|I owe my everything to my Eurydice. She authored many of my songs, indeed; and she inspired many, many more. Whilst living, we collaborated frequently, you see.
OrpheusAboutEurydice06|Orpheus About Eurydice 06|Zagreus|But weren't you the famous one? I don't understand why she doesn't share your renown.
OrpheusAboutEurydice06|Orpheus About Eurydice 06|Orpheus|It is but one of life's injustices, I fear. I always sang her praises every chance I had. And she asserted herself splendidly. Yet even still, our listeners believed our songs, they came from me... what else could I have done?
OrpheusAboutEurydice06|Orpheus About Eurydice 06|Zagreus|I don't exactly know the ways of mortals, mate. But I'm pleased to hear you always giving credit where it's due.
OrpheusAboutEurydice06Extra|Orpheus About Eurydice 06 Extra|Zagreus|Orpheus, you said that it was one of life's injustices that Eurydice doesn't get her fair share of the credit for the songs she wrote. Isn't there something we can do?
OrpheusAboutEurydice06Extra|Orpheus About Eurydice 06 Extra|Orpheus|Why, I don't know, my friend. Once people set their minds to certain things... it can be difficult to show them other possibilities exist. What's to be done?
OrpheusAboutEurydice06Extra|Orpheus About Eurydice 06 Extra|Zagreus|I don't know... tell them they're wrong? Politely, perhaps not? Or... tell them what's right. Get the word out about what's right? Can't we do that?
OrpheusAboutEurydice06Extra|Orpheus About Eurydice 06 Extra|Orpheus|Get the word out...? But I am court musician of this House. My songs no longer reach too many ears. Although... I do suppose all of these shades about... they are my audience, as well. I shall make certain that they know whose songs I sing.
OrpheusProgressWithEurydice01|Duo - Progress and Eurydice (1)|Orpheus|I must confess something to you, my friend. My mind still wanders to Eurydice quite often, and my memories of her. Despite my best attempts to move along with my existence here. I would call it a fatal flaw, except, I am already dead.
OrpheusProgressWithEurydice01|Duo - Progress and Eurydice (1)|Zagreus|Don't torture yourself, mate. You've been through enough. As has she! You still care for one another just don't have a way to get the point across. But I have an idea.
OrpheusProgressWithEurydice01|Duo - Progress and Eurydice (1)|Orpheus|I, too, once had ideas, Zagreus. --eas, and inspirations. It was so very wonderful, to have a muse...
OrpheusProgressWithEurydice02|Duo - Progress and Eurydice (2)|Zagreus|I got you something, Orpheus. It's a new song. From someone who still cares for you.
OrpheusProgressWithEurydice02|Duo - Progress and Eurydice (2)|Orpheus|My friend, you wrote a song, for me...? Oh, but this is not from you, it's from... *Eurydice*... I, no, I don't know what to say, I... I...
OrpheusSingsAgain03|Orpheus Sings Again 03|Zagreus|You sing beautifully, mate. If only Eurydice could hear you singing this right now.
OrpheusSingsAgain03|Orpheus Sings Again 03|Orpheus|Oh. Thanks for the sentiment, my friend, it's just... when I sing this song of hers, why, I've this feeling where my heart once was that, well... perhaps she *can*.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Orpheus|Zagreus! The most amazing circumstances have occurred. The terms of my employment, they've been altered such that... I may visit Asphodel sometimes. May visit *her*.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|That's great! Orpheus, what are you waiting for, mate? Go and find your muse out there! You two have lots to catch up on, I think.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Orpheus|I think you're right. I am so very anxious, I must say. But I must also thank you, for this opportunity, and... for speaking with me all this time. So, how might I repay you?
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Why is it always talk of payment around here? You're my mate. And your songs have lifted many spirits here, including mine. Now go, and make the most of this, will you?
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|Hey Orpheus, you're back! How was your trip? I hope it was all right.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Orpheus|It was more than all right, my friend. Why, it was positively inspirational. But I've returned as promised to this House. My love is there, whilst my responsibilities are here.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|You sound despondent again, mate. You must wish you were there right now. I'm sorry you had to come all the way back.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Orpheus|Oh, on the contrary, Zagreus. It dawned upon me that having some distance between my responsibilities and my domestic life, why... it is not so bad. Besides, Charon makes travel to and fro quite simple for me, really.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete02|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 02|Zagreus|I have to ask you something, Orpheus. It seems like everything has been all right for you, except... you don't look very happy to me, mate. Is everything all right? Between you and Eurydice, I mean?
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete02|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 02|Orpheus|Oh, *haha*, but your concern is much appreciated, friend. I feel I am in everlasting bliss. It simply does not show upon my countenance. Perhaps through song is how I best express myself.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete03|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03|Zagreus|Hey, Orpheus. You know I'm very happy that things turned out well between you and Eurydice, but... looking back, I think I might have overstepped my bounds with you a bit, and wanted to say I'm sorry.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete03|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03|Orpheus|You're sorry, Zagreus? Whatever for? If not for you, I fear I never would have seen my muse again.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete03|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03|Zagreus|Well, it's just... when I met her, and I found out the two of you were having problems, I... well, I just wanted to see you patch things up. But, it wasn't any of my business, and you never asked my help. Neither did she. I could have made things worse.
OrpheusAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete03|Orpheus About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03|Orpheus|But, you didn't make things worse, my friend. And... truth be told, I do not think I ever would have asked for help, at any point, because... I don't entirely know how. So I am grateful to you, and your generous instinct.
OrpheusPostEnding01|Orpheus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Say, Orpheus! I heard what must have been a song of yours, it went *something, something, in the blood*, you know that one? It was amazing, mate.
OrpheusPostEnding01|Orpheus Post Ending 01|Orpheus|Oh, that one, yes, I know! I mean, it was a favorite, I was told, by those who listened to the music I created with my muse. It was a most productive time, back when we were alive!
OrpheusPostEnding01|Orpheus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Would you ever sing it again?
OrpheusAboutDistantMemory01|Orpheus About Distant Memory 01|Zagreus|Hey, Orpheus. The keepsake that you gave me... it's come in useful, thanks. I can't quite see what's in the container, though. I shouldn't open it, should I?
OrpheusAboutDistantMemory01|Orpheus About Distant Memory 01|Orpheus|No, Zagreus. Unless of course you wanted to set loose a cherished living memory of mine, and take from me that fleeting bit of joy?
OrpheusAboutDistantMemory02|Orpheus About Distant Memory 02|Zagreus|Orpheus, the Distant Memory you gave me... it's a bit of your past with Eurydice in there, isn't it. I'm grateful, but... why give me such a precious gift as that?
OrpheusAboutDistantMemory02|Orpheus About Distant Memory 02|Orpheus|I'm glad you like it, Zagreus. Some memories are cherished, yes, indeed. But there can come a point where they provide more benefit to others than ourselves. Don't you agree?
OrpheusAboutMusicPlaying01|Orpheus About Music Playing 01|Orpheus|Have you considered doing music-making as a recreational pursuit, my friend? You have such slender hands, why, I believe you'd do quite well at it.
OrpheusAboutMusicPlaying01|Orpheus About Music Playing 01|Zagreus|Not really been at the top of my list of late, mate, but who knows. It's something I've been meaning to try at some point, I suppose. Thanks for the words of encouragement!
OrpheusMusicProgress01|Orpheus Music Progress 01|Zagreus|Hey Orpheus! I got myself a lyre much like yours, except I'm absolutely miserable when I try to play! Got any advice?
OrpheusMusicProgress01|Orpheus Music Progress 01|Orpheus|Oh, why, that's splendid, Zagreus. And I can certainly show you a thing or two. First, the proper posture is important, here...
OrpheusMusicProgress01|Orpheus Music Progress 01|Orpheus|...now remember to practice the plucking technique which I taught you, and mind your off-hand constantly. And, above all, continue practicing! The joyfulness is in the practicing itself.
OrpheusMusicProgress02|Orpheus Music Progress 02|Orpheus|Zagreus, I heard your recent lyre-playing from your bedchambers. Let no one lead you to believe it's not a reassuring start.
OrpheusMusicProgress02|Orpheus Music Progress 02|Zagreus|Oh, come now, mate, I'm terrible and you know it. You pulling one over on me as payback?
OrpheusMusicProgress02|Orpheus Music Progress 02|Orpheus|I'm being serious, my friend. It is a challenging pursuit requiring a dedicated state of mind. The progress shall come. You shall discover what I mean.
OrpheusMusicProgress03|Orpheus Music Progress 03|Orpheus|Your music-playing has improved substantially. Perhaps in time you shall surpass my own abilities!
OrpheusMusicProgress03|Orpheus Music Progress 03|Zagreus|I highly doubt that, mate, though thanks for noticing. Creating music's quite rewarding once you get the hang of it!
OrpheusMusicProgress04|Orpheus Music Progress 04|Orpheus|I must commend you on the most splendid lyre-playing emanating from your bedchambers, my friend. It seems we have a second court musician, now.
OrpheusMusicProgress04|Orpheus Music Progress 04|Zagreus|Thank you for encouraging me to give it a shot, mate. And for the kind words.
OrpheusWithHades01|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (1)|Orpheus|...You called upon your humble court musician, as I understand, Lord Hades sir? Referring to myself of course?
OrpheusWithHades01|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (1)|Hades|Well, Orpheus... if you're quite finished with your little stint within the depths of Tartarus, I'd like to ask again: Play us a song, already. Or else next time I'll not be quite so charitable with your punishment.
OrpheusWithHades01|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (1)|Orpheus|Oh, that. I must apologize, again, Lord Hades sir. For I'm afraid that I've no wish to sing as yet. In spite of your persuasiveness even. And, that, um, is my final word upon the subject. At this time.
OrpheusWithHades01|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (1)|Hades|Is that so...? Why, then, I'll go ahead and wait. I've all the patience in the world.
OrpheusWithHades02|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (2)|Hades|Help me to understand something here, Orpheus. Why do I bother keeping such a worthless shadow of a court musician in my House? You prattle ceaselessly, yet I can't get even a single note out of you?
OrpheusWithHades02|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (2)|Orpheus|If I may be so bold, my lord? Perhaps the merest sight of me still stirs in you a memory of my performances of yore. It gladdens me you used to like my songs.
OrpheusWithHades02|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (2)|Hades|I used to tolerate your insolence. We're finished here. You find your voice. Immediately! You have one hundred years, and not a moment more.
OrpheusWithHades03|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (3)|Hades|Finally returned to your senses, haven't you, Orpheus. A court musician who refused to sing! Such nonsense. I trust there shall be no more insubordination from you, moving forward?
OrpheusWithHades03|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (3)|Orpheus|I'm gladdened that my songs yet stir your soul, my lord. But, I have to confess my choice to sing again was motivated largely by the Prince. And by my muse, of course.
OrpheusWithHades03|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (3)|Hades|Still going on about your so-called muse, I see. You had your chance with Eurydice. You squandered it. And now you're here; a deal is a deal. I expect you to comply with your end of our agreement.
OrpheusWithHades04|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (4)|Orpheus|...I'm pleased to know my new, more flexible arrangement remains to your satisfaction, still, my lord. I must admit I feared that my departure would result once more in a protracted stay within the pits of Tartarus.
OrpheusWithHades04|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (4)|Hades|Don't give me such ideas, Orpheus! Instead, you go about your business, there, and play your blasted songs when circumstances call for it.
OrpheusWithHades04|Duo - Orpheus and Hades (4)|Orpheus|I shall be happy to oblige, my lord. Eurydice and I are grateful for your magnanimity.
OrpheusWithAchilles01|Duo - Orpheus and Achilles (1)|Orpheus|...You're much too modest, Lord Achilles, for someone with such a number of heroic deeds and glorious decapitations to his name! You ought to be more like ever-boastful Zagreus, and talk it up some more!
OrpheusWithAchilles01|Duo - Orpheus and Achilles (1)|Achilles|Oh, fear not, Orpheus, I was quite boastful in my day. And would you look at where it got me? Besides, I've not the imagination to come up with tales as tall as those of our Prince Zagreus.
OrpheusWithAchilles02|Duo - Orpheus and Achilles (2)|Orpheus|...Do you miss it, yourself, Lord Achilles, sir? The freshness of the air. The need to have meals several times a day, and such.
OrpheusWithAchilles02|Duo - Orpheus and Achilles (2)|Achilles|I scarce remember it, my friend. Although your songs do stir up memories, sometimes. I'm used to things the way they are, I think. But you, not so much?
OrpheusWithAchilles02|Duo - Orpheus and Achilles (2)|Orpheus|Oh, on the contrary, sir, I am profoundly satisfied. We are most fortunate to have employment even after death. Imagine, merely resting for eternity, when you could work!
OrpheusWithPersephone01|Duo - Orpheus and Persephone (1)|Persephone|...*Ah*, but to think that our esteemed musician of the court is none other than *you*, Orpheus! In matters of music, at least, Hades and I have similar tastes. Anyway, I don't mean to keep you!
OrpheusWithPersephone01|Duo - Orpheus and Persephone (1)|Orpheus|I shall be honored to perform my songs, Your Grace. And, might I add, Your Grace bears many of the striking features of your son? I understand now where he gets his charm.
OrpheusChat01|Orpheus Chat 01|Orpheus|I'm sorry I've no will for singing, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat02|Orpheus Chat 02|Orpheus|I feel a bit self-conscious seeing as I must refuse to sing...!
OrpheusChat03|Orpheus Chat 03|Orpheus|I remain your humble court musician, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat04|Orpheus Chat 04|Orpheus|I'm truly pleased to see you, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat05|Orpheus Chat 05|Orpheus|Would that I could aid you in some way, my friend.
OrpheusChat06|Orpheus Chat 06|Orpheus|It's awfully quiet whilst you're not around. Still rather quiet now!
OrpheusChat07|Orpheus Chat 07|Orpheus|Nice speaking with you, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat08|Orpheus Chat 08|Orpheus|I'm afraid I haven't much to say on this occasion, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat09|Orpheus Chat 09|Orpheus|I hope your day or night, I guess, is going nicely, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat10|Orpheus Chat 10|Orpheus|Please do be careful out there, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat11|Orpheus Chat 11|Orpheus|I wish I could direct you towards a much more lively court musician.
OrpheusChat12|Orpheus Chat 12|Orpheus|Normally I'd offer up a song for such occasions, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat13|Orpheus Chat 13|Orpheus|Be strong out there, my friend, OK?
OrpheusChat14|Orpheus Chat 14|Orpheus|I'm cheering for you all the way, my friend.
OrpheusChat15|Orpheus Chat 15|Orpheus|Good luck to you out in that deadly hellscape, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat16|Orpheus Chat 16|Orpheus|Thank you for checking up on me, my friend, although I'm quite all right.
OrpheusChat17|Orpheus Chat 17|Orpheus|I'm still fresh out of songs or will to sing them, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat18|Orpheus Chat 18|Orpheus|I'd ask if you remember what it's like to feel inspired, my friend, but I don't want to know.
OrpheusChat19|Orpheus Chat 19|Orpheus|Oh, hello, Zagreus....
OrpheusNonSingingChat08|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 08|Orpheus|I pray the Fates not ruin all your dreams as they did mine!
OrpheusNonSingingChat01|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 01|Orpheus|May you emerge from all of this unscathed, my friend.
OrpheusNonSingingChat02|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 02|Orpheus|I trust your neverending toil in the Underworld is proceeding well, my friend?
OrpheusNonSingingChat03|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 03|Orpheus|I have an optimistic feeling about your next attempt to run away, my friend!
OrpheusNonSingingChat04|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 04|Orpheus|May you yet find your muse somewhere out there, my friend.
OrpheusNonSingingChat05|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 05|Orpheus|Each failure brings new opportunities for self-reflection, right, my friend?
OrpheusNonSingingChat06|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 06|Orpheus|Please keep me well apprised of all of your incredible achievements, Zagreus.
OrpheusNonSingingChat07|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 07|Orpheus|It lifts my spirits when we briefly interact, my friend.
OrpheusNonSingingChat08|Orpheus Non Singing Chat 08|Orpheus|I pray the Fates not ruin all your dreams as they did mine!
OrpheusChat21|Orpheus Chat 21|Orpheus|I'd best get back to singing, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat22|Orpheus Chat 22|Orpheus|Let's talk when I'm not singing, Zagreus?
OrpheusChat23|Orpheus Chat 23|Orpheus|Hello, my friend, let's get back to my song?
OrpheusChat24|Orpheus Chat 24|Orpheus|I'm kind of singing at the moment, Zagreus.
OrpheusChat25|Orpheus Chat 25|Orpheus|Terribly sorry I can't speak with you right now.
OrpheusChat26|Orpheus Chat 26|Orpheus|I thought I'd lost even the gift of music, Zagreus. So, thanks again for helping find that one for me!
OrpheusChat27|Orpheus Chat 27|Orpheus|I must say, it's nice having some music in my life again, and hopefully in yours!
OrpheusChat28|Orpheus Chat 28|Orpheus|We all could use a little song from time to time, isn't that so?
OrpheusChat29|Orpheus Chat 29|Orpheus|It's nice that I no longer have to live and breathe, and can be focused purely on my song...!
OrpheusChat30|Orpheus Chat 30|Orpheus|You rescued me from an eternity of not getting to sing, my friend.
OrpheusMaxChat01|Orpheus Max Chat 01|Orpheus|I hope your day or night is just as splendid as my own, my friend.
OrpheusMaxChat02|Orpheus Max Chat 02|Orpheus|I pray the Fates fulfill your dreams as they did mine!
OrpheusMaxChat03|Orpheus Max Chat 03|Orpheus|Oh, Zagreus, how wonderful to see you once again!
OrpheusMaxChat04|Orpheus Max Chat 04|Orpheus|I was just thinking of you, Zagreus.
OrpheusMaxChat05|Orpheus Max Chat 05|Orpheus|My greetings to my very dearest friend.
OrpheusSingingChat01|Orpheus Singing Chat 01|Orpheus|I am in concert as perhaps you see, my friend!
OrpheusSingingChat02|Orpheus Singing Chat 02|Orpheus|Begging your pardon, Zagreus, but I'm amid performance at this time!
OrpheusSingingChat03|Orpheus Singing Chat 03|Orpheus|I'm quite preoccupied with singing all your praises, Zagreus!
OrpheusSingingChat04|Orpheus Singing Chat 04|Orpheus|This hymn is dedicated to your deeds, my friend!
OrpheusSingingChat05|Orpheus Singing Chat 05|Orpheus|I cannot talk right now, my friend, for I must sing!
OrpheusSingingChat06|Orpheus Singing Chat 06|Orpheus|I trust my music brings some lightness to our gloom-filled times, my friend?
OrpheusSingingChat07|Orpheus Singing Chat 07|Orpheus|The tale of your birth is so complex, my friend!
OrpheusSingingChat08|Orpheus Singing Chat 08|Orpheus|I ask you please hold your applause until the end!
OrpheusSingingChat09|Orpheus Singing Chat 09|Orpheus|To think Lord Dionysus and yourself share such a bond!
OrpheusSingingChat09|Orpheus Singing Chat 09|Orpheus|May my performances spread wide your fame, my friend!
OrpheusSingingChat10|Orpheus Singing Chat 10|Orpheus|Your parentage need not be secret any longer, Zagreus!
OrpheusSingingChat11|Orpheus Singing Chat 11|Orpheus|I shall keep singing of your praises, far and wide!
OrpheusSingingChat12|Orpheus Singing Chat 12|Orpheus|You've helped inspire me to song, my friend!
OrpheusSingingChat13|Orpheus Singing Chat 13|Orpheus|I must stay focused on my singing, Zagreus.
OrpheusSingingChat14|Orpheus Singing Chat 14|Orpheus|I trust my hymn provides some solace to your days or nights?
OrpheusEurydiceSingingChat01|Orpheus Eurydice Singing Chat 01|Orpheus|My muse writes absolutely wondrous songs, don't you agree?
OrpheusEurydiceSingingChat02|Orpheus Eurydice Singing Chat 02|Orpheus|*Ah*, this reminds me so of my Eurydice...
OrpheusEurydiceSingingChat03|Orpheus Eurydice Singing Chat 03|Orpheus|Would that I were together with her now...
OrpheusEurydiceSingingChat04|Orpheus Eurydice Singing Chat 04|Orpheus|The songs of my Eurydice are without peer...
OrpheusEurydiceSingingChat05|Orpheus Eurydice Singing Chat 05|Orpheus|This is a favorite song of mine, and perhaps yours?
OrpheusGift01|Orpheus Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey, mate, here. I got this for my favorite court musician.
OrpheusGift01|Orpheus Gift 01|Orpheus|Oh, my, but you can't simply be this kind to me without retaliation on my part, my friend! And so, in turn, I have a gift for you!
OrpheusGift02|Orpheus Gift 02|Orpheus|Why, this is absolutely splendid, Zagreus. Is this really for me? It's so very kind of you to think of me like this.
OrpheusGift02|Orpheus Gift 02|Zagreus|I want you to have it, Orpheus. You've brightened up our lives down here more than you know. I only wish that you could see that.
OrpheusGift03|Orpheus Gift 03|Orpheus|*Oh*, why! I'm very much obliged that you have thought of me again, for such a wonderfully thoughtful gift!
OrpheusGift03|Orpheus Gift 03|Zagreus|It's nothing, Orpheus. Thank you for all the inspiration through your song. I love your work, mate.
OrpheusGift04|Orpheus Gift 04|Orpheus|You're always much too kind, you know, my friend? Now typically I would express my gratitude through song, except, you understand, don't you?
OrpheusGift04|Orpheus Gift 04|Zagreus|I understand completely, Orpheus. I think we'll both get through this rough patch in due time.
OrpheusGift04_B|Orpheus Gift 04 B|Orpheus|You always offer means to quench my thirst, my friend. A wonder that I have such feelings, even now.
OrpheusGift04_B|Orpheus Gift 04 B|Zagreus|Now that you've started singing once again, I figured it was thirst-inducing work! Your music stirs so many souls around here, mate.
OrpheusGift05|Orpheus Gift 05|Zagreus|Hey, mate! What do you say we share this over in the lounge?
OrpheusGift05|Orpheus Gift 05|Orpheus|Oh, I, certainly, why, I don't see why not. I mean, it's not as though I've got something to do that isn't that.
OrpheusGift05|Orpheus Gift 05|Orpheus|...And, anyways, I oughtn't have looked back, I mean, the moral of the story is to not look back when you are told not to look back, you understand, don't you, my friend?
OrpheusGift05|Orpheus Gift 05|Zagreus|Don't look back, huh. I'll try not to. Though, you can't be blamed for doing it yourself, just the one time. What happened to you... it wasn't fair. If you ask me.
OrpheusGift05|Orpheus Gift 05|Orpheus|...I quite enjoyed our outing, Zagreus. So, I suppose I shall be seeing you around?
OrpheusGift06|Orpheus Gift 06|Orpheus|I am indebted to you, Zagreus, both for your friendship and embarrassment of generosity.
OrpheusGift06|Orpheus Gift 06|Zagreus|And I, in turn, am indebted to you, Orpheus, for your calm demeanor and ability to accept life's greatest challenges. You inspire me, and I wish you the best.
OrpheusGift07|Orpheus Gift 07|Zagreus|Hey, Orpheus, mate! I have something good for you right here... Ambrosia! All the way from the surface. I want you to have it.
OrpheusGift07|Orpheus Gift 07|Orpheus|Ah, but this is splendid, Zagreus. And I must say, apart from my Eurydice, I've never felt as strong a bond of kinship as with you.
OrpheusGift08|Orpheus Gift 08|Zagreus|Hey Orpheus, you know I once wrested this bottle of Ambrosia from the Champions of Elysium, defeating them two against one, just so I could bring it here to you personally?
OrpheusGift08|Orpheus Gift 08|Orpheus|Please, my friend! I feel I am undeserving of such a relentless show of kindness on your part. I shall accept, but you'll relent, won't you? As well as forgive me?
OrpheusGift08|Orpheus Gift 08|Zagreus|Mate, if that is your wish, then it will be my pleasure to oblige. Though, may this gift symbolize the strength of our friendship for an eternity to come. I've learned so much from you.
OrpheusGift08|Orpheus Gift 08|Orpheus|Thank you, my friend. Would that I had capacity to take some joy from this.
OrpheusWithEurydice01|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (1)|Orpheus|Why, Zagreus, how wonderful to see you here. Eurydice and I, we have been catching up for all the time we've spent apart.
OrpheusWithEurydice01|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (1)|Eurydice|Yeah. So, if you would excuse us for a little while, hon? I'm not finished catching up with him just yet. But first, before you go!
OrpheusWithEurydice02|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (2)|Zagreus|I've never heard anything like this. As good as you two sound each on your own, you're positively wonderful together.
OrpheusWithEurydice02|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (2)|Orpheus|A splendid compliment, my friend. Doubtless the Fates themselves conspired to ensure Eurydice and I would meet, and sing together. Fall in love. And then be cruelly separated for some time!
OrpheusWithEurydice02|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (2)|Eurydice|Now don't you start with that again, you get me, Orphy? Got our whole entire afterlives ahead of us! And lots of songs to catch up on.
OrpheusWithEurydice02|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (2)|Orpheus|Why, you're correct of course, my dear. If you'll excuse us, Zagreus? Our calling beckons.
OrpheusWithEurydice03|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (3)|Zagreus|Hey, you two, how's everything lately? On speaking terms again? Or singing terms?
OrpheusWithEurydice03|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (3)|Orpheus|Oh, things are going very wonderfully, my friend. I never thought I'd see Eurydice again, after I...
OrpheusWithEurydice03|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice (3)|Eurydice|Orphy still just can't shut up about that time, hon. But we're making progress. Thanks for having him stop by. I'm sure he needed plenty of encouragement.
OrpheusWithEurydiceEndTheme01|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice End Theme (1)|Zagreus|Hey, you're singing *In the Blood *after all, Orpheus! Thank you for taking my request!
OrpheusWithEurydiceEndTheme01|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice End Theme (1)|Orpheus|Oh, it is certainly my pleasure, Zagreus. This song of Eurydice's and mine, I've a connection to it, I suppose. Reminded me of some fond memories!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat01|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (1)|Eurydice|Hey, nice of you to visit us, Your Royal Majesty! For you!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat02|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (2)|Eurydice|Orphy and I, we're doing great here thanks to you. You take care, hon!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat03|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (3)|Eurydice|Hope you find yourself someone to sing with, too, hon.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat04|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (4)|Eurydice|Don't fret, Your Majesty, I'll have him back to work on time, you hear that, Orphy?
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat05|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (5)|Eurydice|Orphy and me, we're like your typical old married couple, hon.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat06|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (6)|Eurydice|If you find happiness out there, hon, don't look back.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat07|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (7)|Eurydice|Things aren't so bad here, hon. Hope you can say the same.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat08|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (8)|Eurydice|What can I say, hon? We like practicing our favorite tune!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat09|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (9)|Eurydice|Well if it isn't the Hades kid come to pay the both of us a visit!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat10|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (10)|Orpheus|...You must know, you sound as wonderful as ever, now, my dear!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat11|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (11)|Orpheus|Is she not truly wonderful, my friend?
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat12|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (12)|Orpheus|We sing, and sing, and never once grow weary, Zagreus!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat13|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (13)|Orpheus|I never thought I would see her again. You are to thank for this, my friend.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat14|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (14)|Orpheus|When we thus sing together, Zagreus, I lose all track of time.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat15|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (15)|Orpheus|Is the singing of Eurydice not the most splendid thing that you have ever heard?
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat16|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (16)|Orpheus|Shall there ever be a voice as lovely as Eurydice's, my friend?
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat17|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (17)|Orpheus|It gladdens me that you could join us here, my friend.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat18|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (18)|Eurydice|Guess what we've been up to lately, hon? Now if you'll excuse us?
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat19|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (19)|Eurydice|We just finished eating, here! Got plenty left over.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat20|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (20)|Eurydice|The one thing better than singing, hon, is singing with somebody you love.
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat21|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (21)|Eurydice|Orphy here's just practicing for when he's got to sing next for Hades Senior!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat22|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (22)|Eurydice|What do you know, we were just in the middle of a song here, hon!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat23|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (23)|Eurydice|Not much luck trying to teach Orphy to cook, but he can sing, all right!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat24|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (24)|Eurydice|Look, Orphy, we've got an audience! So sing your heart out!
OrpheusWithEurydiceMiscChat25|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice Misc Chat (25)|Eurydice|Don't mind Orphy, here, hon. Can't snap him out of it once he gets singing!
OrpheusWithEurydiceInTheBloodChat01|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice In The Blood Chat (1)|Eurydice|You know this tune, hon? It's one of our old hits!
OrpheusWithEurydiceInTheBloodChat02|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice In The Blood Chat (2)|Eurydice|We were just thinking about old times, Orphy and I!
OrpheusWithEurydiceInTheBloodChat03|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice In The Blood Chat (3)|Eurydice|Thought we'd mix up our singing just a bit here, hon!
OrpheusWithEurydiceInTheBloodChat04|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice In The Blood Chat (4)|Eurydice|Got to tell you I've warmed up to this old song over the years!
OrpheusWithEurydiceInTheBloodChat05|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice In The Blood Chat (5)|Orpheus|I know that you enjoy this one, my friend!
OrpheusWithEurydiceInTheBloodChat06|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice In The Blood Chat (6)|Orpheus|This one reminds me of my days alive with my Eurydice...!
OrpheusWithEurydiceInTheBloodChat07|Duo - Orpheus and Eurydice In The Blood Chat (7)|Orpheus|This song had quite a bit of popularity, one time.
MegaeraMeeting01|Megaera Meeting 01|Megaera|*Tsch*. The prodigal son returns.... Everyone's saying I went easy on you, Zag.
MegaeraMeeting01|Megaera Meeting 01|Zagreus|Don't worry, Meg. I eventually managed to get home the painful way after all.
MegaeraMeeting01|Megaera Meeting 01|Megaera|Look, I've a reputation to uphold. You get past me again like that, you best go all the way. Now, leave me be, and don't think you're going to be so lucky next we meet out there.
MegaeraMeeting01_B|Megaera Meeting 01 B|Megaera|*Tsch*. The prodigal son returns.... Everyone's saying I went easy on you, Zag.
MegaeraMeeting01_B|Megaera Meeting 01 B|Zagreus|Don't worry, Meg. I eventually managed to get home the painful way after all. Though... I managed to get much farther than you'd probably expect.
MegaeraMeeting01_B|Megaera Meeting 01 B|Megaera|I expected you to not get past me, yes. Look, I've a reputation to uphold. Don't think you're going to be so lucky next we meet out there.
MegaeraMeeting02|Megaera Meeting 02|Zagreus|Hey, *uh*, what's that you're drinking, Meg? Anything good?
MegaeraMeeting02|Megaera Meeting 02|Megaera|Whatever it is, it's weak. Enough to be mistaken for your blood.
MegaeraMeeting02|Megaera Meeting 02|Zagreus|Nice! Well, I'll just leave you to it, then.
MegaeraMeeting02Cont|Megaera Meeting 02 Cont|Megaera|I'll tear you limb from limb out there next time, you mark my words.
MegaeraMeeting03|Megaera Meeting 03|Zagreus|What are your sisters up to these days, Meg? I've not seen them around.
MegaeraMeeting03|Megaera Meeting 03|Megaera|We're stretched a little thin, as you can see. Some kind of war up there meant lots of business here. I'm left to hold the line. And deal with you.
MegaeraMeeting04|Megaera Meeting 04|Megaera|What do you want from me, leave me alone. We've nothing to discuss here anymore.
MegaeraMeeting04|Megaera Meeting 04|Zagreus|I was just checking up on you, just... let me know if you wanted to talk, for any reason.
MegaeraMeeting04|Megaera Meeting 04|Megaera|I am not interested in having company, especially from you. You stay the hell away while I'm off duty.
MegaeraMeeting04Cont|Megaera Meeting 04 Cont|Megaera|I told you to back off.
MegaeraMeeting05|Megaera Meeting 05|Megaera|Excuse me, is there something I can do for you, Prince Zagreus?
MegaeraMeeting05|Megaera Meeting 05|Zagreus|It's nothing, I just thought I'd say, that was well fought back there.
MegaeraMeeting05|Megaera Meeting 05|Megaera|There's no returning to the way things used to be, Zag. Now can I offer you some words of advice? Get over yourself. And get ready to die out there next time we meet.
MegaeraMirrorProgress01|Megaera Mirror Progress 01|Megaera|Zagreus. Good, I wanted to tell you something. Your victories against me? They don't count for anything.
MegaeraMirrorProgress01|Megaera Mirror Progress 01|Zagreus|Sounds like you've been giving this a lot of thought, there, Meg. How do you figure?
MegaeraMirrorProgress01|Megaera Mirror Progress 01|Megaera|Nyx's Mirror. You couldn't possibly beat me without its help, or hers.
MegaeraMirrorProgress01|Megaera Mirror Progress 01|Zagreus|I'm not competing with you, Meg. I'm trying to get past you, to the surface.
MegaeraMirrorProgress01|Megaera Mirror Progress 01|Megaera|Call it what you want. You're doing what you have to do. I understand. But you are not stronger than me. You just have more help.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02|Megaera Mirror Progress 02|Megaera|Beaten. By you. Without the help of Nyx's mirror. You humiliated me. And now you've come to rub it in, I guess? Well, go on, then. Not like you can shame me any more.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02|Megaera Mirror Progress 02|Zagreus|Meg, what is it going to take for you to quit treating me like I'm incompetent? Have I not grown even a little since we met? You were supposed to teach me something; what does that make you?
MegaeraMirrorProgress02|Megaera Mirror Progress 02|Megaera|*Tsch*... why don't you raise your voice a little louder so that all the House can hear. Is that what you want? For everyone to know that you're superior to me?
MegaeraMirrorProgress02|Megaera Mirror Progress 02|Zagreus|You're not hearing me, Meg. I know it sounds a little disingenuous considering we keep fighting to the death and all, but... I never meant to hurt you.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02|Megaera Mirror Progress 02|Megaera|You give yourself far too much credit, Zagreus. Leave me alone.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02B|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 B|Megaera|Beaten. By you. Without the help of Nyx's mirror. You humiliated me. And now you've come to rub it in, I guess? Well, go on, then. Not like you can shame me any more.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02B|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 B|Zagreus|Meg, that isn't why I'm here, you know that isn't how I am. Why can't you see it? All I've ever wanted was to prove myself to you.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02B|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 B|Megaera|*Tsch*... you think that you can prove yourself to me by winning in a fight?
MegaeraMirrorProgress02B|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 B|Zagreus|Sometimes I think that I can never really win with you, Meg. If I held back, what would you have thought?
MegaeraMirrorProgress02B|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 B|Megaera|If you think you know me so well, Zagreus, then you ought to know better than to keep this conversation going with me, now.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02C|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 C|Megaera|I can't believe it, Zag. I thought for sure that Nyx's mirror was the only reason you could beat me. I knew you'd changed to some extent, but... not this much.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02C|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 C|Zagreus|I had to see if I could do it, Meg. I've learned so much from you, I... thought maybe this was a way that I could prove myself to you. And to myself.
MegaeraMirrorProgress02C|Megaera Mirror Progress 02 C|Megaera|Prove yourself, to me...? You must not be as comfortable in your own skin as you let on. I can't decide if I like that about you. Now leave me alone while I give it some thought.
MegaeraPactProgress01|Megaera Pact Progress 01|Megaera|So, Zagreus. How's it going with that Pact of Punishment you signed? You've made some meaningful improvements to the Underworld.
MegaeraPactProgress01|Megaera Pact Progress 01|Zagreus|I'll fight my way out of this place, or earn it. The Pact is nothing to me other than a way to keep things lively.
MegaeraPactProgress01|Megaera Pact Progress 01|Megaera|You are delusional. I'll never understand you or your father. Anyway, if you're looking for more punishment, you know where to find me.
MegaeraAboutPact01|Megaera About Pact 01|Megaera|Zagreus. I heard Lord Hades served you with a Pact of Punishment. You must be very proud.
MegaeraAboutPact01|Megaera About Pact 01|Zagreus|What, you mean the gigantic infernal contract reserved only for extraordinary circumstances? Yeah, I suppose I'm pleased that Father's gone to all that trouble just for me.
MegaeraAboutPact01|Megaera About Pact 01|Megaera|Well, when you're finished being smug about it? Know that all of us are bound by its terms. You can force a lot of things to change if you're not careful.
MegaeraAboutPact01|Megaera About Pact 01|Zagreus|A lot of things, such as how you refuse to reason with your positively charming sisters, Meg?
MegaeraAboutPact01|Megaera About Pact 01|Megaera|The Extreme Measures condition... you wouldn't dare. Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
MegaeraRunProgress01|Megaera Run Progress 01|Megaera|Well, how was it up there, Zagreus? Within Elysium. You'll have to tell us all about it every time the greatest strike you down.
MegaeraRunProgress01|Megaera Run Progress 01|Zagreus|You've never been there, have you? It's... lush? Is that a word? It feels closer to the surface. Closer to the sky.
MegaeraRunProgress01|Megaera Run Progress 01|Megaera|How poetic. You could have visited as part of your responsibilities. Instead, you trespass. Incurring wrath of fallen champions in service of your father.
MegaeraRunProgress02|Megaera Run Progress 02|Megaera|So you cleared out some of the Satyr infestation near the surface, then. How come the change of heart? Not like you to assist Lord Hades in such things.
MegaeraRunProgress02|Megaera Run Progress 02|Zagreus|I wasn't trying to do my father any favors, Meg. Those Satyrs seem to hate me just as much as him. My one way out involves a detour straight into their dens.
MegaeraRunProgress02|Megaera Run Progress 02|Megaera|An interesting coincidence. At any rate, that's one less problem for the rest of us to deal with. Until the Satyrs all come back, at least, which won't be long.
MegaeraRunProgress03|Megaera Run Progress 03|Megaera|You've been through hell more times than you can count by now, haven't you, Zag. You getting used to it? No wonder that you're friends with Sisyphus.
MegaeraRunProgress03|Megaera Run Progress 03|Zagreus|I'm getting used to it, all right. I'll keep going, for as many chances as it takes. I'll look forward to our next appointment out there.
MegaeraRunProgress03|Megaera Run Progress 03|Megaera|*Appointment*. Indeed. Don't keep me waiting. For all your toil, I'm sure you're not even close.
MegaeraRunCleared01|Megaera Run Cleared 01|Megaera|Zagreus, please tell me that the rumors are untrue. You really vanquished him? Have you completely lost your mind? You're going to destroy this blasted House!
MegaeraRunCleared01|Megaera Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|Come on, Meg, Father had it coming for some time. What's your concern, besides? The House is safe.
MegaeraRunCleared01|Megaera Run Cleared 01|Megaera|He's not going to take this lying down. He'll find some way to take it out on you. On all of us. You watch yourself, or all of us will pay.
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 01|Megaera|What are you doing here? I heard you finally made it out. What, did you break out of here, only to die in some pathetic way on the surface?
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 01|Zagreus|Long story, but yeah. Boils down to what you said, more or less.
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 01|Megaera|So you're going back out there, again. Well, it's your business, not mine. For your sake... I hope it's worth it.
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Meg, did you... did you ever meet the Queen...? Remember anything about her, at all?
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 02|Megaera|It was not my place to address her. I barely ever saw her. Then, at some point... I never saw her again. And, unlike you, I know better than to get involved in things that are none of my business.
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting02|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|How is it that this place has this secret Queen for I don't know how long, then suddenly she just vanishes, and no one speaks a word of it?
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 03|Megaera|How is she doing, Zagreus? The Queen, I mean. She was... I had admired her.
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|Mother... she's doing well, I think. She's in good spirits every time we meet. Happy to let her know you're thinking of her, by the way!
MegaeraAboutPersephoneMeeting03|Megaera About Persephone Meeting 03|Megaera|Don't, it's... it isn't necessary. She doesn't need you telling her about this place. Sounds to me like she is better off without.
MegaeraPostEnding01|Megaera Post Ending 01|Megaera|Just so I understand. Breaking through everything in your path, taking resources from your father's realm, trying to get through me... all officially part of the job description?
MegaeraPostEnding01|Megaera Post Ending 01|Zagreus|I guess that's right... but, before you ask, I'm not doing it for him.
MegaeraPostEnding01|Megaera Post Ending 01|Megaera|I didn't think you'd have it in you. To leave this place for good. But I didn't think you'd take responsibility for anything, either. Anyway... we'll just have to kill each other more officially, I guess.
MegaeraPostEnding03|Megaera Post Ending 03|Megaera|I never thought I'd see the Queen again. I still can't quite believe she's back... and staying? Is that really your doing?
MegaeraPostEnding03|Megaera Post Ending 03|Zagreus|It's her doing, not mine. So you know her? Because... you could have told me. About her. Who she was to me.
MegaeraPostEnding03|Megaera Post Ending 03|Megaera|Don't know her all that well. But I do know Nyx, and I've been bound to secrecy as part of my oath to this House. I flay oathbreakers and liars, Zagreus. Wouldn't do for me to be no better than them, now, would it?
MegaeraPostEnding03|Megaera Post Ending 03|Zagreus|No, I suppose not. So what does this mean for Nyx, now that she's back? Or for you, for that matter?
MegaeraPostEnding03|Megaera Post Ending 03|Megaera|The Queen always gave Nyx her space. Your father, though... I don't know what it'll be like for him, if she decides to stick around this time.
MegaeraPostEpilogue01|Megaera Post Epilogue 01|Megaera|So the Olympians are backing you officially now? Doing their part to help the family business, finally. Lord Hades probably never thought he'd see the day. Night? You know what I mean.
MegaeraPostEpilogue01|Megaera Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Seems only fair they should help in some capacity. They all work together on the surface, and, let's face it, they're responsible for a good number of shades pouring into this realm. Least they can do is help shore up the whole *'there is no escape' *reputation we've got.
MegaeraPostEpilogue01|Megaera Post Epilogue 01|Megaera|By making you unfairly stronger by the time you try to get through me?
MegaeraAboutRelationship01|Megaera About Relationship 01|Megaera|Well, Zag? You like things nice and complicated, don't you. Apparently so do I.
MegaeraAboutRelationship01|Megaera About Relationship 01|Zagreus|If you're asking if I have any regrets about what happened between us, the answer is no. Being with you... any complications there are worth it.
MegaeraAboutRelationship01|Megaera About Relationship 01|Megaera|You don't need to tell me. Two rules, if you want to keep this up. First... we set the personal aside when we're out there. I better not hear a soul say I'm going soft on you. And second... keep up this slightly more mature thing you've had going for you recently.
MegaeraAboutRelationship01|Megaera About Relationship 01|Zagreus|Wasn't planning on sliding back into the insensitive nonsense of youth, so I don't think the second thing will be a problem. But the first... can we really just keep killing each other out there like nothing happened?
MegaeraAboutRelationship01B|Megaera About Relationship 01 B|Megaera|*Tsk*... Come off it, Zag. Are you really going to act all uncomfortable every time you see me now? More than usual I mean.
MegaeraAboutRelationship01B|Megaera About Relationship 01 B|Zagreus|No, it's just... I felt terrible, turning you away. It's just... I've been so confused lately, and... I trust you. You're someone I can talk to. I guess I'm... afraid to lose that.
MegaeraAboutRelationship01B|Megaera About Relationship 01 B|Megaera|Don't be an idiot, and you won't. We've been through a lot together. Grown, maybe. This particular relationship... it can't die so easily, I think.
MegaeraAboutRelationship02|Megaera About Relationship 02|Zagreus|I feel like everybody knows about us, Meg. Even Aphrodite, herself, seemed to know we were involved. It's not like I've been going around boasting. You wanted to keep things quiet, didn't you?
MegaeraAboutRelationship02|Megaera About Relationship 02|Megaera|Zagreus. Are you happy with how things are between us now? Or do you have a problem with it?
MegaeraAboutRelationship02|Megaera About Relationship 02|Zagreus|Well, I could do without the kill-or-be-killed stuff if we're being honest, that part is still a little weird, but otherwise... yes, I mean... I'm happy. You're *you*.
MegaeraAboutRelationship02|Megaera About Relationship 02|Megaera|Then, that's enough. Let them say what they want. What does it matter? We're gods. The things they say about us... even other gods... you pay too much attention to it, it'll drive you out of your mind.
MegaeraAboutRelationship02|Megaera About Relationship 02|Zagreus|But... I know how important your career is to you. This won't create a problem?
MegaeraAboutRelationship02|Megaera About Relationship 02|Megaera|We've already crossed that bridge, I think. Stop worrying.
MegaeraAboutRelationship03|Megaera About Relationship 03|Zagreus|Megaera... you ever been in love with somebody?
MegaeraAboutRelationship03|Megaera About Relationship 03|Megaera|...*Hm*. Yes.
MegaeraAboutRelationship03|Megaera About Relationship 03|Zagreus|Who?
MegaeraAboutRelationship03|Megaera About Relationship 03|Megaera|...Shut up.
MegaeraAboutZagreusPromotion01|Megaera About Zagreus Promotion 01|Megaera|Never in my wildest fantasies did I imagine you'd ever end up on the Featured Houseservant Board, Zagreus. I still can't entirely believe it.
MegaeraAboutZagreusPromotion01|Megaera About Zagreus Promotion 01|Zagreus|*Whoa*, back up! Can you elaborate a bit about these wildest fantasies, Meg?
MegaeraAboutZagreusPromotion01|Megaera About Zagreus Promotion 01|Megaera|I'm serious. You should be proud. Not arrogantly proud to a fatal fault or anything, but a little bit is all right in a case like this.
MegaeraAboutRepeatedLosses01|Megaera About Repeated Losses 01|Megaera|Got to tell you something, Zagreus. I'm not getting any more used to losing to you like this. I mean... you don't even stop to rub it in. You know how humiliating that is?
MegaeraAboutRepeatedLosses01|Megaera About Repeated Losses 01|Zagreus|Wait, you're saying you would feel *less *ashamed about the outcomes of our fights if I were to gloat *more *about beating you? How does that make any sense?
MegaeraAboutRepeatedLosses01|Megaera About Repeated Losses 01|Megaera|You know what doesn't make any sense? That you keep beating me. I must be getting sloppy if I'm that predictable... too bad none of the other wretches I have to deal with put up much of a fight.
MegaeraAboutSisters01|Megaera About Sisters 01|Zagreus|You and your sisters really don't get along well, do you.
MegaeraAboutSisters01|Megaera About Sisters 01|Megaera|Alecto and Tisiphone and I each have a different outlook, I would say. We've learned mostly to stay out of one another's way.
MegaeraAboutSisters01|Megaera About Sisters 01|Zagreus|That doesn't sound like a healthy basis for a relationship between siblings.
MegaeraAboutSisters01|Megaera About Sisters 01|Megaera|Are you lecturing me about healthy relationships with family, Zagreus? Your family, your father's family, is the most broken and corrupted in the history of the entire concept.
MegaeraAboutSisters01|Megaera About Sisters 01|Zagreus|...Fair point. I... didn't mean to sound like I had any meaningful advice, there, Meg. We're stuck with our bloodlines and our relatives, aren't we.
MegaeraAboutSisters01|Megaera About Sisters 01|Megaera|Your family cut their Titan parents into pieces and then scattered them in Tartarus. Remember that when next you tell me about family.
MegaeraAboutSisters02|Megaera About Sisters 02|Zagreus|You know, while it was brutal squaring off against the three of you, I have to say, Meg... I was happy you were with your sisters. Nothing like a common cause for bringing bitter rivals together, right?
MegaeraAboutSisters02|Megaera About Sisters 02|Megaera|You have your Pact of Punishment to thank for our reunion, there. We have to answer to its terms. But my sisters and I, we got on better than I had expected, I will give you that.
MegaeraAboutSisters02|Megaera About Sisters 02|Zagreus|So you've patched things up, then? Going to start spending more quality time together and all that?
MegaeraAboutSisters02|Megaera About Sisters 02|Megaera|*Hm*, let's not get carried away. A work assignment forcing our cooperation is not exactly a big step in the quality of our relationship.
MegaeraAboutAlecto01|Megaera About Alecto 01|Zagreus|Alecto's really something else. She must have been a real handful, huh?
MegaeraAboutAlecto01|Megaera About Alecto 01|Megaera|My youngest sister takes a lot of pleasure from her work. I've learned something of that from her. But that's as far as we relate, I think.
MegaeraAboutAlecto01|Megaera About Alecto 01|Zagreus|She could learn a thing or two from you, I'm sure. About having a little common decency, perhaps.
MegaeraAboutAlecto01|Megaera About Alecto 01|Megaera|She won't be learning anything from me. The contempt you get from her is unconditional. I learned not to take it personally.
MegaeraAboutTisiphone01|Megaera About Tisiphone 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, so, about Tisiphone, is... *uh*... everything all right with her? Talk of murder, all the time, and all.
MegaeraAboutTisiphone01|Megaera About Tisiphone 01|Megaera|Tisiphone is charged with punishing the worst that mortals have to offer. More than charged. Her work is everything to her.
MegaeraAboutTisiphone01|Megaera About Tisiphone 01|Zagreus|No time for family or recreation, then, I take it? Pity what happens to those overly obsessed with work.
MegaeraAboutTisiphone01|Megaera About Tisiphone 01|Megaera|I get what you're insinuating, Zagreus. I'm nothing like her. Not even close. And don't you dare compare the two of us again.
MegaeraAboutTisiphone02|Megaera About Tisiphone 02|Megaera|So you've been trying to give Tisiphone speech lessons between fights to the death. Are you bored, or just naive?
MegaeraAboutTisiphone02|Megaera About Tisiphone 02|Zagreus|Come on, if her vocabulary consists of two different although admittedly almost identical words, there's got to be room for growth, there. Besides, I feel like... maybe she's lonely, or something. Has anyone ever tried to teach her anything?
MegaeraAboutTisiphone02|Megaera About Tisiphone 02|Megaera|Maybe, just maybe, you're projecting your own insecurities onto her a little bit? Tis can take care of herself. Always has. Talking's not her strong suit like it's yours. But if you, in all your wisdom, think you've got something to teach her, you go right ahead.
MegaeraAboutTisiphone02|Megaera About Tisiphone 02|Zagreus|You've tried already, haven't you? She's pretty dead-set on the murder thing, then?
MegaeraAboutThanatos01|Megaera About Thanatos 01|Zagreus|You and Thanatos don't work together much anymore, do you, Meg?
MegaeraAboutThanatos01|Megaera About Thanatos 01|Megaera|No. Though he still brings me my assignments every now and then.
MegaeraAboutThanatos01|Megaera About Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Oathbreakers, traitors, and the like? Sending them straight to Tartarus, huh. Must be quite an experience going from living and breathing, to... being dead, to being whisked off by Thanatos, straight to you and your whip.
MegaeraAboutThanatos01|Megaera About Thanatos 01|Megaera|If that's not the experience mortals are looking for, they need only keep their oaths and not betray the ones they're closest to. It's not that hard.
MegaeraAboutHypnos01|Megaera About Hypnos 01|Zagreus|You're not too broken up about how things ended between you and Hypnos, are you, Meg?
MegaeraAboutHypnos01|Megaera About Hypnos 01|Megaera|I'm still in a state of shock. I'll have to pick up the pieces somehow, and figure out how to get on with my existence.
MegaeraAboutOrpheus01|Megaera About Orpheus 01|Megaera|You got that court musician to pipe up again. I know *you *can't shut up, but didn't know it was contagious.
MegaeraAboutOrpheus01|Megaera About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|Hey, it was all Orpheus, not me. Can't sing like that without a lot of motivation, inner turmoil, who knows what else. Why, don't you like it? This lounge seems better with a little song.
MegaeraAboutOrpheus01|Megaera About Orpheus 01|Megaera|This lounge is fine. And the singing... not used to it yet.
MegaeraAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Megaera About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Megaera|Not seen the court musician sulking over there quite as much lately. Your doing, I hear?
MegaeraAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Megaera About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|You'll just have to sulk for the both of you, I guess, then, Meg. But if you must know, on my authority I have released Orpheus from the terms of his old, rather unfair agreement with Father, so he can see his wife at least from time to time.
MegaeraAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Megaera About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Megaera|And Lord Hades is OK with you just picking out old binding contracts and nullifying them? You're exploiting your status.
MegaeraAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Megaera About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|I'm doing no such thing. Father wanted me involved in all this business with his pacts, and presiding over the dead, then fine. But I'll do it my way.
MegaeraGhostAdminProgress01|Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 01|Zagreus|What do you think of all the lounge decor, there, Meg? Looking a little better these days, wouldn't you say?
MegaeraGhostAdminProgress01|Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 01|Megaera|You know, it isn't bad. Though I have heard the strangest thing, that you're responsible, for all of this? I couldn't understand why you would even bother, honestly.
MegaeraGhostAdminProgress01|Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 01|Zagreus|Well, it's a popular locale for off-duty Underworld officers to take a load off between shifts, and so I figure... least I can do is pitch in and make the place a little better than I left it, right?
MegaeraGhostAdminProgress01|Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 01|Megaera|How very selfless of you, Zagreus. Soon doubtless it'll be your portrait hanging on that wall back there.
MegaeraGhostAdminProgress02|Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 02|Megaera|The prism-sphere in the corner is maybe a little much. But the fireplace... the bat-cage... the aquarium... this lounge is practically comfortable. Lord Hades would strongly disapprove.
MegaeraGhostAdminProgress02|Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 02|Zagreus|Good thing he never sets foot in here, then, huh? Wait, you don't miss when things were all sad and dreary in here, do you?
MegaeraGhostAdminProgress02|Megaera Ghost Admin Progress 02|Megaera|I'm still getting used to it. But, no.
MegaeraAboutLegendary01|Megaera About Legendary 01|Megaera|How's my little Battie doing, Zag? The one I gave you. Was just a little pup. I figured she'd be better off with you. Please tell me I was right.
MegaeraAboutLegendary01|Megaera About Legendary 01|Zagreus|Battie's doing great, Meg. Reminds me of you every time I think of her. Helps keep me company throughout my little jaunts outside. So you've a thing for bats, then?
MegaeraAboutLegendary01|Megaera About Legendary 01|Megaera|That's good. And yes, the bats around here, they and I have always shared an understanding, you could say. I usually care for the pups myself. But Battie? She seemed more your style.
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx01|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Zagreus|Meg, what's going on with Nyx and Dusa, do you know? I think they've been butting heads a bit lately.
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx01|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Megaera|I can't imagine why. Nyx has her under strict orders, yet you keep on stopping by for your little chats. You think she doesn't notice?
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx01|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Zagreus|What does she care? I talk to everybody around here at least a bit.
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx01|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 01|Megaera|It's not my business, Zag. Not even for Dusa. But you watch yourself.
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx02|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 02|Megaera|Damn you, Zagreus. She was my friend. And now she's gone.
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx02|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 02|Zagreus|Who, you mean Dusa? Like I had anything to do with that. It's Nyx you should be cross with, not me!
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx02|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 02|Megaera|I don't think so. Nyx warned you. *Ungh*, you know I can't go to her myself about this, so *fix it*!
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx03|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 03|Zagreus|You saw Dusa's back, right, Meg? She's getting another chance. Nyx reconsidered!
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx03|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 03|Megaera|I saw. Nyx doesn't often change her mind when it comes to this House. But I won't second guess what happened or why.
MegaeraAboutDusaVsNyx03|Megaera About Dusa Vs Nyx 03|Zagreus|You don't sound all that pleased...
MegaeraAboutDusaPromotion01|Megaera About Dusa Promotion 01|Zagreus|I'm so proud of Dusa lately, Meg! Chief Custodian of the House, was it? That's quite an honor coming from Nyx.
MegaeraAboutDusaPromotion01|Megaera About Dusa Promotion 01|Megaera|I thought all the added responsibility would stress Dusa out worse than usual. But she's taking it in stride.
MegaeraAboutDusaPromotion01|Megaera About Dusa Promotion 01|Zagreus|You're always looking out for her. Thanks for that.
MegaeraAboutDusaPromotion01|Megaera About Dusa Promotion 01|Megaera|Not doing it for you. Though... thanks for looking out for her, yourself.
MegaeraAboutDusaLegendary01|Megaera About Dusa Legendary 01|Megaera|I did not appreciate you sending Dusa after me out there, Zag. You leave her out of this! Though... it was good to see her out of this damned House for a change.
MegaeraAboutDusaLegendary01|Megaera About Dusa Legendary 01|Zagreus|See, I, too, thought she could use the fresh air. Or... however you'd describe the quality of the air on the edge of Tartarus. You know she'd never mean you any harm, right? In her mind... I think she's trying to keep it friendly between us.
MegaeraAboutDusaLegendary01|Megaera About Dusa Legendary 01|Megaera|Eugh, she said the same thing to me. Look, you know what, fine. If that's the only way to get her to take a break from this place, I guess it's for the best.
MegaeraAboutSisyphus01|Megaera About Sisyphus 01|Zagreus|Hey, Meg, I understand you're under orders to kill me on sight out there, but... do you really have to go so hard on Sisyphus?
MegaeraAboutSisyphus01|Megaera About Sisyphus 01|Megaera|That wretched shade isn't who you think he is. Do you have any idea of the magnitude of his crimes from when he led a mortal life?
MegaeraAboutSisyphus01|Megaera About Sisyphus 01|Zagreus|He cheated death. Tricked Thanatos and maybe Father, too.
MegaeraAboutSisyphus01|Megaera About Sisyphus 01|Megaera|Before that, he did worse. He was an awful man. I think that is the real reason that your father punished him.
MegaeraAboutSisyphus01|Megaera About Sisyphus 01|Zagreus|What if he's changed? Or... is that impossible. No coming back from certain crimes.
MegaeraAboutSisyphus01|Megaera About Sisyphus 01|Megaera|No coming back from certain crimes, indeed. Though you may have more mercy in your heart to spare than I in mine.
MegaeraAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Megaera About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Zagreus|I have to ask you for a favor, Meg. And I'm willing to make it worth your while, if you'll hear me out.
MegaeraAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Megaera About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Megaera|A proposition, Zagreus? Let's hear it, then. While I'm in a charitable mood.
MegaeraAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Megaera About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Zagreus|It's about Sisyphus. If I can get my father to alleviate his sentence, would you just... ease off of him, a little bit? You and your sisters. I think he's suffered quite enough under your whips.
MegaeraAboutSisyphusLiberationQuest01|Megaera About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01|Megaera|I don't know what you see in him, I swear. But you don't need to ask such things of me. If you can overturn his sentence with Lord Hades, I'd like nothing better than to never see that miserable shade again.
MegaeraBuildingTrust01|Megaera Building Trust 01|Zagreus|Megaera, I have to ask you something, please. We really need to talk.
MegaeraBuildingTrust01|Megaera Building Trust 01|Megaera|...For once, I think you're right. Although, I'm curious, what is it that you think we have to talk about?
MegaeraBuildingTrust01|Megaera Building Trust 01|Zagreus|I still have feelings for you. At least... I think I do. Isn't there... isn't there someway for us to, you know... work through all of this?
MegaeraBuildingTrust01|Megaera Building Trust 01|Megaera|In spite of everything that's happened, and that's happening right now? What are the outcomes, Zagreus? Either you eventually succeed, and leave this place, or else, what, exactly?
MegaeraBuildingTrust01|Megaera Building Trust 01|Zagreus|...I haven't thought that far ahead. But I don't think it has to be this way. I don't hate you, Meg. I don't think I can ever hate you.
MegaeraBuildingTrust01|Megaera Building Trust 01|Megaera|...Despite my best intentions. Unfortunately, I don't know that I can say the same. Look, I'm at a very difficult point in my career. I need to focus on that now. Do we understand each other?
MegaeraBuildingTrust01_B|Megaera Building Trust 01 B|Zagreus|Megaera, I have to ask you something, please. We really need to talk.
MegaeraBuildingTrust01_B|Megaera Building Trust 01 B|Megaera|...For once, I think you're right. Although, I'm curious, what is it that you think we have to talk about?
MegaeraBuildingTrust01_B|Megaera Building Trust 01 B|Zagreus|I still have feelings for you. At least... I think I do. Isn't there... isn't there someway for us to, you know... work through all of this?
MegaeraBuildingTrust01_B|Megaera Building Trust 01 B|Megaera|In spite of everything that's happened, and that's happening right now? What are the outcomes, Zagreus? What, exactly?
MegaeraBuildingTrust01_B|Megaera Building Trust 01 B|Zagreus|...I haven't thought that far ahead. But I don't think it has to be this way. I don't hate you, Meg. I don't think I can ever hate you.
MegaeraBuildingTrust01_B|Megaera Building Trust 01 B|Megaera|...Despite my best intentions. Unfortunately, I don't know that I can say the same. Look, I'm at a very difficult point in my career. I need to focus on that now. Do we understand each other?
MegaeraAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Megaera About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Meg, you know what's going on with Than and me, don't you? I just... want things to be out in the open, between us.
MegaeraAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Megaera About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Megaera|Oh I know everything about you, Zag. And Thanatos, maybe even better. Though I appreciate you telling me. It's fine.
MegaeraAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Megaera About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Zagreus|It's fine? I mean... upon Olympus, jealousy runs rampant, as I'm told. But here it's not even an issue, then?
MegaeraAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Megaera About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Megaera|If you prefer the way they do things on Olympus, then I think you know the way. As for me... dealing with jealousy is what I do. Tell me, should I feel threatened by Thanatos?
MegaeraAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Megaera About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Zagreus|No... he thinks so highly of you, he... he'd never wish to cause you any harm.
MegaeraAboutBeingCloseWithThanatos01|Megaera About Being Close With Thanatos 01|Megaera|And I feel much the same. He and I, we're not the same to you. I think we both see that, and understand. Now quit your second-guessing me, all right?
MegaeraWithHades01|Duo - Megaera and Hades (1)|Hades|...Make certain of it, Megaera. I am finding, lately, that the help within this House is much more lacking than it used to be. I trust that you shall set it back on course.
MegaeraWithHades01|Duo - Megaera and Hades (1)|Megaera|...If that is your will, Lord Hades, then it will be done. To the fullest limits of my capability.
MegaeraWithHades02|Duo - Megaera and Hades (2)|Megaera|...Give me another chance, Lord Hades. I can do better. Don't... bring them here.
MegaeraWithHades02|Duo - Megaera and Hades (2)|Hades|It is already too late for that, Megaera. They have been notified and are en route to Tartarus even as we speak.
MegaeraWithHades02|Duo - Megaera and Hades (2)|Megaera|You know what they're like. They are best left to their specific tasks. Not this.
MegaeraWithHades02|Duo - Megaera and Hades (2)|Hades|Megaera, trust me when I say I know the feeling all too well. However, surely, in your ingenuity, you may yet find a way to get your sisters to see eye to eye.
MegaeraWithHades03|Duo - Megaera and Hades (3)|Megaera|...I cannot work with them, Lord Hades. Please. They don't respect my words, or even listen.
MegaeraWithHades03|Duo - Megaera and Hades (3)|Hades|*Enough*! Besides, Megaera, this is not your failing. It is mine. I must attend to these affairs more actively.
MegaeraWithHades03|Duo - Megaera and Hades (3)|Megaera|...I've often tried, but never to a satisfactory result. You're asking the impossible of me.
MegaeraWithHades03|Duo - Megaera and Hades (3)|Hades|I am not asking, Megaera.
MegaeraWithHades04|Duo - Megaera and Hades (4)|Megaera|...But, I don't understand, Lord Hades. I have fallen to him countless times. How can this be...?
MegaeraWithHades04|Duo - Megaera and Hades (4)|Hades|You and your sisters have protected Tartarus unerringly. The Prince has proven uncontainable. The fault is mine, not yours. Your duty to this realm must be commended.
MegaeraWithHades04|Duo - Megaera and Hades (4)|Megaera|You honor me... I have done nothing to deserve this. There must be something more that I can do?
MegaeraWithHades04|Duo - Megaera and Hades (4)|Hades|There is, and isn't, Megaera. I ask only that you remain committed to this realm. Bar passage in and out of Tartarus. And, if the Prince continues to show up... you give him hell.
MegaeraWithHades04|Duo - Megaera and Hades (4)|Megaera|Lord Hades, it will be my pleasure, sir.
MegaeraWithNyx01|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (1)|Nyx|...We each have our commitments to this House, Megaera. There is no shame in yours. And whilst your sisters are away, you bear their burden of responsibility, as well.
MegaeraWithNyx01|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (1)|Megaera|I understand, it's just... am I supposed to keep pretending nothing's changed? This House is cracking at the seams, and no one's going to admit it?
MegaeraWithNyx01|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (1)|Nyx|The House shall stand eternally, although in what condition, it is ours to decide. Our obligation is to keep the House in order.
MegaeraWithNyx01|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (1)|Megaera|I know. You're right of course, you're right... I'll do my best. I'll do my best for both our sakes, Nyx.
MegaeraWithNyx02|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (2)|Nyx|...and so, who else is there to be depended on...? You are a trusted overseer, Megaera. Your station is no accident and there is no one better fit for what you do. I urge you to look inwardly. How you approach your work is vital to the end result.
MegaeraWithNyx02|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (2)|Megaera|...Thank you for the advice, Nyx. I don't know what I'd do without you. Or what this House would be if not for you.
MegaeraWithNyx03|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (3)|Megaera|...But, how can you do this to me? Blast your Mirror. By taking sides with him, you're standing against me...!
MegaeraWithNyx03|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (3)|Nyx|Neutrality ceases to be an option when a crisis rises to a certain point, Megaera. You, yourself, shall have to choose allegiances. I have steadfastly told you this throughout our shared ordeal.
MegaeraWithNyx03|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (3)|Megaera|I thought that both of our allegiances were to this House, Nyx. It seems I was mistaken. Do you have any idea what sort of pressure I am under here...?
MegaeraWithNyx03|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (3)|Nyx|Use caution with the tone you take with me, Overseer. I am the mother of the Fates, themselves. I do not act by whim or by mistake. Mind your own station, and perform your role. All shall unfold eventually as it must. I like the intervening time no more than you.
MegaeraWithNyx04|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (4)|Megaera|...Nyx, you'd tell me if I made a terrible mistake, or even just a bad one, wouldn't you? I need your guidance on this one, or maybe your approval.
MegaeraWithNyx04|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (4)|Nyx|You shall always be the best determiner of what is right about such matters, Megaera. Though, if you seek my blessings or encouragement in this particular pursuit, please rest assured... you have them both. You know the way, from here.
MegaeraWithNyx04|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (4)|Megaera|I hope that you are right. You always have been, it's just that... I wish I had your confidence in this.
MegaeraWithNyx05|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (5)|Megaera|...I think I understand, now, Nyx. You've been here longer than the rest of us combined. You've seen this House go through a lot. Even before Lord Hades took his place. I never should have doubted you.
MegaeraWithNyx05|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (5)|Nyx|To doubt is an important instinct, Megaera. Without it, we could not conceive of better circumstances than the ones we know. Besides... I am the Night. Others shall always doubt me. You may doubt me again. I ask only that you heed well your intuitions, from now on.
MegaeraWithNyx05|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (5)|Megaera|I will. I promise, Nyx. And if there's anything you ever need that I can do, well... please, just ask of me.
MegaeraWithNyx06|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (6)|Megaera|...They can't be reasoned with, Nyx. You know that. What use are they to us, trying to manage this? They'll make things worse.
MegaeraWithNyx06|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (6)|Nyx|They are your sisters. They are part of your life, whether you like it or not. Your relationship with them is yours to mold.
MegaeraWithNyx06|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (6)|Megaera|I'm afraid there isn't much for me to work with. You have a lot more faith in them than I do.
MegaeraWithNyx06|Duo - Megaera and Nyx (6)|Nyx|I have a lot more faith in *you*, Megaera. There are many obstinate personalities with whom we regularly interact. Thus, we do what is possible.
MegaeraWithHypnos01|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (1)|Megaera|...Would you look at that, Hypnos. Care to repeat to me the unsolicited advice you just now offered, now that Zagreus is here?
MegaeraWithHypnos01|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (1)|Hypnos|Oh, *hahaha*, well, it is my custom to give pointers to our visitors, who come involuntarily, because, I do pick up a lot of bits and pieces, talking here to everyone! About, you know... dying?
MegaeraWithHypnos01|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (1)|Megaera|Zagreus. He told me that I ought to evade more of your attacks next time. So you just watch your back out there, because I know your secrets thanks to Hypnos here.
MegaeraWithHypnos02|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (2)|Megaera|...I think that I can find the lounge well on my own, Hypnos. Or... wait... what is this, did you just ask me out?
MegaeraWithHypnos02|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (2)|Hypnos|Me? No, *nonononono*, no! I'd never even think to do that, Miss, I mean, you have your station, and I have mine. We're from two different worlds, you could say. Fated never to be seen together much.
MegaeraWithHypnos02|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (2)|Megaera|Every time I talk to you, you somehow take it as a compliment, is that correct? Then, let me give *you *some advice, for once. Stop being an idiot.
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (3)|Megaera|...You haven't greeted me as often lately, Hypnos. I wouldn't have noticed if it weren't half your job. If there's something you wish to say to me, why not just come right out.
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (3)|Hypnos|Oh, um, well, I, see, the thing is, Megaera, Miss Megaera, mind if I call you that? As I was saying, I just, thought maybe, you know, we had a thing, a real connection, lately, since you keep on dying more and more, and I keep standing here? But then... I always thought you were invincible...
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (3)|Megaera|I see. And so you're realizing now that your entire image of me came from your imagination, is that it?
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (3)|Hypnos|Well, it's just! I really thought with all my advice that you'd go back to killing Zagreus, rather than the other way around! I just don't think things are working out the way I hoped, you know?
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (3)|Megaera|It almost sounds as though you've broken up with me, except... well, are you sure that you'll be all right?
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (3)|Hypnos|Oh, yeah! Look, I'm just glad it's one of you two, sure beats having to greet shades nonstop! They never talk to me.
MegaeraWithHypnos03|Duo - Megaera and Hypnos (3)|Megaera|All right, then... you greet me next I'm here.
MegaeraWithPersephone01|Duo - Megaera and Persephone (1)|Megaera|...It was my duty to prevent him from getting farther. If I succeeded... he never would have found you. So this once, I'm glad I failed. I hope you know that, my Queen.
MegaeraWithPersephone01|Duo - Megaera and Persephone (1)|Persephone|I hoped, but did not know for certain till I heard from you just now, Overseer Megaera! And, if I may? I understand you have achieved an awful lot since I took my, *erm*, leave of absence from this House. I see why Nyx and Hades put their trust in you!
MegaeraWithPersephone01|Duo - Megaera and Persephone (1)|Megaera|Thank you, my Queen. Then, if there's anything else that I can do to help you reacclimate yourself, I'm always at your service. You are most welcome, here.
MegaeraWithPersephone01|Duo - Megaera and Persephone (1)|Persephone|Likewise, you be sure to let me know if my son there happens to make more trouble for you than you welcome in your life. All right?
MegChat01|Meg Chat 01|Megaera|Can't you see I'm busy now with more important things than you?
MegChat02|Meg Chat 02|Megaera|May I help you somehow, Zagreus? Because if not, why don't you leave me be.
MegChat03|Meg Chat 03|Megaera|Do I look like I'm in the mood to chat?
MegChat04|Meg Chat 04|Megaera|You've come to gloat, I guess? Too bad I can't just kill you where you stand, within this blasted House.
MegChat05|Meg Chat 05|Megaera|Have I somehow created the impression that I wish to speak with you? Because if so, there's been a terrible mistake.
MegChat06|Meg Chat 06|Megaera|There must be someone else whose time you could be wasting, Zagreus.
MegChat07|Meg Chat 07|Megaera|It's embarrassing enough having returned here, much less to be seen talking to you.
MegChat08|Meg Chat 08|Megaera|Sooner or later when we meet out there again, I'll kill you, Zagreus.
MegChat09|Meg Chat 09|Megaera|If I have something I decide I wish to tell you, Zagreus, I'll make it clear. Leave me alone.
MegChat10|Meg Chat 10|Megaera|Your father's absolutely right about you, Zag. You are and always will be an insufferable brat.
MegChat11|Meg Chat 11|Megaera|Don't test me any further, Zagreus. You know the rules, no violence in the House.
MegChat12|Meg Chat 12|Megaera|Blood and darkness, leave me be, damn you. I've better things to do than occupy your time.
MegChat13|Meg Chat 13|Megaera|I have to hand it to you, Zag. You've gotten strong. Sending me all the way back here like this.
MegChat14|Meg Chat 14|Megaera|Nyx must be worried, seeing us like this. Lately always at each other's throats.
MegChat15|Meg Chat 15|Megaera|Oh don't worry, I'll be back in fighting shape in no time, Zag.
MegChat16|Meg Chat 16|Megaera|Your father's not been very pleased with my performance lately as you might have guessed.
MegChat17|Meg Chat 17|Megaera|Sometimes, Zagreus, I'm almost not detested by the sight and smell of you.
MegChat18|Meg Chat 18|Megaera|I shouldn't be back here right now. No thanks to you, of course.
MegChat19|Meg Chat 19|Megaera|I'm keeping careful track of all the times you've sent me home like this.
MegChat20|Meg Chat 20|Megaera|At least the House seems well enough in order since I saw it last.
MegChat21|Meg Chat 21|Megaera|We keep on running into one another lately, don't we Zag.
MegChat22|Meg Chat 22|Megaera|You got me fair and square last time. Though I'm a little bitter anyway.
MegChat23|Meg Chat 23|Megaera|You know we can't be seen together like this, Zagreus.
MegChat24|Meg Chat 24|Megaera|I should be whipping Sisyphus' lazy hide right now instead of standing here.
MegChat25|Meg Chat 25|Megaera|Don't like having to come back here quite this often, Zagreus.
MegStandoffish01|Meg Standoffish 01|Megaera|I'm not even remotely interested in chatting with you, Zagreus.
MegStandoffish02|Meg Standoffish 02|Megaera|Why don't you go get out of here if you despise this place so much?
MegStandoffish03|Meg Standoffish 03|Megaera|Don't you so much as dare talk to me.
MegStandoffish04|Meg Standoffish 04|Megaera|Get out of my sight, Zagreus. And be thankful violence is prohibited in here.
MegStandoffish05|Meg Standoffish 05|Megaera|Right now I wouldn't talk to me if I were you.
MegStandoffish06|Meg Standoffish 06|Megaera|I think you'd best be on your way right now, you understand me, Zagreus?
MegStandoffish07|Meg Standoffish 07|Megaera|I think you've wasted quite enough of both our time, don't you?
MegStandoffish08|Meg Standoffish 08|Megaera|Whatever's on your mind, believe me, it's the last thing that I want to hear right now.
MegMaxChat01|Meg Max Chat 01|Megaera|I can't believe you got me like that, Zag. I'm going to get you back.
MegMaxChat02|Meg Max Chat 02|Megaera|Just here licking my wounds until we meet again out there.
MegMaxChat03|Meg Max Chat 03|Megaera|Heard you made it pretty far last time.
MegMaxChat04|Meg Max Chat 04|Megaera|You almost got there last time, didn't you.
MegMaxChat05|Meg Max Chat 05|Megaera|Heard you made it all the way last time.
MegMaxChat06|Meg Max Chat 06|Megaera|You're back. Got all the way to the surface back there, huh?
MegMaxChat07|Meg Max Chat 07|Megaera|Keep letting down my guard against you, Zag.
MegMaxChat08|Meg Max Chat 08|Megaera|Went all the way to the top last time, huh? Not bad at all.
MegMaxChat09|Meg Max Chat 09|Megaera|*Ugh*, I don't remember the last time I beat you, Zag...
MegMaxChat10|Meg Max Chat 10|Megaera|Break's just about over. See you out there?
MegMaxChat11|Meg Max Chat 11|Megaera|Hypnos give you any good pointers lately?
MegMaxChat12|Meg Max Chat 12|Megaera|Taking a break from putting up with Alecto out there...
MegMaxChat13|Meg Max Chat 13|Megaera|Got to say, I like what you and Dusa did with this place.
MegMaxChat14|Meg Max Chat 14|Megaera|Didn't rough you up too bad last time, did I?
MegMaxChat15|Meg Max Chat 15|Megaera|You showed Alecto again. She must be so mad.
MegMaxChat16|Meg Max Chat 16|Megaera|About ready to go another round with me out there?
MegIntermissionChat01|Meg Intermission Chat 01|Megaera|I have to speak with you in private, Zagreus. Urgently.
MegIntermissionChat01|Meg Intermission Chat 01|Megaera|It's fortunate that matter is resolved. I'll see you out there, then.
MegIntermissionChat02|Meg Intermission Chat 02|Megaera|Let's go someplace a little quieter than this. Where we can concentrate.
MegIntermissionChat02|Meg Intermission Chat 02|Megaera|A little peace and quiet's good from time to time, don't you agree?
MegIntermissionChat03|Meg Intermission Chat 03|Megaera|Don't even say a word, and follow me.
MegIntermissionChat03|Meg Intermission Chat 03|Megaera|Well, Zagreus? Take care until we meet again, I guess.
MegIntermissionChat04|Meg Intermission Chat 04|Megaera|Zagreus, did you forget about our private tutoring, again? Come on.
MegIntermissionChat04|Meg Intermission Chat 04|Megaera|There. I take it you'll remember what I've taught you, hm?
MegIntermissionChat05|Meg Intermission Chat 05|Megaera|Come with me, Zagreus. Your chambers are past due for a routine inspection.
MegIntermissionChat05|Meg Intermission Chat 05|Megaera|Well! Seems everything's in order. Carry on.
MegIntermissionChat06|Meg Intermission Chat 06|Megaera|If you're available right now, I have some parchmentwork that needs review.
MegIntermissionChat06|Meg Intermission Chat 06|Megaera|Hmm. Less parchmentwork than I expected. Well, thank you for your time.
MegaeraGift01|Megaera Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey, *uh*, Meg? Look, I know you're just doing your job out there, and, anyway, found this, thought of you and all that, so... here.
MegaeraGift01|Megaera Gift 01|Megaera|I... I'll see to it this contraband is put away at once. Now, take your finder's fee and go about your business.
MegaeraGift02|Megaera Gift 02|Zagreus|Hey, Meg! I, *uh*, thought I'd better hand this over.
MegaeraGift02|Megaera Gift 02|Megaera|I'll confiscate that if you really want. Although, I'm warning you, I'm not susceptible to bribes. Many have tried.
MegaeraGift02|Megaera Gift 02|Zagreus|Hey I'm just handing over contraband to the appropriate authorities, think nothing of it, Meg. Just doing our jobs, right?
MegaeraGift03|Megaera Gift 03|Megaera|*Tsch*. You're serious. You're really giving that to me. I mean, I'll take it off your hands if that is really what you want.
MegaeraGift03|Megaera Gift 03|Zagreus|It's really what I want. And, I sincerely hope we can move past our differences. Not that turning in this contraband has anything to do with that.
MegaeraGift04|Megaera Gift 04|Megaera|Such gifts won't stay my whip when next we meet out there, you realize that, right?
MegaeraGift04|Megaera Gift 04|Zagreus|I realize it. And I hope you never change, Meg.
MegaeraGift05|Megaera Gift 05|Megaera|Flattery won't get you anywhere. We can't go back to how things used to be.
MegaeraGift05|Megaera Gift 05|Zagreus|Flattery never got me anywhere with you to begin with, Meg. Doesn't mean I won't keep trying. I am ever stubborn, aren't I.
MegaeraGift06|Megaera Gift 06|Zagreus|Got you some more of that contraband you like. Don't suppose I could help you put it away or anything...?
MegaeraGift06|Megaera Gift 06|Megaera|Look at me, Zag.... You think that all these gifts will make things go back to the way they were? They won't. It isn't possible. We may be immortals but we're older now.
MegaeraGift06|Megaera Gift 06|Zagreus|I'd hope we're wiser, too.
MegaeraGift07|Megaera Gift 07|Megaera|Ambrosia... you know the penalty for attempting to sway an Overseer of the House of Hades with foreign contraband, don't you?
MegaeraGift07|Megaera Gift 07|Zagreus|I can't entirely say I do, though if it involves lashings and whatnot, I already get more than my share of that, so... figured I would take the risk. So what do you say?
MegaeraGift07|Megaera Gift 07|Megaera|I say hand over the damn bottle. I'll see that it's disposed of properly. Now as for you... you wouldn't know who misplaced something like this, would you? On my authority as Overseer... hang onto it. Though if you tell so much as anyone...!
MegaeraGift08|Megaera Gift 08|Zagreus|I had this awful contraband I wanted to turn in as soon as possible, if you don't mind taking it from me, Meg.
MegaeraGift08|Megaera Gift 08|Megaera|*Tsch*... you still have no idea how to be up front with me, do you, Zag. Why don't you tell me why you're here, and what you want.
MegaeraGift08|Megaera Gift 08|Zagreus|*Erm*... so the whole contraband thing, you aren't buying it, I guess? Although I see you took the bottle there, now, anyway... I wanted just to talk to you. And patch things up, maybe.
MegaeraGift08|Megaera Gift 08|Megaera|*Patch things up*. What is it, by your estimation, that could use repairs, between the two of us, *hm*?
MegaeraGift08|Megaera Gift 08|Zagreus|I... I was naive. I tried not to get too close, but then I did, and said a lot of stupid things, and then... well, we've since tried to kill each other lots of times, there's that. Look, I am sorry, Meg.
MegaeraGift08|Megaera Gift 08|Megaera|You said a lot of stupid things, all right. And we Furies, we're not much for forgiveness or apologies. But... I can see you're making an attempt. Now, thank you for the contraband. Good-bye.
MegaeraGift09|Megaera Gift 09|Zagreus|Here, Meg. Contraband. I wish I could do over how we started.
MegaeraGift09|Megaera Gift 09|Megaera|I, too, wish for a lot of things. Unfortunately there's no unraveling the Fates' patterns. We can learn from our mistakes or keep repeating them. That's it.
MegaeraGift09|Megaera Gift 09|Zagreus|What if I've learned from my mistakes? Have I ever done anything to hurt you since we've been like this? Discounting the unavoidable and frequent fights to the death.
MegaeraGift09|Megaera Gift 09|Megaera|There's nothing you can do to hurt me, Zag. It's just a question of whether you're worth my time.
MegaeraGift09|Megaera Gift 09|Zagreus|Well... am I worth your time, then, Meg?
MegaeraGift09|Megaera Gift 09|Megaera|You know... let me get back to you on that. I need a little time to think it through.
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Zagreus|Hey Meg, you're off duty, aren't you? Look, I was just... hoping you might want to split this with me, best stuff I could find out there, and I would give it all to you, it's just... maybe you wouldn't mind some company. From me.
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Megaera|You sound a little tongue-tied, Zagreus. Just like you always used to around me.
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Zagreus|You're not exactly easy to approach, you know. So... how about it, then? Care for a drink with me?
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Megaera|Open it up, and we can go from there.
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Megaera|...You should have seen the look on your face. You act a lot more confidently now. Though, I think, deep down, you are still that inexperienced little godling that you used to be.
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Zagreus|And I think, deep down, you are not the heartless harbinger of retribution that you want for everyone to think you are. But I can keep your secret if you're willing to keep mine, what do you say?
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Megaera|Tsch... that sounds an awful lot like blackmail, Zagreus. You'd stoop to that, with me?
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Zagreus|No, I... I was just, that's not what I meant at all...
MegaeraGift10|Megaera Gift 10|Megaera|*Hahaha*, I just want to see you squirm. Thanks for the company and for the drink. Guess I'll be seeing you around.
SisyphusFirstMeeting|Sisyphus First Meeting|Sisyphus|Hey, Prince Z. Must look like I'm slacking off with the old boulder, here, but... I was just getting back on my feet. The Fury Sisters don't often leave me be. Where'd they go, anyway? And... what are you doing here?
SisyphusFirstMeeting|Sisyphus First Meeting|Zagreus|Oh, you know, just out on a little stroll is all. Do me a favor, though, you see the Fury Sisters, let them know I was headed down the way I came from, will you...?
SisyphusFirstMeeting|Sisyphus First Meeting|Sisyphus|Oh I'll let them know, all right, I hear you loud and clear, Your Highness. I'll just go about my business now, and you take care.
SisyphusMeeting02_A|Sisyphus Meeting 02 A|Sisyphus|You know, Prince Z., I'd not expected to run into you again, not after all this time. Something amiss down in the House, or what? Not had much company of late, is all.
SisyphusMeeting02_A|Sisyphus Meeting 02 A|Zagreus|Oh, something's just about always amiss back home, sir. Figured it couldn't hurt to check up on things in Tartarus a bit more frequently.
SisyphusMeeting02_A|Sisyphus Meeting 02 A|Sisyphus|Well I am grateful for it, I and the old boulder there, in turn. I'm used to going lengthy stretches on my own, but having visitors from time to time would do me well!
SisyphusMeeting02|Sisyphus Meeting 02|Sisyphus|If I may be so bold, Your Highness, I was wondering... what brings you back around this way again? Same story as last time?
SisyphusMeeting02|Sisyphus Meeting 02|Zagreus|Look, I have to level with you, Sisyphus. I'm leaving the House. I've had quite enough. You understand, I'm sure. I'm going to the surface.
SisyphusMeeting02|Sisyphus Meeting 02|Sisyphus|*Whew*, that is quite an undertaking, Prince. If it wasn't you yourself proposing it, I'd like to call it madness, truth be told. Though you're just mad enough to pull it off! Well hey, I hope you make it. Good fortune out there!
SisyphusMeeting03|Sisyphus Meeting 03|Sisyphus|Hey Prince how goes the old escape plan, any luck?
SisyphusMeeting03|Sisyphus Meeting 03|Zagreus|You know it's been all right, all things considered. Dying now and then, and it's been hard, but hey, what can you do.
SisyphusMeeting03|Sisyphus Meeting 03|Sisyphus|Ah, well, keep your chin up. Me, why I quit trying to get out of here a while back, but, if I was a fire-stepping youngster like yourself, perhaps I would have stuck to it.
SisyphusMeeting04|Sisyphus Meeting 04|Sisyphus|Hey, Your Highness, anything the matter, or just passing through? Happy that we get to chat like this of late, of course.
SisyphusMeeting04|Sisyphus Meeting 04|Zagreus|Sisyphus, don't take this the wrong way, but... why are you helping me? My father's stuck you here for an eternity of torment and even still, you greet me with a smile, time after time.
SisyphusMeeting04|Sisyphus Meeting 04|Sisyphus|*Hah*! Come now, Prince Z., that's just the way I am! Besides, you're not your father, thank the gods! You always seemed a decent lad to me, and if you're saying you want out of here, why, I suppose I can relate, is all.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutFury01|Sisyphus Meeting About Fury 01|Sisyphus|You know, Prince, it's been good not having to see those Fury Sisters quite as much lately. The main one, what's her name, she's on your case now, isn't she.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutFury01|Sisyphus Meeting About Fury 01|Zagreus|You mean Megaera. She's on my case all right. Under strict orders not to let me out of Tartarus. I guess that means you've got yourself a break! About damn time they gave one to you, sir.
SisyphusMeeting05|Sisyphus Meeting 05|Zagreus|Hey, quick question, Sisyphus, you seen the other Fury Sisters lately?
SisyphusMeeting05|Sisyphus Meeting 05|Sisyphus|Not seen the other Fury Sisters in some time now that you mention it! Just Megaera, the kindly one, and she is quite a handful on her own. I'll keep an eye out for the other two!
SisyphusMeeting06|Sisyphus Meeting 06|Zagreus|Sisyphus, how can you stand it, being here like this? You always seem in such good spirits, though.
SisyphusMeeting06|Sisyphus Meeting 06|Sisyphus|You push old Bouldy here sufficient times, and you might get a different outlook on things, too. With the Furies all preoccupied and with my running into you from time to time, I'm positively doing great lately. I like to take what pleasures I can get!
SisyphusMeeting07|Sisyphus Meeting 07|Sisyphus|Look here, Bouldy, Prince Z. himself has come to visit us!
SisyphusMeeting07|Sisyphus Meeting 07|Zagreus|Does Bouldy really keep you company? Personally I would resent a giant boulder that keeps tumbling back down a hill after I push it all the way up there.
SisyphusMeeting07|Sisyphus Meeting 07|Sisyphus|Oh, Bouldy's not so bad, I mean, he's a good listener, a good shoulder to lean on, doesn't wield a whip... I rightly can't complain! Good having company down here.
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Zagreus|You know I was just thinking, sir... sometimes I am a little envious of you and Bouldy there. You seem to have things pretty figured out. I still grow frustrated with myself quite often and don't always know whom to turn to.
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Sisyphus|Oh, *hah*! Well, I just think you're in a tough spot lately, Prince. But you'll get through! As for old Bouldy, why, by all means do not hesitate to lay your troubles on him if you like! Dumped all of mine on him a while back.
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Zagreus|So I can just... walk up and talk to him, and chat? That's all it takes?
SisyphusAboutBouldy01|Sisyphus About Bouldy 01|Sisyphus|That's truly all it takes to make a friend sometimes, indeed, Highness. Now, here.
SisyphusAboutBouldy02|Sisyphus About Bouldy 02|Zagreus|I have to thank you, Sisyphus, not just for all the help you've given me time after time, but for encouraging me to have a chat with Bouldy there. I daresay I feel a little more at peace of late, and maybe it's thanks to him.
SisyphusAboutBouldy02|Sisyphus About Bouldy 02|Sisyphus|He's a good one, all right, isn't he? Though if you've come to such an understanding with old Bouldy there, why, it must mean you've done some growing on your own as well, I think.
SisyphusAboutBouldy03|Sisyphus About Bouldy 03|Sisyphus|Hey, Your Highness, good, old Bouldy there had several things he wanted to tell you.
SisyphusAboutBouldy04|Sisyphus About Bouldy 04|Sisyphus|Hey Prince, ah, so... you do know Bouldy's just a plain old rock with a few lines chiseled into him, resembling a face, don't you? Chiseled into *it*, I mean. Just so you don't get the wrong idea...
SisyphusAboutAlecto01|Sisyphus About Alecto 01|Zagreus|You ever meet Alecto, Sisyphus? The Fury Megaera's nastier sister. We recently became acquainted, she and I.
SisyphusAboutAlecto01|Sisyphus About Alecto 01|Sisyphus|Ah, fortunately I've not seen too much of her, myself, Prince Z. And based on everything that I have seen and heard, I'd like to keep it that way for a while! I hope she doesn't cause you too much trouble there.
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, have you had run-ins with Tisiphone the Fury here before? She isn't much for conversation, I don't think.
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Sisyphus|Tisiphone. Why, yes, I have, in fact, Prince Z. She's visited on multiple occasions, truth be told. So she is back, is she?
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Zagreus|She is. Although, I think she's back to deal with me. I'll have to keep her plenty busy just in case.
SisyphusAboutTisiphone01|Sisyphus About Tisiphone 01|Sisyphus|Appreciate it, Prince. Of all the Fury Sisters, she's the one I would least care to see. But if she does stop by, you know, that's how it goes.
SisyphusMeeting08|Sisyphus Meeting 08|Sisyphus|Look, Prince, I don't hold grudges, you know that. Push this boulder long as I have, you move past the petty stuff. So, just want you to know, in case you make it out this time, it's been a real pleasure.
SisyphusMeeting08|Sisyphus Meeting 08|Zagreus|Feeling's mutual, sir. Someday you'll have to tell me all about how you tricked Father. I might learn a thing or two.
SisyphusBackstory01|Sisyphus Backstory 01|Sisyphus|Say, tell me something, Prince, if you don't mind. How come you're so intent on getting out of here? I mean, what happens when you do?
SisyphusBackstory01|Sisyphus Backstory 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, you ever lose somebody dear to you? There's someone out there whom I need to find. That's... all that I can say right now.
SisyphusBackstory01|Sisyphus Backstory 01|Sisyphus|I get it, Highness, and I didn't mean to pry, it's just... I can't remember what it's like to want something so bad, you know? Whoever's out there, I hope you find them soon.
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Zagreus|Hey sir, I've always wondered, what were you like back when you were alive? Were you always this wise?
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Sisyphus|Might surprise you, Highness, I've a bit of royalty in me, myself. Not on your level, mind, but I was very much a king. Though I'll be honest, I... I wasn't much of a good man.
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Zagreus|*Huh*! I thought I sensed the royalty in you! Although, I can't imagine you as anything besides the gentleman I know you for, my friend.
SisyphusBackstory02|Sisyphus Backstory 02|Sisyphus|Well that is awful kind of you to say. Though, I would like to think my punishment here wasn't without warrant. At least I've had a lot of time to think it through!
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Zagreus|*Erm*, Sisyphus, you mind my asking what you did to warrant this particular arrangement you've got here? Pushing a boulder till the end of time and all. Never heard it in your own words.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Sisyphus|Well, it's a bit of a long story, Prince. My time had come, though I just wasn't ready, you might say. Your father thought he had me in his clutches, but then, *shoom*! I gave him the slip. Your father's henchman, Thanatos, he'll back me up on that.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Zagreus|Outsmarted Thanatos, that's amazing... what happened then?
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Sisyphus|Turns out your father doesn't like us mortals cheating death. Eventually they found me, so, now I'm stuck here with my boulder friend. I push old Bouldy up the hill to the beat of the Furies' whips, then he tumbles down, and then we go again.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Zagreus|So then, you're stuck forever, no reprieve. That's terrible... wish there was something I could do to help.
SisyphusBackstory03|Sisyphus Backstory 03|Sisyphus|You save those sympathies for someone else, Your Highness! I could be Prometheus, spending an eternity having my liver gobbled up, but instead I get to stay in shape, and have these chats with you. Now I'd better get back to it!
SisyphusBackstory04|Sisyphus Backstory 04|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I've meant to ask, where are you getting all this stuff you give to me? You must be pretty well connected around here.
SisyphusBackstory04|Sisyphus Backstory 04|Sisyphus|Oh, well, you know! I have acquaintances amongst the locals here, try to be neighborly with everyone is all. It's not just Bouldy and myself as you can see. Sometimes I come across things that'd be better off in other hands than mine.
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Zagreus|I have to tell you, Sisyphus. Sometimes I wish I knew more about your past. You must have been a great king.
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Sisyphus|Well, *ah-hah*, the thing is that I wasn't, Highness. And that's not modesty from me, all right? All behind me, now. And I'd appreciate it if we left it at that.
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Zagreus|I hear you, sir. Though, whatever you did in your mortal days... you've since more than paid for it, I'm sure.... Wait, is that why you're still here, in Tartarus? Because you think you deserve this?
SisyphusBackstory05|Sisyphus Backstory 05|Sisyphus|It's more like... this is where I belong. Where my path has taken me, you know? Here in the Underworld, you can't entirely escape your past... and yet, it's like you get another life to live. With all the wisdom that you picked up along the way.
SisyphusBackstory06|Sisyphus Backstory 06|Sisyphus|You know, Prince Z., you really have a look about you that you know exactly where you're going, as of late. I used to think you weren't near as comfortable in your own skin.
SisyphusBackstory06|Sisyphus Backstory 06|Zagreus|Oh, you were right. I was never comfortable performing Father's routine Tartarus inspections. Though those responsibilities of mine didn't last long.
SisyphusBackstory06|Sisyphus Backstory 06|Sisyphus|Nor did we have much opportunity to chat back then, but hey! You always struck me as a decent sort. Wasn't accustomed to your father's henchpeople greeting me with a smile.
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I know you tend to be in remarkably good spirits, all things considered, but there must be something I can do to help with your predicament, isn't there?
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Sisyphus|Oh, come now, Prince, do Bouldy and I look like we could use your charity? We're planning to stay put within this chamber for a while. It's hardly a predicament, I'd say.
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Zagreus|But, what of the Furies and their torments and all that? They might be back and make all this more difficult for you.
SisyphusLiberationQuest_Beginning_01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Beginning 01|Sisyphus|Ah, yes, the Fury Sisters, well. I wouldn't mind seeing them more infrequently now that you mention it, but either way! So don't you even worry about me. Now, here.
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Zagreus|I have good news, sir! I located the contract binding you, and bought it out. It's null and void. You're free to go!
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Sisyphus|Oh! Indeed, then, does this mean, Prince, then... the Fury Sisters, they won't come around as often anymore?
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Zagreus|Not just that, Sisyphus! You can make your way someplace else, where other decent shades reside! You know, somewhere with fewer chains and torture devices and such?
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Sisyphus|You're much too kind to this old soul, Prince Z. The thing is, this is home. For me and Bouldy, it is what it is. Though, knowing that the Furies won't be visiting with quite their former regularity, that is a load off. Heavier than Bouldy, there.
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Zagreus|You mean you're really going to stay? Even though you don't have to?
SisyphusLiberationQuestComplete|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Complete|Sisyphus|Is that so odd, Highness? Don't see myself lugging old Bouldy out of here, besides! And if I were to leave, why, we would not be having these exchanges now and then. I happen to enjoy them quite a bit! Now, here you go, and thank you, very much.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 01|Sisyphus|Must say, Prince Z., the free life sure does have its perks down here! This place really isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 01|Zagreus|Glad to hear it, sir. But you're still here... the same as ever. Is it really all that different from the way it always was?
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath01|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 01|Sisyphus|Well, it used to be I'd have to start heaving Bouldy there at any point, if the Fury Sisters decided to show up. But now? I just get to relax, chat a bit with the other shades, and give you one of these when you're in the area!
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath02|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 02|Sisyphus|Ah, there you are, Prince! I was just thinking about how grateful I am that you got me out of that contract with your father. It's been a real weight off my shoulders, truth be told.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath02|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 02|Zagreus|You never seemed particularly concerned even before, sir. Must say you're very good at hiding your worries.
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath02|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 02|Sisyphus|And I could say the same to you! Look, I know you were concerned for my wellbeing. Now you don't have to be. And I'll still be around to help you out. Good feeling, isn't it?
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath03|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 03|Sisyphus|You must have seen everything there is to see here in your father's Underworld, haven't you, Prince? I figure that there isn't any place nicer than this!
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath03|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 03|Zagreus|Oh! Well, I suppose now that you're free, you could always see for yourself? It's pretty different as soon as you reach Asphodel. Don't you have someplace or somebody you'd like to see?
SisyphusLiberationQuestAftermath03|Sisyphus Liberation Quest Aftermath 03|Sisyphus|I'll take what's coming to me right here, thank you very much. You're the wayfaring sort, but my wayfaring days are over. It's hard to explain, but... this is a much-needed fresh start for me.
SisyphusHighRelationship01|Sisyphus High Relationship 01|Sisyphus|I will have you know, Prince, that your visits here have become a very important part of my routine!
SisyphusHighRelationship01|Sisyphus High Relationship 01|Zagreus|And what routine is that, exactly, sir?
SisyphusHighRelationship01|Sisyphus High Relationship 01|Sisyphus|Why, the routine of looking forward, of course! I try to appreciate the moment as much as anybody, but you know? It's always nice having something to look forward to. So, see you next time, then?
SisyphusMeeting_FuryVictorious01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Victorious 01|Sisyphus|I heard straight from the source the Fury Megaera's been giving you a time, there, hasn't she. Trust me I know the feeling, so, I'm grateful that you're here and that she's not. You give her hell for me next time, won't you?
SisyphusMeeting_FuryVictorious01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Victorious 01|Zagreus|Oh I'll get her for the both of us one of these days. Nights? Whenever.
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 01|Sisyphus|Hey Prince, I heard you showed that Fury Sister the what-for, is that the truth? Might explain why I've been left here to my own devices for a change.
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated01|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 01|Zagreus|I don't think she'll be out of commission for very long. She'd best find you minding that boulder, though at least you managed to catch a break for now. Be seeing you, Sisyphus.
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated02|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 02|Sisyphus|Now you be careful out there, Highness. The kindly Megaera is out for blood. She kept on groaning 'bout the last exchange between the two of you. You must have showed her good!
SisyphusMeeting_FuryDefeated02|Sisyphus Meeting Fury Defeated 02|Zagreus|I think I might have gotten lucky.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Sisyphus|Hey, Prince Z., I heard the strangest rumor, here's the thing, I'll give it to you straight. I have heard you've been consorting both with Megaera the Fury and with that old stiff, Thanatos, can you believe it?
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I don't know where you heard that, but... it's true. They're... they're just doing their jobs, and I... I know how it looks, but... you're my friend, as well, and I don't want you to forget that.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Sisyphus|I... look, I do appreciate the sentiment, Your Highness, I'm just surprised. I thought we shared a common foe in them, is all. What can I say, I hope that someday I can see them how you see them.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos01|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 01|Zagreus|Thank you for understanding, sir. Besides... maybe I can get them to cut you some slack.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Zagreus|Sisyphus, I have to be up front with you. The Fury Megaera and Thanatos... I know you're not exactly on the best of terms with either one of them. But they're both close to me. You won't hold it against me, sir, will you?
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Sisyphus|Look, Prince, it's not for me to judge you, or your friends. The Fury Sisters, Master Thanatos... we got off on the wrong foot, you could say. My fault, entirely. I'd sooner make sure that our correspondence here doesn't make those relationships more difficult.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Zagreus|Don't even say that, sir. I think Meg and Than know me better than that by now. Well, thanks for understanding, as always.
SisyphusMeeting_AboutMegAndThanatos02|Sisyphus Meeting About Meg And Thanatos 02|Sisyphus|Certainly, Highness. And who knows? Perhaps as you spend more time together, some of your finer qualities will rub off on those two!
SisyphusAboutThanatosRelationship01|Sisyphus About Thanatos Relationship 01|Sisyphus|How goes it with old Master Thanatos of late, Prince Z.? Is he at least less stern with you than with the poor mortals he's sent to take in here?
SisyphusAboutThanatosRelationship01|Sisyphus About Thanatos Relationship 01|Zagreus|Oh, Thanatos is doing all right. Much like my father, I think he feels he has some sort of fearsome reputation to uphold. Or maybe he's perpetually stressed over his work. But he's been well lately.
SisyphusAboutThanatosRelationship01|Sisyphus About Thanatos Relationship 01|Sisyphus|That's good, I guess! Always appreciated that he ultimately took me in, rather than having to show up here through much more sudden, much more painful means. Didn't stop me from trying to avoid the trip, of course.
SisyphusRunProgress01|Sisyphus Run Progress 01|Sisyphus|Word is you've caused quite the hubbub in Elysium, Prince Z.! Making the champion up there really work for it, I hear?
SisyphusRunProgress01|Sisyphus Run Progress 01|Zagreus|You could say that, I guess! Apparently word gets around. That Theseus, though... he doesn't care for me one bit, let me tell you!
SisyphusRunProgress01|Sisyphus Run Progress 01|Sisyphus|I bet he'd like you better if you were a regular pushover! Ah, well, he'll learn, I'm sure.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Sisyphus|Prince, you've been gone for quite a while, why... I heard-tell you made it all the way outside! And I believed it for a while there, yet here you are. What happened, might I ask?
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|I made it out of here, indeed, sir. I always said that I was leaving, but... turns out there was good reason for me to come back. Not the least of which is visiting my friends from time to time.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Sisyphus|Well, I am certainly delighted to hear that! So long as you achieved what you set out to do. But, what brings you back again this way? More than a social visit I presume.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|You're right. I'm back because... I'm leaving once again. Something I have to do if I get up there, though I should be back before long either way, I guess.
SisyphusRunCleared01|Sisyphus Run Cleared 01|Sisyphus|Going to try and make it out of here again and again, is it? Well they say repetition is the key to mastery, Prince Z. Now here, I'll send you on your way.
SisyphusRunCleared02|Sisyphus Run Cleared 02|Sisyphus|So, how do you like the surface, hey, Prince Z.? Now that you've finally had a chance to see it for yourself. Not too bad, I hope?
SisyphusRunCleared02|Sisyphus Run Cleared 02|Zagreus|It takes some getting used to, that's for sure. I'm not sure I'll ever grow completely accustomed to it. Do you miss it, sir?
SisyphusRunCleared02|Sisyphus Run Cleared 02|Sisyphus|Oh, you know. I still have almost everything that matters, and the rest? It makes for precious memories I didn't have up there.
SisyphusPostEnding01|Sisyphus Post Ending 01|Sisyphus|So, all this time, Prince, when you were battling up to the surface, and all that... you were searching for *her*, weren't you? The Queen?
SisyphusPostEnding01|Sisyphus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|I was. Although, between us, sir, it's important that you keep that one a secret, please. Did... you happen to meet her, ever?
SisyphusPostEnding01|Sisyphus Post Ending 01|Sisyphus|Well, just the one time, briefly, when your father decided to put me here. And, you have my word, of course. About the... surface stuff.
SisyphusPostEpilogue01|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 01|Sisyphus|Prince Z., my understanding is the Queen herself is back, is that correct? Moreover, I have heard a truly fascinating rumor about her...
SisyphusPostEpilogue01|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|That I'm her son...? It's true, sir. And she's back with us for now, indeed. I think we're all still getting used to it, but... it feels good, having her in my life.
SisyphusPostEpilogue01|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 01|Sisyphus|That's wonderful to hear. I'd always heard good things about that one. No wonder such a quality runs in the family.
SisyphusPostEpilogue02|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 02|Sisyphus|Just one thing I don't understand, Prince Z., if you'll indulge me for a moment, here. If everything is all right for you at the House, then... why is it you're fighting to the surface, still?
SisyphusPostEpilogue02|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|Oh, you know. Wouldn't want Father to get too comfortable thinking this place is foolproof. It has a terrifyingly ominous reputation to uphold! *There is no escape*.
SisyphusPostEpilogue02|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 02|Sisyphus|Sure, that makes sense! Well, from a certain point of view. Escape over and over to prove it can't be done! I like that. Well, let's both of us keep at it, then!
SisyphusPostEpilogue03|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 03|Sisyphus|Not working yourself *too *hard of late, are you, Prince Z.? Remembering to take some breaks from time to time, and all?
SisyphusPostEpilogue03|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 03|Zagreus|I think I'm managing, thanks, sir. Though, back when you pushed Bouldy rather than talked to him... I suppose you didn't have much of a choice, did you?
SisyphusPostEpilogue03|Sisyphus Post Epilogue 03|Sisyphus|Well, it was work, you know? Even your Father has to work. Of course, I've since retired! But it seems you and he like to keep yourselves occupied. Whatever makes you feel content.
SisyphusAboutKeepsake01|Sisyphus About Keepsake 01|Sisyphus|Say, that's my Shattered Shackle on your person, right, Prince Z.? I'd recognize that clunky thing from anywhere. It serving you all right?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake01|Sisyphus About Keepsake 01|Zagreus|Hey sir, certainly it's been most welcome having something from you with me at all times. Though has it always held this power? And... how did you remove it to begin with?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake01|Sisyphus About Keepsake 01|Sisyphus|Bit of an odd story, that. Involved a well-timed accident with the old boulder there. Though, I'd best not get into it so that you're not accomplice to that little crime. Surely you understand?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake02|Sisyphus About Keepsake 02|Sisyphus|My Shattered Shackle's practically like new, there, Prince! Minus the part where it's still broken, and all that. Nice work!
SisyphusAboutKeepsake02|Sisyphus About Keepsake 02|Zagreus|Thanks, sir. It's been of help through my repeated treks across this realm, all thanks to you. You sure you don't want it back?
SisyphusAboutKeepsake02|Sisyphus About Keepsake 02|Sisyphus|*Hahahahah*! Absolutely not, though truly I appreciate the sentiment. I'd rather have a look at the old boulder there than a symbol of the time I first got stuck here, when I wasn't doing quite as well.
SisyphusAboutAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Sisyphus About About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Sisyphus|Word is that the most beautiful music's been heard up in Asphodel, lately, Prince! From the sound of it, why... I think that has got to be Eurydice and Orpheus!
SisyphusAboutAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Sisyphus About About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|You heard correctly, Sisyphus! Orpheus is reunited with his muse, at last. Or at least, he gets to visit on the regular, when he isn't busy at my father's house. So you've heard of them, have you?
SisyphusAboutAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Sisyphus About About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Sisyphus|Oh, I've more than heard of them! I'm sure you know how Orpheus once ventured all the way down here, after Eurydice passed on. I'll never forget his song! Even the Fury Sisters gave me a break, they were so captivated by it, then. *Ah*, good times. For me, at least!
SisyphusAboutLegendary01|Sisyphus About Legendary 01|Sisyphus|Prince Z., it seems you've brought my little Shady back to visit me! How very kind. And I can tell he's in good care of late.
SisyphusAboutLegendary01|Sisyphus About Legendary 01|Zagreus|He is, sir, and I'm grateful once again to have adopted him. You sure you don't want him back, though? Always seems like you could use a friend.
SisyphusAboutLegendary01|Sisyphus About Legendary 01|Sisyphus|All due respect, Highness, but I've the best friend anyone can ask for to my right just there. And as for little Shady, he was more inclined than I to see the farthest reaches of the Underworld. Safe travels to you both!
SisyphusAboutLegendary02|Sisyphus About Legendary 02|Zagreus|Sisyphus, sir? Have you any idea how Shady works? I'm able to just whisk both you and Bouldy out of here, and to my aid? It must be awfully disorienting.
SisyphusAboutLegendary02|Sisyphus About Legendary 02|Sisyphus|Well, Prince, I told you that we'd be with you in spirit, didn't I? It's not just Shady's power, I suppose, nor is it Bouldy's or my hidden strength. It's testament to our companionship, is all. You gods are capable of anything!
MegaeraWithSisyphus01_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (1)|Zagreus|She's gone... You still in one piece, Sisyphus? Not hurt or anything?
MegaeraWithSisyphus01_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (1)|Sisyphus|Oh I'm just fine, thanks, Prince. That Fury Sister, she is quite a lass, I have to say, and very, very strong. Bet she could push old Bouldy here better than I!
MegaeraWithSisyphus02_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Zagreus|You've really never gotten Bouldy to the top before?
MegaeraWithSisyphus02_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|Never got the boulder to the top, not even once. Always tumbles down right at the very end. Lost count after the nineteen thousandth time or so, but you know what? One of these days, I bet it's going to stick.
MegaeraWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Zagreus|Sisyphus, did I just hear correctly that Megaera has vowed to leave you be for now? Both you and Bouldy there?
MegaeraWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Why, I believe you heard just that, Your Highness! Seems the Fates are giving me a break. Although, the Fury Sister did declare that she'll be back to haunting me after she's through with you...
MegaeraWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Megaera and Sisyphus (3)|Zagreus|Well, I bet I can keep her busy for a while yet. I'll take it as a bit of good news, sir.
ThanatosWithSisyphus01_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (1)|Sisyphus|Oh, I'm doing very well, thanks, Prince. I'm not afraid of him, I mean, what have I got to lose? Now here, I wanted you to have this.
ThanatosWithSisyphus02_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (2)|Sisyphus|Can you believe the nerve of that one, Prince? He's nothing but a blowhard, so, I simply tell him what he wants to hear! He can't stop me from helping you, besides. I'm dead already, what's he going to do?
ThanatosWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Prince Z.! Just missed your stern-faced colleague, feel that stillness hanging in the air? Sounds like he won't be checking up on me again anytime soon.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Zagreus|Thanatos really isn't such a bad sort once you get to know him, sir. Though, I suppose you'll have to take my word for that.
ThanatosWithSisyphus03_FollowUp|Duo - Thanatos and Sisyphus (3)|Sisyphus|Oh, I believe it, Highness. I should think that bringing death must be a lonely job. Perhaps he ought to try pushing a boulder sometime!
SisyphusChat01|Sisyphus Chat 01|Sisyphus|Good to see you in one piece, Prince Z.!
SisyphusChat02|Sisyphus Chat 02|Sisyphus|Life treating you all right, I take it, Prince?
SisyphusChat03|Sisyphus Chat 03|Sisyphus|Oh I'm hanging in there, thanks for asking, Prince!
SisyphusChat04|Sisyphus Chat 04|Sisyphus|You'll make it out of here, I've no doubt about it!
SisyphusChat05|Sisyphus Chat 05|Sisyphus|Nice of you to drop in for a bit!
SisyphusChat06|Sisyphus Chat 06|Sisyphus|You are a sight for sore eyes, Prince!
SisyphusChat07|Sisyphus Chat 07|Sisyphus|Now you be careful out there, won't you, Prince?
SisyphusChat08|Sisyphus Chat 08|Sisyphus|You give them hell for me, all right, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat09|Sisyphus Chat 09|Sisyphus|Go get them for me, Prince!
SisyphusChat10|Sisyphus Chat 10|Sisyphus|Got just the thing for you here, Prince!
SisyphusChat11|Sisyphus Chat 11|Sisyphus|It's always good to see you, Prince!
SisyphusChat12|Sisyphus Chat 12|Sisyphus|You keep your chin up, Prince!
SisyphusChat13|Sisyphus Chat 13|Sisyphus|Keep fighting the good fight, there, Prince!
SisyphusChat14|Sisyphus Chat 14|Sisyphus|Hey you take care, you hear me, Prince?
SisyphusChat15|Sisyphus Chat 15|Sisyphus|Let's both of us keep going, that a deal?
SisyphusChat16|Sisyphus Chat 16|Sisyphus|It's good of you to visit me like this!
SisyphusChat17|Sisyphus Chat 17|Sisyphus|Hope everything's been well enough of late.
SisyphusChat18|Sisyphus Chat 18|Sisyphus|You watch your step out there, all right, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat19|Sisyphus Chat 19|Sisyphus|Hullo Highness, you're looking well enough!
SisyphusChat20|Sisyphus Chat 20|Sisyphus|Hey, Your Highness, how goes it, how is everything?
SisyphusChat21|Sisyphus Chat 21|Sisyphus|I have to say it's good to see a friendly face!
SisyphusChat22|Sisyphus Chat 22|Sisyphus|Always a pleasure, Highness, you take care out there.
SisyphusChat23|Sisyphus Chat 23|Sisyphus|Here's my best friend in all the Underworld, how goes it, Prince?
SisyphusChat24|Sisyphus Chat 24|Sisyphus|Glad you made it all this way, Prince Z.
SisyphusChat25|Sisyphus Chat 25|Sisyphus|Think I've got just the thing for you right here, Highness!
SisyphusChat26|Sisyphus Chat 26|Sisyphus|A brief hello from time to time does wonders, don't you think, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat27|Sisyphus Chat 27|Sisyphus|Much as I like the company of Bouldy there, you're always welcome, Prince!
SisyphusChat28|Sisyphus Chat 28|Sisyphus|Stop by whenever you're around these parts, all right, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat29|Sisyphus Chat 29|Sisyphus|I know it isn't much, Highness, but I do hope this helps!
SisyphusChat30|Sisyphus Chat 30|Sisyphus|Here's something courtesy of me and Bouldy, Prince!
SisyphusChat31|Sisyphus Chat 31|Sisyphus|How about a little bit of help as you keep on your journey, Prince?
SisyphusChat32|Sisyphus Chat 32|Sisyphus|Let's see if we might make your going slightly easier, there, Prince!
SisyphusChat33|Sisyphus Chat 33|Sisyphus|Should have something that ought to come in handy for you, Prince!
SisyphusChat34|Sisyphus Chat 34|Sisyphus|No need for these, so take one off my hands, won't you, Prince Z.?
SisyphusChat35|Sisyphus Chat 35|Sisyphus|Bouldy and I have got the usual for you right here, Your Highness.
SisyphusChat36|Sisyphus Chat 36|Sisyphus|Highness, please take one of these and go!
SisyphusChat37|Sisyphus Chat 37|Sisyphus|All's well out here in Tartarus, Prince Z.! What will it be?
SisyphusChat38|Sisyphus Chat 38|Sisyphus|Bouldy and I got our usual selection here, Highness!
SisyphusChat39|Sisyphus Chat 39|Sisyphus|Don't let me keep you, Prince, I know you've plenty of important business here.
SisyphusChat40|Sisyphus Chat 40|Sisyphus|Before you go, Prince Z., a little souvenir from your fine stay in Tartarus.
SisyphusChat41|Sisyphus Chat 41|Sisyphus|Don't do anything I wouldn't do out there, you hear me, Prince?
SisyphusChat42|Sisyphus Chat 42|Sisyphus|You're looking good and ready for whatever lies ahead up there, Prince Z.!
SisyphusChat43|Sisyphus Chat 43|Sisyphus|You know approximately where to find me if you happen to be in the area again, Prince Z.!
SisyphusChat44|Sisyphus Chat 44|Sisyphus|Everything's fine as ever here, Prince Z., so you go on ahead, and don't look back!
SisyphusChat45|Sisyphus Chat 45|Sisyphus|I have a feeling you are going to make it all the way topside this time, Highness!
SisyphusChat46|Sisyphus Chat 46|Sisyphus|Need a little pick-me-up perhaps?
SisyphusMaxChat01|Sisyphus Max Chat 01|Sisyphus|Bouldy and I will always be here in your time of need, Prince Z.!
SisyphusMaxChat02|Sisyphus Max Chat 02|Sisyphus|Bouldy says whatever we can do to help, we'll do it, Prince!
SisyphusMaxChat03|Sisyphus Max Chat 03|Sisyphus|In case words of encouragement are not enough, have one of these here, Prince!
SisyphusMaxChat04|Sisyphus Max Chat 04|Sisyphus|Let's get you on your way, Prince Z., and in good spirits, too!
SisyphusMaxChat05|Sisyphus Max Chat 05|Sisyphus|Don't you worry, Highness, we have got you covered here!
SisyphusMaxChat06|Sisyphus Max Chat 06|Sisyphus|Told old Bouldy here you'd probably be back if only to say hi!
SisyphusMaxChat07|Sisyphus Max Chat 07|Sisyphus|Hey Prince, Bouldy and I will not be needing these, but maybe they can help!
SisyphusMaxChat08|Sisyphus Max Chat 08|Sisyphus|Just do the best you can, if you don't mind me saying so, Prince Z.!
SisyphusMaxChat09|Sisyphus Max Chat 09|Sisyphus|Speaking for myself and Bouldy there, we're always at your service, Prince.
SisyphusMaxChat10|Sisyphus Max Chat 10|Sisyphus|You get all the way up to the top and do whatever it is needs getting done, Highness!
SisyphusMaxChat11|Sisyphus Max Chat 11|Sisyphus|I know Bouldy believes in you every bit as much as I do, Prince!
SisyphusGift01|Sisyphus Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey, sir, thought this might ease your burden for a while.
SisyphusGift01|Sisyphus Gift 01|Sisyphus|Now hold a moment, Highness, I cannot accept something like this... not without giving back a little something in return, that is!
SisyphusGift02|Sisyphus Gift 02|Sisyphus|Oh, my, you're really giving that to me, there, Prince? But, I'm just, why would you...?
SisyphusGift02|Sisyphus Gift 02|Zagreus|You better believe it, sir. Now you take care, be seeing you around.
SisyphusGift03|Sisyphus Gift 03|Sisyphus|Why, Prince, you being serious right now, is that for me?
SisyphusGift03|Sisyphus Gift 03|Zagreus|You deserve better, Sisyphus! This really isn't much, but maybe it'll help you while away the days. Nights. Whatever time it is.
SisyphusGift04|Sisyphus Gift 04|Sisyphus|Wow, Your Highness, you... you really shouldn't have. Thank you for not forgetting about me.
SisyphusGift04|Sisyphus Gift 04|Zagreus|You're always a sight for sore eyes out here, Sisyphus. Thank you for always believing in me.
SisyphusGift05|Sisyphus Gift 05|Sisyphus|I'm really very flattered, Highness! You didn't have to get me anything, I mean, your company's more than enough for me!
SisyphusGift05|Sisyphus Gift 05|Zagreus|I figured you could do with something more than that this time around, good sir.
SisyphusGift06|Sisyphus Gift 06|Sisyphus|Oh, but this is just too much for me, Your Highness, thank you, really. I don't know how I can ever repay you.
SisyphusGift06|Sisyphus Gift 06|Zagreus|How about you keep on helping me not die as quickly as I might have otherwise, deal?
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Sisyphus, sir? You've helped me selflessly time after time without so much as asking anything in return. Wanted to say I'm very grateful, and thought you might like to try this. Here, for a special occasion!
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Sisyphus|Why, Prince, is this...? It is...! I've not so much as seen a bottle of it, much less sampled it, thank you so much! Although, with all respect, I cannot rightfully accept such a fine gift. Unless...
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Unless...? Oh no, you're not making me take something in return, you know this was a gift not an exchange, sir, right? Wait, what is that?
SisyphusGift07_A|Sisyphus Gift 07 A|Sisyphus|This, Highness, is a little friend of mine kept tucked away in Bouldy's care. Wherever you'll be going next, he'll make a worthy traveling companion. And when he's with you, Bouldy and I... we'll be with you in spirit, too.
SisyphusGift08_A|Sisyphus Gift 08 A|Sisyphus|Prince, that vintage Ambrosia bottle that you gave me, my! That was the greatest thing I ever tried, I think! Even Bouldy enjoyed the stuff!
SisyphusGift08_A|Sisyphus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|I thought you'd like it, sir. And so, I'm pleased to offer you another! Almost a shame we seldom get such imports from Olympus around here. I hope I can appreciate it for myself sometime. Once all this is over with, I think.
SisyphusGift08_A|Sisyphus Gift 08 A|Sisyphus|What? You mean that you've never touched the stuff yourself? You've much more self control than I have, there. Perhaps someday we'll have a chance to share some between us!
SisyphusGift08_B|Sisyphus Gift 08 B|Sisyphus|Prince, that vintage Ambrosia bottle that you gave me, my! That was the greatest thing I ever tried, I think! Even Bouldy enjoyed the stuff!
SisyphusGift08_B|Sisyphus Gift 08 B|Zagreus|I thought you'd like it, sir. And so, I'm pleased to offer you another! Almost a shame we seldom get such imports from Olympus around here.
SisyphusGift08_B|Sisyphus Gift 08 B|Sisyphus|Ah, look at what the Prince has brought for us, Bouldy! Perhaps someday we'll have a chance to share some between us!
SisyphusGift09_A|Sisyphus Gift 09 A|Sisyphus|All this, for someone such as me. You know I'm down here for a reason, don't you, Prince? Not just because your father and good Thanatos don't care for me. Yet, from the very first, you showed me decency I'd not experienced since I was a king. Perhaps not even then.
SisyphusGift09_A|Sisyphus Gift 09 A|Zagreus|Whoever it was you used to be, sir, I believe you've changed. And I'm proud to say that you're my friend. And Bouldy there as well. It's odd for me to say, but I am glad you're here. I think I've learned a lot from you, about all this.
SisyphusGift09_A|Sisyphus Gift 09 A|Sisyphus|Well, Your Highness, I am honored very much indeed, and having you amongst my list of friends makes it perhaps the greatest such a list a fellow such as I has ever had. Isn't that right, Bouldy?
SisyphusGift07|Sisyphus Gift 07|Sisyphus|Wait, really, this, this is for me, you mean it, Prince? I mean, I won't say no, I can't say no to such a thing, so, thank you! Thank you kindly.
SisyphusGift07|Sisyphus Gift 07|Zagreus|You're more than welcome, sir. For all you've done for me, it's the least I could do.
SisyphusGift08|Sisyphus Gift 08|Sisyphus|...I'm really rather speechless, Your Highness. I'm just a shade doing my time. I don't deserve your generosity.
SisyphusGift08|Sisyphus Gift 08|Zagreus|Come on, sir, what's a priceless bottle of the drink of the gods between friends?
BouldyFirstMeeting|Bouldy First Meeting|Zagreus|*Erm*, Bouldy...? I'm Zagreus, good to make your acquaintance. I know that friends are difficult to come by here in Tartarus, and so, I'm grateful that you seem to be a trusty one.
BouldyMiscMeeting01|Bouldy Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|Bouldy, while on one hand I know that making offerings to you won't really help get me out of here, on the other hand... maybe it will?
BouldyMiscMeeting02|Bouldy Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|Bouldy, how do you handle being trapped in Tartarus for all eternity, doomed to be pushed up and down a hill repeatedly for no good reason?
BouldyMiscMeeting03|Bouldy Misc Meeting 03|Zagreus|So, *erm*, there something you like to do for entertainment out here, Bouldy? Or just, I don't know, take it all in, I guess?
BouldyGiftRepeatable01|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 01|Zagreus|What's the latest, Bouldy? Had any good tumbles down that hill of late?
BouldyGiftRepeatable02|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 02|Zagreus|You know, I think I'm growing more accustomed to relating to a giant stone.
BouldyGiftRepeatable03|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 03|Zagreus|Don't know why I keep doing this, Bouldy, yet here we are.
BouldyGiftRepeatable04|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 04|Zagreus|You take good care of Sisyphus, there, won't you, Bouldy?
BouldyGiftRepeatable05|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 05|Zagreus|Sometimes a conversation with a friend is its own reward, isn't that right, Bouldy?
BouldyGiftRepeatable06|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 06|Zagreus|You're looking as stately as ever, there, Bouldy.
BouldyGiftRepeatable07|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 07|Zagreus|A tribute to the greatest boulder of all time.
BouldyGiftRepeatable08|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 08|Zagreus|To our most famous boulder!
BouldyGiftRepeatable09|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 09|Zagreus|May you roll smoothly for eternity.
BouldyGiftRepeatable10|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 10|Zagreus|Thank you for keeping my friend company.
BouldyGiftRepeatable11|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 11|Zagreus|This is for you, Bouldy.
BouldyGiftRepeatable12|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 12|Zagreus|Bouldy, please accept this humble offering.
BouldyGiftRepeatable13|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 13|Zagreus|Bouldy, lend your favor to me, won't you?
BouldyGiftRepeatable14|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 14|Zagreus|An offering to the finest boulder in all of Tartarus.
BouldyGiftRepeatable15|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 15|Zagreus|Cheers, Bouldy! Thank you for brightening my day or night.
BouldyGiftRepeatable16|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 16|Zagreus|Bouldy, ever get the feeling that we've had this conversation in the past?
BouldyGiftRepeatable17|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 17|Zagreus|Let's be sure to do this again sometime, Bouldy my friend.
BouldyGiftRepeatable18|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 18|Zagreus|Any advice for me on this occasion, Bouldy?
BouldyGiftRepeatable19|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 19|Zagreus|Bouldy, you can speak up if there's something on your mind, you know.
BouldyGiftRepeatable20|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 20|Zagreus|You're always here for me, Bouldy! Cheers.
BouldyGiftRepeatable21|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 21|Zagreus|How's everything going lately, there, Bouldy?
BouldyGiftRepeatable22|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 22|Zagreus|Looks like you and Sisyphus are doing just fine, Bouldy.
BouldyGiftRepeatable23|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 23|Zagreus|Good seeing you as ever, there, Bouldy.
BouldyGiftRepeatable24|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 24|Zagreus|You're a good friend, Bouldy. I'm glad you're here.
BouldyGiftRepeatable25|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 25|Zagreus|You'd tell me if anything was on your mind, right, Bouldy?
BouldyGiftRepeatable26|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 26|Zagreus|Hey Bouldy, what's your favorite color?
BouldyGiftRepeatable27|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 27|Zagreus|Hey Bouldy, what's your favorite form of sustenance?
BouldyGiftRepeatable28|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 28|Zagreus|Hey Bouldy, what do you like to do in your spare time?
BouldyGiftRepeatable29|Bouldy Gift Repeatable 29|Zagreus|Hey Bouldy, how's everything of late?
PatroclusFirstMeeting|Patroclus First Meeting|Patroclus|...Go on, stranger. Plenty more shades looking to fight with you out there.
PatroclusFirstMeeting|Patroclus First Meeting|Zagreus|I'm just passing through. You seem less warlike than the rest. May I ask your name, sir? I'm Zagreus.
PatroclusFirstMeeting|Patroclus First Meeting|Patroclus|Names are there to be forgotten, stranger. You shouldn't be here. May the Fates favor your journey. But just in case they don't, here. Why don't you take this?
PatroclusMeeting02|Patroclus Meeting 02|Zagreus|Is something wrong, there, sir? I mean, shouldn't you be up and about, competing for eternal pride and glory and all that?
PatroclusMeeting02|Patroclus Meeting 02|Patroclus|What's the use? Let's say we fought, if anybody asks. Now, go. I've no quarrel with you, besides. I'll just remain here, comfortably at rest, for some untold millennia, I guess. Have a nice... whatever time it is.
PatroclusMeeting03|Patroclus Meeting 03|Patroclus|Still toiling around within Elysium, I see. Battling my brethren, in the name of glory, is that it?
PatroclusMeeting03|Patroclus Meeting 03|Zagreus|I'm heading for the surface. Though your brethren are slowing me down. Whether for glory or at my father's behest.
PatroclusMeeting03|Patroclus Meeting 03|Patroclus|Your father...? *Ah*, that's right, but you're the Prince, aren't you. You must see plainly, then, what your birthright amounts to: You're no better off than any of us here. Now, go.
PatroclusMeeting04|Patroclus Meeting 04|Patroclus|You again. I told you to stay clear of me. Your father's quite the big shot around here, but that means nothing to me, understand? Go, and tell him he can cast me in the pits of Tartarus, for all I care. It'd be a welcome change of pace from being put to pasture here.
PatroclusMeeting05|Patroclus Meeting 05|Patroclus|I was unkind last time, stranger. Forgive my indiscretions there. Or don't. But I wished to apologize.
PatroclusMeeting05|Patroclus Meeting 05|Zagreus|Think nothing of it, sir. Though if there's something I could do to help, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
PatroclusMeeting05|Patroclus Meeting 05|Patroclus|You have no power to release me from this coil, I'm afraid. So just go on about your business, and leave me to mine.
PatroclusMeeting06|Patroclus Meeting 06|Patroclus|Stranger, I am warning you: If you keep showing up like this, I'm going to have to find a new nickname for you.
PatroclusMeeting06|Patroclus Meeting 06|Zagreus|No need to go out of your way, there, sir. We're just acquaintances. I don't know anything about you, either.
PatroclusMeeting06|Patroclus Meeting 06|Patroclus|And you are better off. This place is for the greatest of the Greeks. Do I seem like the sort to fit in, here? Go on and chat with Theseus, or someone of that sort.
PatroclusMeeting06B|Patroclus Meeting 06 B|Patroclus|Stranger, I am warning you: If you keep showing up like this, I'm going to have to find a new nickname for you.
PatroclusMeeting06B|Patroclus Meeting 06 B|Zagreus|No need to go out of your way, there, sir. I rather feel like a stranger around here. I have no plans to extend my stay.
PatroclusMeeting06B|Patroclus Meeting 06 B|Patroclus|And you are better off. This place is for the greatest of the Greeks. Do I seem like the sort to fit in, here? Go on and chat with Theseus, or someone of that sort.
PatroclusMeeting07|Patroclus Meeting 07|Patroclus|Tell me, stranger, if it pleases you. How is it you keep running into me...? I thought this the remotest corner of Elysium.
PatroclusMeeting07|Patroclus Meeting 07|Zagreus|The ever-shifting chambers of the Underworld leave quite a bit to chance. I took our meetings merely for coincidence.
PatroclusMeeting07|Patroclus Meeting 07|Patroclus|When chance is too far-fetched to be believed, then it's the Fates at play. Or something else. I don't know whether to believe you, but I know that I want you to leave me, now.
PatroclusMeeting07B|Patroclus Meeting 07 B|Patroclus|Tell me, stranger, if it pleases you. How is it you keep running into me...? I thought this the remotest corner of Elysium.
PatroclusMeeting07B|Patroclus Meeting 07 B|Zagreus|The ever-shifting chambers of the Underworld leave quite a bit to chance. I took our meetings merely for coincidence.
PatroclusMeeting07B|Patroclus Meeting 07 B|Patroclus|When chance is too far-fetched to be believed, then it's the Fates at play. Or something else.
PatroclusMeeting08|Patroclus Meeting 08|Patroclus|What is it this time, stranger? You're quite effective at locating me, but not so good at leaving me in peace.
PatroclusMeeting08|Patroclus Meeting 08|Zagreus|Just on one of my little jaunts through paradise is all, sir. Happened to be on the way toward my destination.
PatroclusMeeting08|Patroclus Meeting 08|Patroclus|You think this place a paradise? At least down in the depths, there are so many other souls with whom to share one's misery. No offense... I know that you're just passing through.
PatroclusMeeting09|Patroclus Meeting 09|Patroclus|So, stranger. How goes willful disobedience of late? Would that I, too, had it within me to defy the gods.
PatroclusMeeting09|Patroclus Meeting 09|Zagreus|Oh, you know, it's going. That I've been able to make it this far means I am getting somewhere, I suppose. No thanks to all your brethren in Elysium.
PatroclusMeeting09|Patroclus Meeting 09|Patroclus|No use trying to reason with my brethren here. Many of the shades whom you've encountered, why, I watched them throw away their lives when they were men. Yet still they seek to prove to one another and themselves that they are great warriors.
PatroclusMeeting10|Patroclus Meeting 10|Zagreus|Say, isn't that the Lethe right nearby? You've been through so much, don't you ever... you could just drink deeply of the River of Forgetfulness, and be done with, no?
PatroclusMeeting10|Patroclus Meeting 10|Patroclus|It has been rather tempting, yes. And I have taken sips, from time to time. But I've some memories I'm not quite ready to give up on, yet.
PatroclusMeeting11|Patroclus Meeting 11|Zagreus|You ever want to travel past this glade, sir? Elysium in all its splendors... there's a lot to see. Sure you're all right?
PatroclusMeeting11|Patroclus Meeting 11|Patroclus|I'm sure enough, stranger. I traveled far and wide whilst I drew breath. That got me rid of any wanderlust. This little corner suits me well, I think. I have the statue there, the river... it's quite nice.
PatroclusAboutBracer01A|Patroclus About Bracer 01 A|Patroclus|What is that on your wrist, there, stranger? Let me see, is that... a bracer of the myrmidons. But, then...
PatroclusAboutBracer01A|Patroclus About Bracer 01 A|Zagreus|Wait, this? How did you know? It's just a keepsake from a friend.
PatroclusAboutBracer01A|Patroclus About Bracer 01 A|Patroclus|A keepsake? From a friend...? You tell your friend, then, that Patroclus waits for him, and that he holds no grudge, should he return to him.
PatroclusAboutBracer01B|Patroclus About Bracer 01 B|Patroclus|What is that on your wrist, there, stranger? Let me see, is that... a bracer of the myrmidons. But, then...
PatroclusAboutBracer01B|Patroclus About Bracer 01 B|Zagreus|You recognize it, then. Of course. It's from Achilles, sir. He gifted it to me. He trained me.
PatroclusAboutBracer01B|Patroclus About Bracer 01 B|Patroclus|I see... a gift. Well, then, you let Achilles know Patroclus waits for him, and holds no grudge, should he return to him.
PatroclusAboutBracer01E|Patroclus About Bracer 01 E|Patroclus|What is that on your wrist, there, stranger? Let me see, is that... a bracer of the myrmidons. Achilles...
PatroclusAboutBracer01E|Patroclus About Bracer 01 E|Zagreus|This is his bracer, yes. You recognize it, then. Were you a myrmidon, yourself? I heard they were unstoppable.
PatroclusAboutBracer01E|Patroclus About Bracer 01 E|Patroclus|Well, now... if we were so unstoppable, we'd not be here, would we? May that bracer protect you more than its like protected our phalanxes.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect01|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 01|Patroclus|Must say that's an impressive spear you've got, there, stranger. Rather like the one Achilles held. He gave it to you, then? Followed him beyond the grave, only to be handed off.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect01|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 01|Zagreus|It's... a bit more complicated than that, sir, though yes. This is the very same as he once wielded. I am honored to carry it now.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect01|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 01|Patroclus|I'll bet. Perhaps you'll even come to surpass the body count Achilles piled up with it back in his day, seeing as you seem to have limitless opportunity to use it.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect02|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 02|Patroclus|You know, stranger, there was a time Achilles would have killed someone for taking up his spear. But there you are, like you own it.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect02|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 02|Zagreus|I don't think anybody owns this spear, sir. I'm hanging onto it for the time being. Though I don't think I'll be the last to do so.
PatroclusAboutAchillesAspect02|Patroclus About Achilles Aspect 02|Patroclus|Oh, there's no need to get all philosophical about it. It's a killing weapon. Nothing more.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|You mentioned something of your parentage, stranger. I have a question on that subject, if you please.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Zagreus|I please, sir. What's your question? Ask away.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|Your father must have records of the dead. So I was wondering if you might do for me a favor, and look up the whereabouts of someone I once knew.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Zagreus|You've done a lot for me. The least I can do is ask around. Who is it that you're looking for?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|I seek one called Achilles. Was rather famous once among the living, but among the dead, who knows. I thought he would be here, but he is not.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Zagreus|...Achilles... I've heard the name before. And, *erm*, can I ask why you wish to know of him? In case it happens to come up.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01A|Patroclus About Achilles 01 A|Patroclus|It's just... I simply miss him, stranger. That is all.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Patroclus|Something the matter, there, stranger? Or have you come to torment me some more with idle chat?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Zagreus|You know Achilles, don't you, sir. You're Patroclus. Achilles... serves us at my home. He trained me. He sends you his regards and love. He says to tell you he is thinking of you always.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Patroclus|...That name. So then you've seen him, have you. In your father's house. And want me to believe he said all that? *Tsk*. You'll forgive me if I am a little skeptical. In life, I left Achilles. And in death, he left me. We're even. And we've nothing left to say to one another, now.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Zagreus|But, that can't possibly be true. There must be some misunderstanding here. You haven't spoken since you died?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01B|Patroclus About Achilles 01 B|Patroclus|We haven't, no. And I don't think we shall. But, you can humor him for me, I guess. Tell him I'm doing perfectly all right, won't you?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Patroclus|Something the matter, there, stranger? Or have you come to torment me some more with idle chat?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Zagreus|Patroclus. I know who you are, sir. And, you know Achilles. He serves us at my home. He trained me. He sends you his regards and love. He says to tell you he is thinking of you always.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Patroclus|...*Ah*. So then you've seen him, have you. In your father's house. And want me to believe he said all that? *Tsk*. You'll forgive me if I am a little skeptical. In life, I left Achilles. And in death, he left me. We're even. And we've nothing left to say to one another, now.
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Zagreus|But, that can't possibly be true. There must be some misunderstanding here. You haven't spoken since you died?
PatroclusAboutAchilles01C_01|Patroclus About Achilles 01 C 01|Patroclus|We haven't, no. And I don't think we shall. But, you can humor him for me, I guess. Tell him I'm doing perfectly all right, won't you?
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Patroclus|So, how's Achilles doing lately, stranger? I figured you could tell me since you've all this access to him, and I don't.
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Zagreus|He's forced to do my father's bidding. And sworn to secrecy, apparently. I don't pretend to fully understand. But, all in all, I think he's doing well. I hope... you'll see him for yourself.
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Patroclus|You don't fully understand, but hope. I see. Well, if you do get to the bottom of this little mystery at some point, you'll indulge me, won't you?
PatroclusAboutAchilles02|Patroclus About Achilles 02|Zagreus|I'll... see what I can do about it, sir.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Patroclus|He's never going to return to me, is he. He's in your father's service now. He's never getting out. Neither are you.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Zagreus|No. That's not acceptable to me. None of it.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Patroclus|How bold. So what do you intend to do? You're leaving, anyway.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Zagreus|I'll figure something out. But you do something for me, in the mean time: Don't give in to what you're feeling now, all right? Achilles loves you still, like you don't know.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03A|Patroclus About Achilles 03 A|Patroclus|Does he? I'm past the point of making promises, but... I pray the Fates help you in your endeavors, there.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Patroclus|He's never going to return to me, is he. He's in your father's service now. He's never getting out. Neither are you.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Zagreus|No. That's not acceptable to me. None of it.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Patroclus|How bold. So what do you intend to do? You're leaving, anyway.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Zagreus|I'll figure something out. But you do something for me, in the meantime: Don't give in to what you're feeling now, all right? Achilles loves you still, like you don't know.
PatroclusAboutAchilles03B|Patroclus About Achilles 03 B|Patroclus|I'm past the point of making promises, but... thank you for your words. I love him still, in turn. I pray the Fates help you in your endeavors, there.
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Patroclus|He's just as obstinate as ever, isn't he? Always refused to budge. He ever tell you of the war in which we fought? *I *fought, I should say. He could have ended it. But he refused to take up arms.
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Zagreus|Achilles hasn't been particularly forthcoming about his mortal days, no. So he wouldn't fight? I've heard that mortals sometimes frown on that, but... why should he have fought if he didn't believe in the cause?
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Patroclus|He *shared *our cause! So what if it was not completely his? If not for his stubbornness, I... well... I would have come here just a bit later, I think.
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Zagreus|He blames himself for what happened to you, you know. I figured he failed to defend you or something, not that... he didn't fight at all. Although, he said something about how, once you died, he shortly followed in a rage...
PatroclusAboutAchilles04|Patroclus About Achilles 04|Patroclus|I wouldn't know a thing about that, stranger, for you see... I was already dead. Getting my place here in the afterlife all sorted out. Took quite some time, getting accustomed to all this.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Patroclus|A question, if you don't mind, stranger? Because, I've had one nagging at me since we last discussed the subject. What, exactly, happened to Achilles, can you say? After I died, that is. I've heard the rumors, but... I don't trust any of this boastful lot.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Zagreus|Well, from what I gathered, sir... after you fell, he was overcome with grief. And anger. He joined the war, just like you urged. And, single-handedly, he almost ended it.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Patroclus|So then, he threw away his life. Soon enough after I lost mine. Yet, despite vanquishing an army on his own, he wound up in the lowest pits of Tartarus? Instead of here, among the great?
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Zagreus|You should know, sir. You were buried together. Your ashes, that is. It was his final request. As for how he came to be at my father's house, that's something I think he can best explain. And I will do everything I can to make sure that he has the opportunity.
PatroclusAboutAchilles05|Patroclus About Achilles 05|Patroclus|...Our ashes, you say. Together? *Tsk. *The fool. We could have lived! Not been reduced to meal for the worms. But... I appreciate the information, stranger. Now... please, go.
PatroclusAboutAchilles06|Patroclus About Achilles 06|Patroclus|...Forgive me, stranger. For, in retrospect, I was too terse after you told me what became of my Achilles. Tales of his climactic battle, I had heard. The stuff about... his ashes, and my own... that was all new.
PatroclusAboutAchilles06|Patroclus About Achilles 06|Zagreus|No need to even ask forgiveness, sir. Achilles is one of my closest friends, but.. he doesn't care to talk about himself. About those times. It must be very painful. For the both of you.
PatroclusAboutAchilles06|Patroclus About Achilles 06|Patroclus|Oh, we've all seen our share of pain, by now. But... knowing that he cared for me, in the end... *after *the end... it dulls the feeling of it, for a bit. As do these conversations, I guess.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|I've meant to ask you something, stranger. Would you mind doing me a favor, please? If it happens to come up along your path. Suppose I ought to tell it to you first, prior to asking a response.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|No, of course, sir, what is it? What's on your mind?
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|If I know my Achilles, then he's being rather guarded, when it comes to this predicament we're in. How can somebody be so brash yet hate to take unnecessary risks? Just let him know I said to risk it all.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Risk it all? Risk *what *all? He wants what's best for you. He wouldn't want anything to happen.
PatroclusAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|It's already long since happened. I daresay that, right now, provided what you've said is true, then... it appears we've more to gain than lose. Isn't fear for the weak?
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (1)|Achilles|I thought we might run into you, but... how strange to see you face-to-face out here, lad. To see this place myself. I still can't quite believe any of this...
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (1)|Patroclus|He really can't. Though I keep telling him, it's true. Nothing's accomplished without risk, isn't that so? But, we of course have you to thank, stranger. Our troubles needn't have been your concern.
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (1)|Zagreus|Nonsense, sir. You're my friend. And Achilles... I don't know where I would even be, if not for you.
PatroclusWithAchilles01|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (1)|Patroclus|Well, no need to get emotional, is there? We myrmidons, we're not the sentimental type. Achilles is simply on break, is all. From a demanding job. You've a demanding job as well, so here! My customary gift.
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (2)|Patroclus|Well if it isn't the ward of Achilles, come to visit us. I don't know how I can ever repay you, stranger. I'm quite sure that it isn't possible.
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (2)|Achilles|I reached more or less the same conclusion, Pat.
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (2)|Zagreus|How about you just keep offering me those premium goods you have no interest in when I pass through, and we can call it even, sir?
PatroclusWithAchilles02|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (2)|Patroclus|That I had plans to do, regardless, though... if you should think of something else at any point, please do let either of us know.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (3)|Patroclus|Good, there you are, stranger. Settle something for us quickly, hm? Would Achilles not make for the perfect Champion of Elysium? For I think almost anybody would be better than the current one.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (3)|Achilles|I think I'd rather maintain watch over a nearly empty hall than battle all the shades around here, Pat.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (3)|Zagreus|I, too, would vastly prefer having to contend with Theseus rather than yourself, Achilles. Although, that's not to say I disagree that almost anybody would be better in the role than him.
PatroclusWithAchilles03|Duo - Patroclus and Achilles (3)|Patroclus|It seems, then, I am overruled. But I know Champion material when I see it, and I see it now.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|Achilles is returned to work for now... but, waiting for him, knowing he'll return... rather than waiting for the sake of it, for nothing... such a different feeling, stranger. I'd forgotten it entirely, I think.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|I'm happy for the both of you. So, is everything all right, then? The circumstances under which you were separated in life... it's unimaginable, really. How does one move on from a thing like that?
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Patroclus|Anger fades, I guess, stranger. Even the famous anger of Achilles. Anger burns hot, then burns out. What's left is a dull ache, but... underneath it, there was something else. It felt as though... well, I was still alive. That feeling... it's worth holding onto.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Patroclus|It's good to see you again, stranger. You don't mind if I keep calling you that, no? Couldn't find a better nickname for you, after all. Besides... I don't want to cause you any trouble.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|Don't mind at all, Patroclus, sir. Coming from you I consider it a term of endearment.
PatroclusAfterMyrmidonReunionQuest02|Patroclus After Myrmidon Reunion Quest 02|Patroclus|You have my thanks for that...
PatroclusPostEnding01|Patroclus Post Ending 01|Patroclus|Achilles tells me that you're here to stay, at least for now, stranger. A welcome bit of news. Assuming, of course, that it's for the best, for you?
PatroclusPostEnding01|Patroclus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|I think so, sir. I'll still be passing through, and visiting the surface every opportunity I get. But it seems my place really is here. Besides, it means getting to see you every now and then, like this.
PatroclusPostEnding01|Patroclus Post Ending 01|Patroclus|That sounds agreeable to me. Then, you take care.
PatroclusPostEpilogue01|Patroclus Post Epilogue 01|Patroclus|There's been considerable talk of late about the Queen Persephone, stranger. Your mother, it would seem? Sounds to me your tale's almost as complicated as my own.
PatroclusPostEpilogue01|Patroclus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|It's a long story, at this point, indeed. But yes. The Queen... my mother... she's returned. And, it's been really good, having her back.
PatroclusPostEpilogue01|Patroclus Post Epilogue 01|Patroclus|I can only begin to imagine. May she help govern all of this with wisdom and with grace.
PatroclusAboutKeepsake01|Patroclus About Keepsake 01|Zagreus|This spearpoint that you gave me, sir. It's been quite useful, though I have to ask you... is there any particular significance to it? Most spearpoints aren't imbued with power such as this.
PatroclusAboutKeepsake01|Patroclus About Keepsake 01|Patroclus|Oh, that. Just something I'd been meaning to get rid of, but... it can be difficult, discarding trifles from the past. Knowing it's provided you some benefit is welcome news.
PatroclusAboutKeepsake02|Patroclus About Keepsake 02|Zagreus|Did you once wield a spear yourself, sir? In your fighting days?
PatroclusAboutKeepsake02|Patroclus About Keepsake 02|Patroclus|Did I once wield a spear? You could say that I did. I had my moments with it, anyway. Even once slew a demigod! He's probably somewhere about. Quite awkward, running into those you killed. But in Elysium it's all taken in stride.
PatroclusAboutWar01|Patroclus About War 01|Zagreus|Whatever happened with that war you mentioned, sir? If you don't mind my asking.
PatroclusAboutWar01|Patroclus About War 01|Patroclus|Well, truth be told, here, stranger... I do mind. You speak as one who's not experienced a war. Those of us who survived... or, you know what I mean... we do bear some responsibility to history. But, all the same, it's not a time and place to which I would return. I trust you'll understand.
PatroclusAboutYoungAchilles01|Patroclus About Young Achilles 01|Zagreus|I always wondered, sir. What was Achilles like...? During his youth, I mean. If you can say.
PatroclusAboutYoungAchilles01|Patroclus About Young Achilles 01|Patroclus|*Hah*. How to describe what somebody was like? Everyone who saw him on the battlefield agreed he was magnificent, stranger. His allies and his enemies alike. But, there was more to him, I think. A certain outlook. A sense of justice. I knew him before he was a warrior. Only reason I suppose I liked him.
PatroclusAboutTheseus01|Patroclus About Theseus 01|Patroclus|I heard you've vanquished Theseus however many times of late. Or... someone matching your description has, stranger. Almost had to laugh when I heard that. Though, I suspect he hasn't learnt a thing.
PatroclusAboutTheseus01|Patroclus About Theseus 01|Zagreus|What, you know him? Though, yes, he does seem rather set in his ways. Convinced himself that I'm some sort of demon from the lowest depths. Which... well, it's partly true, I guess.
PatroclusAboutTheseus01|Patroclus About Theseus 01|Patroclus|You're quite notorious, around these parts. The tales of your father's monstrous son, kept under lock and key within his House. Fear and ignorance make for great stories, no?
PatroclusAboutTheseus02|Patroclus About Theseus 02|Patroclus|Couldn't help but hear the rattling of battle chariots of late. Raucous laughter and the like. You've really riled up the locals this time, stranger.
PatroclusAboutTheseus02|Patroclus About Theseus 02|Zagreus|Must be Theseus and his fancy Macedonian. So he's been joyriding about in that thing? Showing it off?
PatroclusAboutTheseus02|Patroclus About Theseus 02|Patroclus|Your arrivals are becoming a bit of an event, I'd say. And, yes, the Champion and his bull friend are likely at the center of it. You'll have to forgive me that I've no intent on attending your contests, but... well, here.
PatroclusAboutTheseus03|Patroclus About Theseus 03|Zagreus|You know, for such a loudmouth obnoxious braggart, Theseus does seem to have formed a strong kinship with the Bull of Minos, hasn't he. Are they truly as inseparable as they seem? I feel bad for the Bull.
PatroclusAboutTheseus03|Patroclus About Theseus 03|Patroclus|Sometimes it's our differences that make us drawn to one another, no? And, at other times, there's no accounting for taste. I often don't know which is which, and they can have each other, far as I'm concerned.
PatroclusAboutMinotaur01|Patroclus About Minotaur 01|Patroclus|Even the Bull of Minos couldn't stop you, huh. That's one whose way I would stay out of if I could, but... well, you'd not be here if you couldn't handle yourself, I guess.
PatroclusAboutMinotaur01|Patroclus About Minotaur 01|Zagreus|You heard I battled with Asterius, here, sir? I thought you kept more to your own devices. Weren't much for conversation with the other shades.
PatroclusAboutMinotaur01|Patroclus About Minotaur 01|Patroclus|Oh, you're correct in that assessment, stranger. But, as you've seen, I've no ability to stop others from coming and going as they please. So I do tend to hear a thing or two from passersby.
PatroclusAboutHeroes01|Patroclus About Heroes 01|Zagreus|You must have met so many great heroes in your day, having fought alongside Achilles... do you still keep in touch with any of them, here?
PatroclusAboutHeroes01|Patroclus About Heroes 01|Patroclus|Great heroes... haven't you seen, by now, what they are like, stranger? Not all entirely what they're cracked up to be. But, there were good ones, yes. Suppose they're mostly keeping to themselves. Like I am here. Perhaps we'll run into each other, down the line.
PatroclusAboutGods01|Patroclus About Gods 01|Patroclus|Never quite considered... you're related to the gods upon Olympus, aren't you, stranger...? I should be far more careful around you.
PatroclusAboutGods01|Patroclus About Gods 01|Zagreus|What do you mean by that, sir? Though, yes, my father being who he is, it means I have a lot of uncles, cousins, and the like, up on the surface, there.
PatroclusAboutGods01|Patroclus About Gods 01|Patroclus|Well... you would be wise to watch yourself, with some of them, I think. Don't get on anyone's bad side, if you can help it. Which, when I yet lived, none of us could.
PatroclusAboutLove01_A|Patroclus About Love 01 A|Patroclus|You ever been in love with someone, stranger? Might be a mortals-only thing, for all I know. You gods have strange relationships, I hear.
PatroclusAboutLove01_A|Patroclus About Love 01 A|Zagreus|I have been, sir. Or, I should say, I am.
PatroclusAboutLove01_A|Patroclus About Love 01 A|Patroclus|Ah, that's good. Cling to the feeling, then. And if you lose it... reach for it. Search for it, no matter what, all right? Because, without it... well, there isn't much of a comparison, I think.
PatroclusAboutLove01_B|Patroclus About Love 01 B|Patroclus|You ever been in love with someone, stranger? Might be a mortals-only thing, for all I know. You gods have strange relationships, I hear.
PatroclusAboutLove01_B|Patroclus About Love 01 B|Zagreus|Not sure that I have been, sir. I understand it's one of those things where, you'll know it when it happens.
PatroclusAboutLove01_B|Patroclus About Love 01 B|Patroclus|Perhaps you shall, someday or night down here. The feeling comes with pain, and plenty of it, but... the pain is worth it, in my limited experience. And once you find that feeling, cling to it. As tightly as you can. If you don't mind my saying.
PatroclusAboutTrinkets01|Patroclus About Trinkets 01|Patroclus|Well, what's it going to be this time, stranger? The HydraLite? Maybe the Kiss of Styx?
PatroclusAboutTrinkets01|Patroclus About Trinkets 01|Zagreus|You sure you don't need any of this stuff, sir? I really appreciate it, but... I don't want to take it for granted.
PatroclusAboutTrinkets01|Patroclus About Trinkets 01|Patroclus|Oh, come, this is Elysium. Taking such things for granted is the point. We gloried shades receive our stipend of the finest goods, so we can battle till we've had our fill. But I've already had my fill, I think.
PatroclusAboutFishing01|Patroclus About Fishing 01|Patroclus|You've ample time for fishing, have you, stranger? And here I thought you'd more important business to attend to, though it's not for me to judge, I guess.
PatroclusAboutFishing01|Patroclus About Fishing 01|Zagreus|I'll have you know some of us take matters of fishing very seriously, sir! Besides... helps take my mind off having to fight your Elysian brethren nonstop.
PatroclusAboutFishing01|Patroclus About Fishing 01|Patroclus|Oh I'd not take your mind off this fight if it's one that you hope to win, stranger. I once took my mind off a fight, and, well... I wound up here.
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Zagreus|I have to tell you, sir, it was a real sight to see you fighting alongside Achilles. You two were amazing!
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Patroclus|Oh, I'm a little rusty. But he's not. Still very much in tiptop shape, except more able to control his temper, I should think.
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Zagreus|Don't sell yourself so short! Though, I thought you laid down your spear forever. Why choose to fight again?
PatroclusAboutLegendary01|Patroclus About Legendary 01|Patroclus|Achilles swayed me into realizing some activity may be quite good for me. And besides... if we can aid you in a pinch, that's worth my while.
PatroclusLowHealth01|Patroclus Low Health 01|Patroclus|You look positively beaten, there, stranger. Let's see if we can't get you on your feet. For I can do the listless sitting for the both of us.
PatroclusLowHealth02|Patroclus Low Health 02|Patroclus|Oh, you look terrible, if I may say, stranger. Perhaps one of these trinkets can be of some small help.
PatroclusChat01|Patroclus Chat 01|Patroclus|You again? Then, here. Fates know I'll not be needing this.
PatroclusChat02|Patroclus Chat 02|Patroclus|Move right along, stranger. Let's skip the pleasantries.
PatroclusChat03|Patroclus Chat 03|Patroclus|And here I thought you must have given up already.
PatroclusChat04|Patroclus Chat 04|Patroclus|Enjoying the splendors of Elysium, yet, stranger?
PatroclusChat05|Patroclus Chat 05|Patroclus|Don't let me interrupt your stay in paradise, stranger.
PatroclusChat06|Patroclus Chat 06|Patroclus|Returned to take more of these trinkets off my hands, have you?
PatroclusChat07|Patroclus Chat 07|Patroclus|Oh, it's only you again, stranger. It's only me, as well.
PatroclusChat08|Patroclus Chat 08|Patroclus|Take one of these and then just leave me be, stranger.
PatroclusChat09|Patroclus Chat 09|Patroclus|I'd like to be alone again, stranger, so you go on ahead.
PatroclusChat10|Patroclus Chat 10|Patroclus|No need to linger with me, stranger. Go.
PatroclusChat11|Patroclus Chat 11|Patroclus|Why your path keeps on crossing mine, I've not the slightest clue.
PatroclusChat12|Patroclus Chat 12|Patroclus|Some other time, stranger. Right now I'm preoccupied with sitting here.
PatroclusChat13|Patroclus Chat 13|Patroclus|There's nothing you can do to help me, stranger.
PatroclusChat14|Patroclus Chat 14|Patroclus|Can't you see I'm busy whiling away for all eternity?
PatroclusChat15|Patroclus Chat 15|Patroclus|A fine whatever time it is to you, stranger.
PatroclusChat16|Patroclus Chat 16|Patroclus|You haven't lost your will just yet, I see.
PatroclusChat17|Patroclus Chat 17|Patroclus|Expecting I'll still be right here next time, stranger.
PatroclusChat18|Patroclus Chat 18|Patroclus|Just go, already, towards your next death or whatever else awaits.
PatroclusChat19|Patroclus Chat 19|Patroclus|You're back again, I see. And just in time to take one of these blasted things from me.
PatroclusChat19|Patroclus Chat 19|Patroclus|I'll wait for him, however long it takes. You tell him that.
PatroclusChat20|Patroclus Chat 20|Patroclus|I pray Achilles is surviving well. And same for you.
PatroclusChat21|Patroclus Chat 21|Patroclus|It's good of you to visit, though there's little I can offer in return.
PatroclusChat22|Patroclus Chat 22|Patroclus|Please make yourself at home here in this corner of eternal paradise.
PatroclusChat23|Patroclus Chat 23|Patroclus|Do let Achilles know I'm doing well, and I'll be ever patient, here.
PatroclusChat24|Patroclus Chat 24|Patroclus|I doubt there's much that I can do for you.
PatroclusChat25|Patroclus Chat 25|Patroclus|You're interfering with my quiet time, you know.
PatroclusChat26|Patroclus Chat 26|Patroclus|Yes, what is it, this time?
PatroclusChat27|Patroclus Chat 27|Patroclus|Here's what I have that I can spare right now.
PatroclusChat27|Patroclus Chat 27|Patroclus|Might I somehow assist you, then?
PatroclusChat28|Patroclus Chat 28|Patroclus|Oh good, somebody's here to save me from myself.
PatroclusChat29|Patroclus Chat 29|Patroclus|How can I be of use to you, stranger?
PatroclusChat30|Patroclus Chat 30|Patroclus|I've no shortage of time to spare, I guess.
PatroclusChat31|Patroclus Chat 31|Patroclus|Ah, just a stranger passing through, I see.
PatroclusChat32|Patroclus Chat 32|Patroclus|Not in the mood for conversation now, stranger.
PatroclusChat33|Patroclus Chat 33|Patroclus|Go on about your business, there, stranger.
PatroclusChat34|Patroclus Chat 34|Patroclus|Good fortune getting out of here, stranger.
PatroclusChat35|Patroclus Chat 35|Patroclus|Here's something for the journey still to come.
PatroclusChat36|Patroclus Chat 36|Patroclus|Prepared to face the champion, soon, stranger?
PatroclusChat37|Patroclus Chat 37|Patroclus|May this aid you against the champion, out there.
PatroclusChat38|Patroclus Chat 38|Patroclus|Be careful with my brethren out there, stranger.
PatroclusChat39|Patroclus Chat 39|Patroclus|Battle with glory and all that, all right, stranger?
PatroclusChat40|Patroclus Chat 40|Patroclus|I would prefer to be alone for now, stranger.
PatroclusChat41|Patroclus Chat 41|Patroclus|Just don't go starting any wars you don't intend to finish, stranger.
PatroclusStandoffish01|Patroclus Standoffish 01|Patroclus|Leave me be to my eternal paradise, damn you.
PatroclusStandoffish02|Patroclus Standoffish 02|Patroclus|I shall not take up arms again, stranger, not even against you.
PatroclusStandoffish03|Patroclus Standoffish 03|Patroclus|Begone from here, we've nothing to discuss.
PatroclusStandoffish04|Patroclus Standoffish 04|Patroclus|Go haunt some other corner of this realm; this one is mine.
PatroclusStandoffish05|Patroclus Standoffish 05|Patroclus|I thought I told you to leave me alone?
PatroclusStandoffish06|Patroclus Standoffish 06|Patroclus|Do I look like I want to talk to you?
PatroclusStandoffish07|Patroclus Standoffish 07|Patroclus|What is it that you want from me this time?
PatroclusStandoffish08|Patroclus Standoffish 08|Patroclus|What would it take for you to leave me be?
PatroclusStandoffish10|Patroclus Standoffish 10|Patroclus|What would you have me do?
PatroclusReunionChat01|Patroclus Reunion Chat 01|Patroclus|It's good to see you once again, stranger. Now, here.
PatroclusReunionChat02|Patroclus Reunion Chat 02|Patroclus|We're faring well enough, and may you fare the same.
PatroclusReunionChat03|Patroclus Reunion Chat 03|Patroclus|You've come to be a welcome sight, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat04|Patroclus Reunion Chat 04|Patroclus|May you prevail in your battles still to come, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat05A|Patroclus Reunion Chat 05 A|Patroclus|We were just wondering when you'd arrive, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat05|Patroclus Reunion Chat 05|Patroclus|Achilles and I were just passing the time I guess.
PatroclusReunionChat06|Patroclus Reunion Chat 06|Patroclus|I and Achilles here still have a lot of catching up to do.
PatroclusReunionChat07|Patroclus Reunion Chat 07|Patroclus|Fight like my friend here used to fight, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat08|Patroclus Reunion Chat 08|Patroclus|May all your fears leave you behind once you walk past that door.
PatroclusReunionChat09|Patroclus Reunion Chat 09|Patroclus|You'll show that champion of ours, won't you, stranger?
PatroclusReunionChat10|Patroclus Reunion Chat 10|Patroclus|I'm pleased to be of any help at all.
PatroclusReunionChat11|Patroclus Reunion Chat 11|Patroclus|First a visit from Achilles, and now you.
PatroclusReunionChat12|Patroclus Reunion Chat 12|Patroclus|Please stay as long as you would like here in our little glade.
PatroclusReunionChat13|Patroclus Reunion Chat 13|Patroclus|Take caution with our battle-loving brethren around here.
PatroclusReunionChat14|Patroclus Reunion Chat 14|Patroclus|If you can make yourself at home in such a place, please do, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat15A|Patroclus Reunion Chat 15 A|Patroclus|Just restocked on these battle-trinkets, if you'd like one, stranger.
PatroclusReunionChat15B|Patroclus Reunion Chat 15 B|Patroclus|You've become quite the talk of all Elysium of late.
PatroclusReunionChat15|Patroclus Reunion Chat 15|Patroclus|Our so-called champion isn't as popular around here as he used to be.
PatroclusReunionChat16|Patroclus Reunion Chat 16|Patroclus|I'm grateful for everything you've done.
PatroclusReunionChat17A|Patroclus Reunion Chat 17 A|Patroclus|For all your patience and your kindness.
PatroclusReunionChat17|Patroclus Reunion Chat 17|Patroclus|I want you to have this.
PatroclusGift01|Patroclus Gift 01|Zagreus|Hey, look, I can tell you're struggling right now, and... maybe this isn't the way to help you through it all, but... I want you to have this.
PatroclusGift01|Patroclus Gift 01|Patroclus|*Ahh*, so you are taking pity on me, then? Well, I've no pride like many others here, so I shall take it. Though, let's make it a fair exchange, shall we?
PatroclusGift02|Patroclus Gift 02|Patroclus|Why would you waste a proper vintage on the likes of me? Questions that are better left unanswered, I would guess.
PatroclusGift02|Patroclus Gift 02|Zagreus|If this eases your burden even for a little while, then it's in good hands, as far as I'm concerned.
PatroclusGift03|Patroclus Gift 03|Patroclus|*Ah*, a means to drown my sorrows temporarily. That's good. And rather kind of you, I have to say.
PatroclusGift03|Patroclus Gift 03|Zagreus|It's nothing. Thank you for not trying to slay me where I stand and boast about it, like seemingly everyone else around here.
PatroclusGift04|Patroclus Gift 04|Patroclus|Oh. Here in Elysium you have to win this stuff, so I have rarely had occasion to enjoy it. Thanks.
PatroclusGift04|Patroclus Gift 04|Zagreus|I'd say you earned it more than anybody else I've seen around here, lately. Though I don't make the rules.
PatroclusGift05|Patroclus Gift 05|Patroclus|You owe me neither time nor generosity, and certainly not this. But if you truly have no better use for it...
PatroclusGift05|Patroclus Gift 05|Zagreus|It's not a matter of owe, sir. Please open your mind to the possibility, nay the fact, that there are those who care about your wellbeing.
PatroclusGift06|Patroclus Gift 06|Patroclus|Just the relief from misery that I was looking for. A fleeting feeling, really, but I'll take a fleeting feeling over none.
PatroclusGift06|Patroclus Gift 06|Zagreus|That's both very dejected and very astute of you to say. Take care of yourself, will you?
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Here, sir. The drink of the gods, themselves. Thought maybe you would like to try it! Just a small token of my appreciation for your selflessness with me, time after time.
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Patroclus|You'd give the precious gift of Ambrosia to someone like me, stranger? A gloried thing like that. Why bother...? I should be just another shade to you.
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Zagreus|Well, you're not. You're someone I look forward to seeing here in Elysium, which is more than I can say for just about anybody else around here, so... please, enjoy it. Perhaps with Achilles.
PatroclusGift07_A|Patroclus Gift 07 A|Patroclus|Well... perhaps I'll try. You're not so bad, you know that, stranger? Careful with that, or you'll undermine the ruthless reputation that you have.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|I don't see that last bottle of Ambrosia anywhere, which I can only take to mean... you need another. Here, sir. Thanks for seeing me through all of this, time after time.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Patroclus|You're thanking *me*, stranger? I've been here for some time, I think, and yet... some of your customs I'll admit remain quite strange to me. You've done more for me than I've any right to expect, from anyone.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|It's just a bottle of Ambrosia, sir, it's really no big deal. OK, fine, it's rather difficult to come by, but still!
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Patroclus|You jest, but I do not. I'd offer you my lifelong gratitude, but... well, you know.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Zagreus|You've got the rest of your life ahead of you, as far as I'm concerned. Here's to starting anew, right? You can call me Zagreus, or stranger, whatever suits you.
PatroclusGift08_A|Patroclus Gift 08 A|Patroclus|And... I'm Patroclus, by the way. I'm realizing now... we've not officially met. It's good to know you, Zagreus. Stranger.
PatroclusGift07|Patroclus Gift 07|Patroclus|You're much too kind to such a wretched shade, you know. But I'll not turn away this type of thing.
PatroclusGift07|Patroclus Gift 07|Zagreus|You don't attack me indiscriminately, I give you Nectar. I don't think I'm being over-generous!
PatroclusGift08|Patroclus Gift 08|Patroclus|Forgive my bluntness, but, why go out of your way for me like this...?
PatroclusGift08|Patroclus Gift 08|Zagreus|I'm not going out of my way, sir. Look, I don't pretend to know the depths of your despair. But when I look at you, I'm reminded of how I've often felt. When I was in that dark place, someone said to me: Don't give up. If nothing else... it gives you something to do.
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_A|Eurydice First Meeting 01 A|Eurydice|Hey, you must be the Hades kid! How's it going, then, Your Royal Majesty? Nice to meet you, I'm Eurydice. What brings a big important guy like you up to a place like this?
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_A|Eurydice First Meeting 01 A|Zagreus|Hi there! No need for formalities, I'm Zagreus. Just heading out on some official business! Surveying the magma situation firsthand. Don't mean to be rude, though I'm in a bit of a rush.
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_A|Eurydice First Meeting 01 A|Eurydice|Well don't you have your hands full, hon! I'll let you go, but there's one rule in my place, which is: Nobody leaves here empty-handed, you got that? So take your pick, my treat!
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_B|Eurydice First Meeting 01 B|Eurydice|Hey you must be the Hades kid! How's it going, then, Your Royal Majesty? Nice to meet you, I'm Eurydice. What brings a big important guy like you up to a place like this?
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_B|Eurydice First Meeting 01 B|Zagreus|Hi there! No need for formalities, I'm Zagreus. Just heading out on some official business. Past the menacing Bone Hydra. Don't mean to be rude, though I'm in a bit of a rush.
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_B|Eurydice First Meeting 01 B|Eurydice|Well don't you have your hands full, hon! I'll let you go, but there's one rule in my place, which is: Nobody leaves here empty-handed, you got that? So take your pick, my treat!
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_C|Eurydice First Meeting 01 C|Eurydice|Hey you must be the Hades kid! How's it going, then, Your Royal Majesty? Nice to meet you, I'm Eurydice. What brings a big important guy like you up to a place like this?
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_C|Eurydice First Meeting 01 C|Zagreus|Hi there! No need for formalities, I'm Zagreus. Just heading out on some official business. Say, if your name's Eurydice, I don't suppose you know an Orpheus, do you? Quite musically inclined, a little dour, impressive hair?
EurydiceFirstMeeting01_C|Eurydice First Meeting 01 C|Eurydice|*He *put you up to this? Look, hon, why don't you get on with your business, then. But you can't leave empty-handed, that's the rule, so take your pick, my treat! Nothing for him, though.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01|Eurydice About Orpheus 01|Eurydice|Hey, hon, what's going on, speak up! I know when something's up down to my roots, and something's up.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01|Eurydice About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|Well it's just, I think that you may know an Orpheus, don't you? Quite musically inclined, a little dour, impressive hair? He's court musician in my father's house. Calls you his muse. Says he misses you terribly. I... thought you should know.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01|Eurydice About Orpheus 01|Eurydice|Orpheus said all that, huh? Tell you what, the next time you run into him, you ask him about the time that he came all this way to try and save me, even though I was already dead. Can you guess how that turned out?
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01|Eurydice About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|*Erm*... yes, I do believe I can. Look, I didn't mean to upset you.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01|Eurydice About Orpheus 01|Eurydice|Yeah, well, neither did he! But you know what? Actions beat intentions, hon. Now, here, how about a treat and you can be on your way.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01_B|Eurydice About Orpheus 01 B|Eurydice|Hey, hon, what's going on, speak up! I know when something's up down to my roots, and something's up.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01_B|Eurydice About Orpheus 01 B|Zagreus|Well it's just, I think I wanted to tell you more of Orpheus, since... he's court musician in my father's house. Calls you his muse. Says he misses you terribly. I... thought you should know.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01_B|Eurydice About Orpheus 01 B|Eurydice|Orpheus said all that, huh? Tell you what, the next time you run into him, you ask him about the time that he came all this way to try and save me, even though I was already dead. Can you guess how that turned out?
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01_B|Eurydice About Orpheus 01 B|Zagreus|*Erm*... yes, I do believe I can. Look, I didn't mean to upset you.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus01_B|Eurydice About Orpheus 01 B|Eurydice|Yeah, well, neither did he! But you know what? Actions beat intentions, hon. Now, here, how about a treat and you can be on your way.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus02|Eurydice About Orpheus 02|Eurydice|What is it, hon? Oh no, don't tell me you've come all the way from Tartarus to ask me more about your good-for-nothing court musician friend.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus02|Eurydice About Orpheus 02|Zagreus|Certainly not! I'm merely here for your wonderful singing, cooking, or conversational ability. Though, since you mentioned it, you... seem to have a lot to say to him. Is there anything I can do?
EurydiceAboutOrpheus02|Eurydice About Orpheus 02|Eurydice|So let me see if I understand. Orpheus blew it with me like an idiot, but now I'm supposed to be reaching out to *him*? Sorry, hon, but that's not happening. The two of us are finished. And, you know what? I think we're finished here, too. If you'll excuse me!
EurydiceAboutOrpheus03|Eurydice About Orpheus 03|Eurydice|Hey there, hon! So what do you think, pretty good tune, right? Don't know how come everybody doesn't sing. Lightens the mood, passes the time. What's not to like?
EurydiceAboutOrpheus03|Eurydice About Orpheus 03|Zagreus|It's a beautiful song. Even though you're angry with him... Orpheus, I mean... you're always singing, still?
EurydiceAboutOrpheus03|Eurydice About Orpheus 03|Eurydice|Oh it's not Orpheus' song, you kidding me? This one's all mine. He always did like going on about how I'm his muse, well, that's 'cause I wrote half his songs for him! Bet he didn't mention that, did he.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus03|Eurydice About Orpheus 03|Zagreus|Well, not exactly in those words, but... Orpheus can be a little hard to parse.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus03|Eurydice About Orpheus 03|Eurydice|He can be a little hard to tolerate. A quality I hope isn't going to rub off on any of his mates. I should get back to practicing, see you.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus04|Eurydice About Orpheus 04|Zagreus|Look, Eurydice, I promise not to bother you with this each time, but... you should know your husband's shattered by what happened with the two of you. He's genuinely sorry, and he loves you very deeply, still, I'm sure of it.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus04|Eurydice About Orpheus 04|Eurydice|*Tsk*... and what am I supposed to do with that, Your Royal Majesty...?
EurydiceAboutOrpheus04|Eurydice About Orpheus 04|Zagreus|I... I don't know yet. Though, you know what? You shouldn't take my word for it. You should take his.
EurydiceAboutOrpheus04|Eurydice About Orpheus 04|Eurydice|Don't think I will be running into him anytime soon from what I understand. But you're the Hades kid! You want to pull some strings on our behalf, go right ahead, I guess. But I won't hold my breath. Even if I could.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus01|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (1)|Eurydice|So, *uh*, how's Orpheus been doing lately, anyway? Still keeping his hair in those neat little curls? I guess his tan must have faded by now.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus01|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (1)|Zagreus|Curls? *Erm*, not exactly, no. But he's doing all right! For him. He's started singing again, lately, which was a big step. He never used to, before. Would go on about how he'd lost his muse.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus01|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (1)|Eurydice|And now he knows I'm out there, still, huh. That's... well, thank you for the update, hon. Music's his gift. Good to know he's not thrown everything away.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus02|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (2)|Zagreus|Eurydice, can I ask you for a favor here? Not that you owe me anything, but, would you hear me out?
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus02|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (2)|Eurydice|Yeah, sure, hon, what is it? Though you had better not be asking for my recipes. Closely guarded family secret! I'd say I'd take them to my grave, but... yeah.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus02|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (2)|Zagreus|It's not your recipes, though they are wonderful. It's your song. I'm sure it'd be a hit around the House! And, I know someone who really needs to hear it. Don't suppose you've got a parchment-copy I could have?
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus02|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (2)|Eurydice|Your Royal Majesty, you want my *song*? You are aware it's called *'Good Riddance'*, right? *Tsk*, but sure, why not. If music's going to be playing in your House, it might as well be great. And let me give you something to go with it.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus_SongReaction01|Duo - Progress and Orpheus Song Reaction (1)|Eurydice|...What'd he say, hon? I mean about the song. Bet he loved it, didn't he! But, I don't know for sure. And I've been wondering, kind of a lot, I guess.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus_SongReaction01|Duo - Progress and Orpheus Song Reaction (1)|Zagreus|No need to wonder any longer. He sings it beautifully, around the House sometimes. It... has a sadder sound to it than when you sing, but... you've inspired him again. As you've done many times before, from what I know.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus_SongReaction01|Duo - Progress and Orpheus Song Reaction (1)|Eurydice|Huh. So it's a hit, is what you're saying, then. I had a feeling about that one. Sometimes you put some words together and right then and there, you know that you've got something special.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus03|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (3)|Eurydice|What happens now, hon...? What I mean is... now you got me thinking about Orpheus again, so... what am I supposed to do with that?
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus03|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (3)|Zagreus|Even if you can't be together right now, I hope it feels better knowing how much he cares for you. And I will try to pull some strings, like you said. I can't make promises where my father's concerned, but... I'll do everything I can.
EurydiceProgressWithOrpheus03|Duo - Progress and Orpheus (3)|Eurydice|Well, what can I tell you? Thanks, Your Royal Majesty. That means a lot. No pressure, though. I've been all right without him all this time, and I will be all right, no matter what. If only he could say the same.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Eurydice|Hey, listen here a moment, Hades kid. Look, I... Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. For bringing Orphy back to me again, and everything.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Zagreus|Eurydice, you're more than welcome, really. You've helped me through the flames of hell, time after time. Least I could do is coax old Orpheus out of his private pit of despair so you and he could set things right between the two of you.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete01|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 01|Eurydice|Well, you're a real sweetheart, hon. You'll still be seeing Orphy all the time around your House, but now, I get to see him, too. Nice having something to look forward to, you know? Bet someone out there feels that about you.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete02|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 02|Eurydice|Hey! What's the matter, Your Royal Majesty? You're looking kind of down. Normally you're all smiles, for whatever reason!
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete02|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 02|Zagreus|Oh, I... well, looking back, all this stuff between you and Orpheus, I realized... well, I hope I wasn't too pushy about the whole thing. It wasn't any of my business to pry into your personal life. I should have asked.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete02|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 02|Eurydice|Oh, that? *Pff*, come on, don't even worry about it. If you were being too pushy, you better believe I would have put you back in your place, royalty or not. But hey, can't ever be too careful when it comes to people's past and feelings and stuff, right?
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete03|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03|Eurydice|Got to tell you, hon. Orpheus sure is different since last he and I met. You know, back when he was still living and breathing and all.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete03|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03|Zagreus|I think the experience of trying to rescue you, failing, dying, becoming court musician, refusing to sing, then being locked in solitary confinement, then finding out about you probably did a number on him. Why, is everything all right? You seemed to be getting along last I saw.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete03|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 03|Eurydice|Oh, we're getting along great! Better than ever. He used to be a bit more of a hotshot, but now it's like, he's a little more... what's the word... sensitive? Now I can always tell exactly what's on his mind.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete04|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 04|Eurydice|Hey, Your Royal Majesty! I must say you've accomplished some truly amazing feats, according to Orphy at least! But don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete04|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 04|Zagreus|Oh, no, he's been boasting of my fabricated exploits to you? I've tried to tell him I was only joking with him but now he just thinks I'm being modest.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete04|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 04|Eurydice|That modesty won't get you anywhere with me, either, hon, Your Greatness. I'm honored to merely be in the presence of one with so many wild exploits to sing or speak of!
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete05|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 05|Zagreus|Hey did Orpheus really use to have curls, and... something called a tan? I've only ever seen him looking... well, how he does now.
EurydiceAboutSingersReunionQuestComplete05|Eurydice About Singers Reunion Quest Complete 05|Eurydice|He did! And a tan is like... well, when you stay out in the hot sun up there long enough, your skin kind of starts to bake a little bit. But nicer than that sounds! Got to say, though, the years have been kind to Orphy, don't you think?
EurydiceMentionsOrpheus01|Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01|Eurydice|Say, tell me something, there, Your Royal Majesty. You know a lot of shades. You wouldn't happen to know an Orpheus, would you? Spindly little thing, whiny voice? Heard he's officially serving in your court. Making music!
EurydiceMentionsOrpheus01|Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01|Zagreus|Of course I know Orpheus, we're mates! Wait, why do you ask?
EurydiceMentionsOrpheus01|Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01|Eurydice|You're mates, huh. Just as long as you don't count on him for anything. Hasn't even mentioned me, has he. Well if he ever does, you tell him I am doing great! I'm great.
EurydiceMentionsOrpheus01_B|Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01 B|Eurydice|What's the latest, hon, anything been happening down in your fancy House lately?
EurydiceMentionsOrpheus01_B|Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01 B|Zagreus|Well, you mentioned Orpheus... my father had him locked up for a little while for refusing to sing. Being court musician and all. But he's out now, and doing OK! I think.
EurydiceMentionsOrpheus01_B|Eurydice Mentions Orpheus 01 B|Eurydice|Not following instructions, huh. Sounds like Orpheus, all right. Well, if that's the most exciting thing you've got going on, then I haven't missed much being out here.
EurydiceAboutHermes01|Eurydice About Hermes 01|Eurydice|Hey, what's up, hon? Say, you must know a lot of big shots, don't you? Other gods and all that?
EurydiceAboutHermes01|Eurydice About Hermes 01|Zagreus|I know a few. As a matter of fact, I heard recently from Hermes, wanted you to know he felt sorry for how things ended up. That something to do with when Orpheus went in here after you?
EurydiceAboutHermes01|Eurydice About Hermes 01|Eurydice|Oh, that's sweet of him! Nice enough guy, for an Olympian. Yeah, he was the one who dropped me off here in the first place. No hard feelings here, he was just doing his job. It was Orpheus who messed everything up.
EurydiceAboutNymphs01|Eurydice About Nymphs 01|Eurydice|Sure don't see a lot of other nymphs around here, huh! We don't die too easy, most of us. Makes me feel all special!
EurydiceAboutNymphs01|Eurydice About Nymphs 01|Zagreus|I've never met another nymph, now that you mention it. Heard of a few! The goddess Artemis, sounds like she spends more time with nymphs than the other Olympians.
EurydiceAboutNymphs01|Eurydice About Nymphs 01|Eurydice|That's what I heard! Though it's not like we all hang out, I mean, you've got the dryads, and the naiads, and the nereids, and the oceanids... pretty much every type of terrain up top, there's a kind of nymph who loves it! Maybe we need a name for Underworld nymphs, too.
EurydiceAboutPersephone01|Eurydice About Persephone 01|Zagreus|Eurydice, did you by any chance ever meet a *Persephone *during the whole thing when Orpheus came down to try to get you?
EurydiceAboutPersephone01|Eurydice About Persephone 01|Eurydice|Oh, her? Yeah, she was with Hades Senior, why? Wait. *Whoa*. Are you...? I thought...
EurydiceAboutPersephone01|Eurydice About Persephone 01|Zagreus|It's complicated. And, please keep it quiet. I was just wondering... what was she like? If you recall.
EurydiceAboutPersephone01|Eurydice About Persephone 01|Eurydice|Didn't get much of an impression, but I can tell you this: She had good taste in music! Orpheus and I, think we won her over with our little duet. Haven't seen or heard from her lately, though. Look, I hope everything's OK.
EurydiceAboutPersephone01_B|Eurydice About Persephone 01 B|Zagreus|Eurydice, did you by any chance ever meet a *Persephone *during the whole thing when Orpheus came down to try to get you?
EurydiceAboutPersephone01_B|Eurydice About Persephone 01 B|Eurydice|Oh, her? Yeah, she was with Hades Senior, why? Wait. *Whoa*. Are you...? I thought...
EurydiceAboutPersephone01_B|Eurydice About Persephone 01 B|Zagreus|It's complicated. And, please keep it quiet. I was just wondering... what was she like? If you recall.
EurydiceAboutPersephone01_B|Eurydice About Persephone 01 B|Eurydice|Didn't get much of an impression, but I can tell you this: She had good taste in music! Orpheus and I, think we won her over with our little duet. Haven't seen or heard from her lately, though.
EurydicePostEpilogue01|Eurydice Post Epilogue 01|Eurydice|Hey, everybody's saying Persephone... she's back? That sounds like a bit of good news, there, isn't that right, hon?
EurydicePostEpilogue01|Eurydice Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Hey, she is back, and yes, it is good news, thank you. She and I have a lot of making up for lost time left to do, though I think we're off to a pretty decent start.
EurydicePostEpilogue01|Eurydice Post Epilogue 01|Eurydice|Well, that's a relief. And, you're still here! So I guess you've got more official business to take care of, which means I've still got somebody to taste-test for me every now and then!
EurydicePostEpilogue02|Eurydice Post Epilogue 02|Eurydice|Orphy tells me the Queen, she's been settling in just fine down at your House! Must be different having a lady like that around. How's Hades Senior taking it, if I may ask?
EurydicePostEpilogue02|Eurydice Post Epilogue 02|Zagreus|Oh, he's taking it... about as well as he's taken anything ever, now that you mention it. Still very much himself, mind you, but still... it's been a welcome change.
EurydicePostEpilogue02|Eurydice Post Epilogue 02|Eurydice|Glad to hear it! Orphy always liked singing for an audience more than I did, and it sounds like she's a good one.
EurydiceAboutMusic01|Eurydice About Music 01|Eurydice|You ever play any music, or sing or anything yourself, Hades kid? It's good for you, you know!
EurydiceAboutMusic01|Eurydice About Music 01|Zagreus|I play a bit of the lyre, as a matter of fact! Orpheus himself gave me some pointers on it. Never really tried singing, though. I can't even imagine it, really.
EurydiceAboutMusic01|Eurydice About Music 01|Eurydice|Well, might I recommend giving it a shot at some point? Who knows, you might be the next Orpheus!
EurydiceAboutOnions01|Eurydice About Onions 01|Eurydice|You been snacking on *onions *or something, there, hon? No offense or anything, but you smell like you ate a whole one of them raw.
EurydiceAboutOnions01|Eurydice About Onions 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, yes, but... wait. How else are you supposed to eat those things?
EurydiceAboutOnions01|Eurydice About Onions 01|Eurydice|What, are you kidding me? You can grill them, sauté them, fry them, boil them, pickle them, roast them! Oh, hon. You've been missing out.
EurydiceAboutLove01|Eurydice About Love 01|Eurydice|You got anyone special in your life, by the way, hon? You seem like you'd be good for somebody out here.
EurydiceAboutLove01|Eurydice About Love 01|Zagreus|You know what, yes, I do, Eurydice. Things have moved so fast for me lately I barely stopped to think about it, though. It helps not having to go through everything alone... just knowing I'll see them again soon.
EurydiceAboutLove01|Eurydice About Love 01|Eurydice|Know what you mean. And hey, that's great! Long as you can still be yourself. I've known too many nymphs, their whole lives revolved around somebody they loved. I bet whoever it is that loves you... it's because of who you are.
EurydiceMiscMeeting01|Eurydice Misc Meeting 01|Zagreus|Eurydice, how long have you been down here, anyway, if you don't mind my asking? Seems like you're pretty settled in. It's quite a lovely place!
EurydiceMiscMeeting01|Eurydice Misc Meeting 01|Eurydice|How long have I been down here, hon? *Huh*! I don't have the faintest. You lose your sense of time once you're a shade, or maybe once there's not a sun or moon over your head. But yeah, I found myself a decent spot and fixed it up a bit!
EurydiceMiscMeeting02|Eurydice Misc Meeting 02|Eurydice|You're just in time, Your Royal Majesty! Got something real good cooking right here that you are going to love. You hungry, yeah?
EurydiceMiscMeeting02|Eurydice Misc Meeting 02|Zagreus|Am I ever. You're always so generous. And you're always cooking! And singing. Do you have many guests come by? Your place seems... somewhat off the beaten path.
EurydiceMiscMeeting02|Eurydice Misc Meeting 02|Eurydice|What, you think I get a lot of guests, here? *Haha*, no, but I like cooking anyway! It's like singing, in a way. Keep getting better the more you try, turns out a bit different each time.
EurydiceMiscMeeting03|Eurydice Misc Meeting 03|Zagreus|Eurydice, how can you cook so much with all the searing heat around these parts? Has it been magma-flooded like this all the time?
EurydiceMiscMeeting03|Eurydice Misc Meeting 03|Eurydice|The searing heat? *Haha*, I am dead, Your Royal Majesty! Searing's just a cooking technique to me. Don't need to sleep, either! I can just keep cooking up a storm. It's not so bad!
EurydiceMiscMeeting04|Eurydice Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|You know, I've never met a nymph before. You're closer to the gods than mortals, right?
EurydiceMiscMeeting04|Eurydice Misc Meeting 04|Eurydice|Yeah, gods that can *die*! How is that fair? Was just a stupid snake bite in my case, can you imagine something more embarrassing? You're just minding your business, and then *snap*! You're dead, and on your way down here.
EurydiceMiscMeeting04|Eurydice Misc Meeting 04|Zagreus|I... know the feeling better than you might expect.
EurydiceMiscMeeting04|Eurydice Misc Meeting 04|Eurydice|Well, I was going to end up here sooner or later. Might as well while I'm still looking good. Though, I guess you do kind of get to lock in whatever age when you register. Bet everybody dying of old age pushed that one through.
EurydiceMiscMeeting05|Eurydice Misc Meeting 05|Eurydice|What's your official business, anyway, Your Royal Majesty? Seems like it's bringing you through Asphodel an awful lot lately.
EurydiceMiscMeeting05|Eurydice Misc Meeting 05|Zagreus|It's... look, the truth is, I am trying to get out of here. I've hit some stumbling blocks along the way, but, I think I will make it there, eventually.
EurydiceMiscMeeting05|Eurydice Misc Meeting 05|Eurydice|Oh really! Say no more, I know how that is. Hope the Fates will look the other way for you. Getting out of here, huh. Not thought of that myself in I don't know how long...
EurydiceMiscMeeting06|Eurydice Misc Meeting 06|Eurydice|Of all the lava rocks in Asphodel, the Hades kid found this one once again, wouldn't you know! You got a map or something to this place, or what?
EurydiceMiscMeeting06|Eurydice Misc Meeting 06|Zagreus|Don't know that a map would help me much since things keep shifting out here every single time. Though it is an interesting coincidence how I keep running into you.
EurydiceMiscMeeting06|Eurydice Misc Meeting 06|Eurydice|Coincidence? Come on, hon, you're a god. Someone out there is sending you my way. Maybe it's just the Fates. Ah well! I sure don't mind a little company. And I have lots to eat!
EurydiceAboutAcorn01|Eurydice About Acorn 01|Zagreus|Eurydice, wanted to thank you once again for this enchanted acorn that you gave me. So this is what plants and things grow from, up on the surface?
EurydiceAboutAcorn01|Eurydice About Acorn 01|Eurydice|Oh, not just any plants, hon! Trees! Big gnarled oaks and things. Some of them live hundreds of years! Way up there as mortals go. You take good care of it like that, maybe it'll grow to be something special for you, too!
EurydiceAboutAcorn02|Eurydice About Acorn 02|Zagreus|Hey, this is sort of a weird question, but... this Evergreen Acorn, it's not... related to you, is it? Since, you know, you're... partly oak, aren't you?
EurydiceAboutAcorn02|Eurydice About Acorn 02|Eurydice|Yeah, I'm part oak, that's right. But maybe not the part you're thinking of, I mean, you think I would just hand you one of my babies or something? *Hahahaha*, that's disgusting!
EurydiceAboutDistantMemory01|Eurydice About Distant Memory 01|Eurydice|Hold on, hon, is that... *huh*! Almost felt like Orpheus was with you there. Would you listen to me? Must have been singing too many high notes, or something.
EurydiceAboutDistantMemory01|Eurydice About Distant Memory 01|Zagreus|No, wait, you're onto something... I think you must have sensed Orpheus' Distant Memory! He gave it to me as a keepsake of our friendship. Though, something like this... I feel like it should belong to you.
EurydiceAboutDistantMemory01|Eurydice About Distant Memory 01|Eurydice|Oh, that's him in there all right! See, I never should have second-guessed myself. Well, you hang onto that, as I've got plenty memories of him already, thanks!
EurydiceLowHealth01|Eurydice Low Health 01|Eurydice|Oh, hon, you look awful. What did you get yourself into? Here, one of these should make you feel a little better.
EurydiceLowHealth02|Eurydice Low Health 02|Eurydice|Oh, you look like you've been through a lot, Hades kid. Maybe a decent bite to eat will help!
EurydiceLowHealth03|Eurydice Low Health 03|Eurydice|*Oof*, you're a mess, there, hon. You save your strength and see if this will do you any good.
EurydiceLowHealth04|Eurydice Low Health 04|Eurydice|Hey, don't go bleeding on my floor, hon. I just cleaned the place! Take one of these, maybe it'll tide you over.
EurydiceChat01|Eurydice Chat 01|Eurydice|Why not have a quick bite of something to eat before you head on out, hon?
EurydiceChat02|Eurydice Chat 02|Eurydice|Sing when you're happy, sing when you're not, Your Royal Majesty.
EurydiceChat03|Eurydice Chat 03|Eurydice|Hey, it's the Hades kid! So what's it going to be this time, Your Royal Majesty?
EurydiceChat04|Eurydice Chat 04|Eurydice|I'd say make yourself at home, hon, but you look like you got cooler places to be!
EurydiceChat05|Eurydice Chat 05|Eurydice|You are just in time, Your Royal Majesty! Cooked up something special just for you.
EurydiceChat06|Eurydice Chat 06|Eurydice|Why, Your Royal Majesty, you're back! Well, see you later!
EurydiceChat07|Eurydice Chat 07|Eurydice|And here I was just thinking it's been too long since the Hades kid stopped by!
EurydiceChat08|Eurydice Chat 08|Eurydice|So what'll it be this time, Your Royal Majesty, hmm?
EurydiceChat09|Eurydice Chat 09|Eurydice|Oh you look positively famished, hon! Here let me help with that.
EurydiceChat11|Eurydice Chat 11|Eurydice|You must be hungry, hon. Got something ought to keep you going!
EurydiceChat12|Eurydice Chat 12|Eurydice|How nice of you to stop on by, Your Royal Highness! Here!
EurydiceChat13|Eurydice Chat 13|Eurydice|How's it going lately, hon, you eating well and everything?
EurydiceChat14|Eurydice Chat 14|Eurydice|Just singing to myself and cooking up a storm. You know me, hon.
EurydiceChat15|Eurydice Chat 15|Eurydice|Eat up, hon! Not like I got other mouths to feed!
EurydiceChatExtra01|Eurydice Chat Extra 01|Eurydice|All's well in Asphodel, Your Royal Majesty! You take care of yourself. I'll be here.
EurydiceChatExtra02|Eurydice Chat Extra 02|Eurydice|You want the best cooking in all of Asphodel, you know where to go!
EurydiceChatExtra03|Eurydice Chat Extra 03|Eurydice|Hey, it's the Hades kid! What's it going to be this time, hm?
EurydiceChatExtra04|Eurydice Chat Extra 04|Eurydice|Take care of yourself out there, all right, Your Royal Majesty?
EurydiceChatExtra05|Eurydice Chat Extra 05|Eurydice|Don't let Hades Senior get you down, hon. Here.
EurydiceChatExtra06|Eurydice Chat Extra 06|Eurydice|I know you've got important business to attend to, so thanks for checking in, Your Royal Majesty.
EurydiceChatExtra07|Eurydice Chat Extra 07|Eurydice|You look like you're in a rush, though there's always time for a quick snack, right?
EurydiceChatExtra08|Eurydice Chat Extra 08|Eurydice|Hey, welcome back, Your Royal Majesty, you're just in time!
EurydiceChatExtra09|Eurydice Chat Extra 09|Eurydice|Been trying to perfect these recipes for I don't know how long!
EurydiceChatExtra10|Eurydice Chat Extra 10|Eurydice|You look like you haven't eaten since you were here last!
EurydiceChatExtra11|Eurydice Chat Extra 11|Eurydice|You're always welcome here Your Royal Majesty.
EurydiceChatExtra12|Eurydice Chat Extra 12|Eurydice|I get you something for the road there, hon?
EurydiceChatExtra13|Eurydice Chat Extra 13|Eurydice|What's it going to be, Your Royal Majesty?
EurydiceMadChat01|Eurydice Mad Chat 01|Eurydice|You just be sure to tell that good-for-nothing Orpheus I'm looking good.
EurydiceMadChat02|Eurydice Mad Chat 02|Eurydice|Hon, I'd ask how old what's-his-name is doing, but I don't even care!
EurydiceMadChat03|Eurydice Mad Chat 03|Eurydice|Bet you Orpheus hasn't had any strokes of musical genius lately, now, has he?
EurydiceMadChat05|Eurydice Mad Chat 05|Eurydice|Better not be Orpheus putting you up to visiting here all the time like this.
EurydiceMadChat06|Eurydice Mad Chat 06|Eurydice|This song's better than anything Orpheus ever came up with I can tell you that.
EurydiceMadChat07|Eurydice Mad Chat 07|Eurydice|If you'll excuse me, Your Royal Majesty, I'm not exactly in the mood for an extended chat.
EurydiceMadChat09|Eurydice Mad Chat 09|Eurydice|You best have no more messages from no-good Orpheus this time.
EurydiceMadChat10|Eurydice Mad Chat 10|Eurydice|Here, have a snack, hon, and tell Orpheus it was delicious.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat01|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 01|Eurydice|You keep an eye on Orpheus for me, all right, hon?
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat02|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 02|Eurydice|Do one thing for me, hon. Make sure Orpheus knows I'll be right here.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat03|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 03|Eurydice|I've got to be honest with you, hon. Sometimes I kind of miss him.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat04|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 04|Eurydice|Sometime you'll visit me like this and Orpheus is going to be here too.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat05|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 05|Eurydice|Don't let Orpheus get into too much trouble, won't you, hon?
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat06|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 06|Eurydice|I'm fine here on my own, hon. But, I wouldn't mind if he was here.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat07|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 07|Eurydice|Hope Orpheus is on the up-and-up down where you live.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat08|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 08|Eurydice|I'd ask you to bring one of these to Orpheus, but they're no good unless they're perfectly fresh.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat09|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 09|Eurydice|Orpheus tells me you've been a good friend. Thanks, hon.
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat10|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 10|Eurydice|I love Orpheus and all, hon, but it's nice having a little time here to myself!
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat10|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 10|Eurydice|I know you can't stay long, hon, so eat up and stay safe out there, all right?
EurydiceAintEvenMadChat11|Eurydice Aint Even Mad Chat 11|Eurydice|I sing when Orpheus is here, I sing when he isn't. Simple!
EurydiceGift01|Eurydice Gift 01|Zagreus|Eurydice, thank you for making me feel welcome in your pleasant home. Can't say the same for most places I've been lately. I've a small gift I wanted you to have.
EurydiceGift01|Eurydice Gift 01|Eurydice|*Aw*, that's awful sweet of you, Your Royal Majesty. Bringing me fresh ingredients like this! Know what, here's something for you, too, help keep you safe out there!
EurydiceGift02|Eurydice Gift 02|Eurydice|Just the ingredient I needed, hon, thank you so much! You know, you aren't near as bad as I'd heard!
EurydiceGift02|Eurydice Gift 02|Zagreus|Oh, don't worry, we're still getting to know each other! Plenty of time for me to live up to my notorious reputation. Though I'm surprised you've heard of me at all.
EurydiceGift03|Eurydice Gift 03|Eurydice|*Aw*, for me, really, Your Majesty? This will be perfect for my latest recipes.
EurydiceGift03|Eurydice Gift 03|Zagreus|You know, of all the souls I've ever met, I feel like you put this stuff to the best possible use.
EurydiceGift04|Eurydice Gift 04|Eurydice|You read my mind, hon! I go through this stuff awful fast sometimes.
EurydiceGift04|Eurydice Gift 04|Zagreus|And I, in turn, shall go through your incredible cooking awful fast, given the opportunity.
EurydiceGift05|Eurydice Gift 05|Eurydice|Hey, mighty generous of you to keep me stocked up on this stuff, Your Royal Majesty!
EurydiceGift05|Eurydice Gift 05|Zagreus|My pleasure! I'm always pleased to see you during my otherwise generally unfortunate travels in Asphodel.
EurydiceGift06|Eurydice Gift 06|Eurydice|Thanks, Your Majesty! Though you're not going to get in trouble bringing me this stuff, are you?
EurydiceGift06|Eurydice Gift 06|Zagreus|*Hah*, no! I don't think I can get into more trouble at the moment. May this make your dishes that much more delectable!
EurydiceGift07|Eurydice Gift 07|Zagreus|Eurydice, I was thinking maybe this would benefit your culinary practice. Here, please.
EurydiceGift07|Eurydice Gift 07|Eurydice|Whoa, this is Ambrosia! Hard to come by this stuff around here. You sure I can have this?
EurydiceGift07|Eurydice Gift 07|Zagreus|Absolutely! Least I could do for all your friendship and support. Always happy to hear your voice when I'm out here.
EurydiceGift08|Eurydice Gift 08|Eurydice|I ever tell you you're a real sweetheart, hon? Because, if not, I'm telling you right now. Where would my culinary practice be if not for you?
EurydiceGift08|Eurydice Gift 08|Zagreus|I think your culinary practice would be every bit as extraordinary, though I'm pleased to have done small service to you in this great pursuit.
EurydiceGift08|Eurydice Gift 08|Eurydice|Well, we both know you've done a lot more for me than that. I wasn't expecting to make any new friends here anytime soon, so all the more reason it's been a real treat to get to know you. If I may say? You're a hell of a guy, Your Royal Majesty.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|Pray, who might you be, wandering all the way out here? You're trespassing on private property, you know. Speak up!
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|*Erm*, you must be... Persephone. My name is Zagreus, and... I think I might be your son.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|*What*?! How dare...! Get out of here! Get out, or I shall make you!! *Out *with you!
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|No!! So then you *are *her. I, I don't care if you hate me, but I'm not leaving until I get some answers! I never even knew you existed. Why did you leave me?
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|You died! You, you *died*...! Those burning feet, they... sputtered out, when you were born. But... now you're standing here before me. How...?
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|I died? I died... what, you mean *permanently *died, but, I'm alive! Oh, gods... you never even knew I existed, either.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|Alive! Zagreus, he... even kept your name! You live, how can this be, you live? *You live*...! Oh, the cruel Fates! My son!
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|...In short, I beat him, finally, though he did everything he could to prevent our meeting here like this. But there's something he wanted me to tell you, in the end. He said to tell you Cerberus is doing very well.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|*Ah*. He told you that, did he. That's good. That's good! Though, tell me something, Zagreus. How... is it that you found me? To have journeyed all this way, I scarce believe it.... Zagreus?
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|*Ugh*... Oh, it's... guess I'm just a little tired, that's all. Not accustomed to the weather, as I think you call it.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|No... no, that isn't it, it's that... you cannot stay here. You can't stay here.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|Really, you're... *heh*... kicking me out? Why?
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|The Fates are cruel, Zagreus. You're bound to that place... same as your father. So they would have us say good-bye, for now. My heart soars, knowing you live. Then it breaks, that our time together was so brief.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|No... I can... come back... I can come back, now that I found you, he... maybe he'll just let me come back.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|You tell him I demand it. And I demand he also tell me how come he, or for that matter Nyx, never sent notice that you lived! Olympus is all rife with schemers, but I was so naive to think that they were different.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Zagreus|I'll tell him... I'll tell him, I... feel awful. I... I have to go.
PersephoneFirstMeeting|Persephone First Meeting|Persephone|The Styx shall take you, then. Oh, Zagreus. Farewell, my son. Won't you come back to me? When you are able, please. Come back. I shall be waiting here. However long it takes.
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Persephone|I begged the Fates that you'd return to me. Perhaps I ought to be more careful how I speak of them. Tell me, how was your journey? What happened?
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Father didn't make it any easier for me. Nor would he tell me why he never sent for you, after you left. So, I don't know, what's going on, still, but... I wanted to see you, again.
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Persephone|I wanted to see you, too. Come, speak quickly with me, that our time together here may be as full as possible, all right?
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|I just... I need to know what happened, between you and Father. Why are you here, and not with us?
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Persephone|I couldn't live with myself anymore, down there. After I left Olympus, a long story in itself, I came to be with your father, in the Underworld. It was a shock, to say the least. The others in your father's house were welcoming enough, but... I never felt that I belonged.
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|I know the feeling, I think. But you stayed. Long enough to have me. Those whom I've spoken to about you, it's as you said, they have fond memories of you. And then, you even had a child. Did Father... did he mistreat you?
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Persephone|No, no. Your father could be very difficult. Though, he was gentle, with me. Soon enough, we got on fine, better than fine, at times, but... when I was with child... why, I struggled terribly. Because... a child born of surface-dwellers could not live, down there.
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|Could not live down there, according to whom, exactly? The Fates?
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Persephone|According to them, yes. According to your father, and to Nyx. Even having heard... I took my chances, anyway. But when you emerged stillborn... it was too much. I fled. I fled, and came to reside here. Above the notice of the Underworld. Beneath the notice of Olympus.
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|*Urgh*... but... why would Father lie to you? If he never wanted you... or never wanted me... surely he had the means.
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Persephone|I don't know. I'm wondering the same. But, oh, look at you, Zagreus! We're running out of time. It's happening again! Stay with me, please?
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Zagreus|...I'm trying... but I can't... stay that much longer... I don't think.
PersephoneMeeting02|Persephone Meeting 02|Persephone|Oh, my dear son! Then please... ask Hades what you asked of me! Why he would lie? Tell him I must know, the same as you. And you farewell. Until we meet again!
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|Mother, I... discovered how come Father led you to believe that I could not survive past birth. He didn't lie to you, exactly. So he says.
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Persephone|Wait, slow down, Zagreus, what do you mean? He told me you would not survive your birth, yet here you are. How wasn't that a lie?
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|Because... he thought it was the truth. The Fates appointed him dominion over the entire Underworld. But he would never have an heir, so he was led to understand. He never expected me to be born, much less survive.
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Persephone|He never expected you to survive? Then, forgive my asking, but... why did you? *How *did you? The Fates are not known for making mistakes when it comes to such things.
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|Nyx saved my life. Or gave me life, I guess. Then raised me in your absence. The Fates are her daughters, right? Maybe she persuaded them to go easier on me. She cannot say more. In any case, apparently it took her quite a while to revive me, and... by then, you were gone.
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Persephone|Nyx... of course she was involved. I only managed to escape because of her. Then, she restored my stillborn son to life, and nurtured him? And, I never would have known, unless that child, fully grown and having learned the truth, defied his father, and then found me here?
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|Yes. Although, we still don't know how come Father and Nyx never sent for you. Though, *ungh*, let me ask you something, Mother, if you please. If you had found out... that I was born, and very much alive... would you have come back?
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Persephone|Would I have come back... to see my only child? Had I but known you lived... I would have gladly gone through hell again to see you, Zagreus. Of course I would have.
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Zagreus|Well then... what if... *urgh*... what if Father... didn't want you... doing that?
PersephoneMeeting03|Persephone Meeting 03|Persephone|What if he didn't want me coming back to him? Or seeing you? Oh no, you're fading again, Zagreus. You've pushed yourself too hard! But what is it you meant, by what you said?
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Persephone|So good to see you, again, Zagreus. Since last you left, I couldn't help but think the worst, about what happened after I had left... or soon before. You mentioned Nyx... you don't suppose that she and Hades... wanted me out of the way?
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Zagreus|I just... don't think that can be. Though, let me ask you. How long did you know Father? And Nyx, for that matter? Did they seem trustworthy?
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Persephone|Yes. I knew them long enough to have decided yes, that they were trustworthy. As much as anyone I've ever met. But I also know never to be trusting to a fault. I have to consider the possibility I was deceived.
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Zagreus|Especially since neither of them is being forthcoming with me even now, right? And yet, I have this feeling something else is going on, Mother. The way that Father speaks of you, the way Nyx speaks of you... I think... they care for you.
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Persephone|*Ah, hahaha*! Well, they have a funny way of showing it, I think. Your father, so... you have to get through *him *each time you visit *me*?
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Zagreus|I do. Mother, what if... what if Father thinks that he's protecting you? Have you... considered that?
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Persephone|Protecting me? Why Zagreus, what do you mean by that? As you can see, I can fend for myself.
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Zagreus|Well... *urgh*... you're from Olympus, aren't you? But... the gods, none of them seem to know... you're here... so...
PersephoneMeeting04|Persephone Meeting 04|Persephone|What, how would you know something like that? Zagreus? Ah, curse the Fates, you're leaving me again...
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Persephone|Son, I have to ask you, how much do you know about your relatives upon Olympus?
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Zagreus|I think I know quite a bit by now. I've been in steady contact with Athena, Zeus, and other members of the family ever since I first left Father's House... they've been assisting me in getting here.
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Persephone|No... Zagreus, what have you done? You've led them *here*?
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Zagreus|No, no, they think... they think I'm trying to escape from Father so that I can join them on their mountaintop. At least I *think *that's what they think. Most of them, anyway.
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Persephone|But then... does Hades know of this? That Olympus is involved?
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Zagreus|He does. Both he and Nyx. In fact, it's Nyx who put me and Olympus into contact. I could never have broken free of the Underworld if not for their help.
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Persephone|So Nyx and Hades are against each other, then. And Olympus is helping you... but they don't know I'm here, as far as you're aware?
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Zagreus|That's right. More or less. Nyx and Father seem to put up with each other. Don't seem to have much of a choice. Though, ever since I learned of you, Nyx has been helping me to find you... while Father's tried to stop me.
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Persephone|That fool... what was he thinking? What *is *he thinking...? Do you suppose... he thinks that he's protecting me from *them*? Oh, no...
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Zagreus|I... *urgh*... I think maybe he does think so, indeed... because, now having met my relatives upon Olympus, I... can definitely see that they can be a bit... vindictive about things.
PersephoneMeeting05_A|Persephone Meeting 05 A|Persephone|Vindictiveness runs in the family, my son. Then, if Olympus is involved, that would explain a lot. I'm here, not there with them, as you can see. But, oh, it seems we'll have to speak some more, when next you return...
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Persephone|Son, I have to ask you, how much do you know about your relatives upon Olympus?
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Zagreus|A little. I've been in contact with Athena, Zeus, and other members of the family ever since I first left Father's House... they've been assisting me in getting here.
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Persephone|No... Zagreus, what have you done? You've led them *here*?
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Zagreus|No, no, they think... they think I'm trying to escape from Father so that I can join them on their mountaintop. At least I *think *that's what they think. Most of them, anyway.
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Persephone|But then... does Hades know of this? That Olympus is involved?
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Zagreus|He does. Both he and Nyx. In fact, it's Nyx who put me and Olympus into contact. I could never have broken free of the Underworld if not for their help.
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Persephone|So Nyx and Hades are against each other, then. And Olympus is helping you... but they don't know I'm here, as far as you're aware?
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Zagreus|That's right. More or less. Nyx and Father seem to put up with each other. Don't seem to have much of a choice. Though, ever since I learned of you, Nyx has been helping me to find you... while Father's tried to stop me.
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Persephone|That fool... what was he thinking? What *is *he thinking...? Do you suppose... he thinks that he's protecting me from *them*? Oh, no...
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Zagreus|I... *urgh*... I think maybe he does think so, indeed... because, now having met my relatives upon Olympus, I... can definitely see that they can be a bit... vindictive about things.
PersephoneMeeting05_B|Persephone Meeting 05 B|Persephone|Vindictiveness runs in the family, my son. Then, if Olympus is involved, that would explain a lot. I'm here, not there with them, as you can see. But, oh, it seems we'll have to speak some more, when next you return...
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Persephone|I could not stand it on Olympus, Zagreus. The blustering, the posturing... my overbearing mother... none of it. I would have left the mountain voluntarily, except...
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Zagreus|...Except Father absconded with you, didn't he? Dragged you down with him into the Underworld. So if Olympus were to find that out... I shudder to think of the consequences.
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Persephone|That fool is trying to protect me even now. It wasn't he who absconded with me, my son. And it's more complicated even than that. I was content to leave. Willing to make my life within the Underworld. With your father.
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Zagreus|I dare not ask who *did *bring you to Father, then. So, essentially, you ran away from home, to live with *him*? I mean no disrespect, but... did you realize what you were getting yourself into?
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Persephone|We have a tendency to be impetuous when we are younger, Zagreus. I'd heard all about your father before we met. Admired paintings of him. It was very awkward, at first. But he had a bluntness I fancied. A sense of principle. I much preferred him to his brothers, I can tell you that.
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Zagreus|So, *urgh*... then you secretly left Mount Olympus to be with the god of the dead in the Underworld. And Olympus never found out. What do you suppose would happen... if they did?
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Persephone|...I think... there would be war between Olympus and your father, Zagreus, if they found out. Especially now. After all this. And after all this time. They slew their parents once. If the Titans could be wiped from this world, so can we all.
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Zagreus|So it makes sense... if Father, he agrees with you, and thinks... that leaving you in hiding here, that it's the only way... he can prevent that war...
PersephoneMeeting06|Persephone Meeting 06|Persephone|I can see how your father, shrewd but also single-minded as he was, might have followed such a line of reasoning as that. Oh, Zagreus... what have I done?
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Persephone|Zagreus... it's wonderful to see you, but... I need to ask something of you. That you not visit me again, here in this place. Both for your safety, and for mine.
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Zagreus|Wait, what? Because of what would happen if the Olympians found out? So, after everything, you're taking *Father*'s side in all of this?!
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Persephone|I am. Your father is no fool when it comes to matters such as this. Besides... all that has happened... it's my fault. I was selfish! And now both sides of our family threaten to be torn apart.
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Zagreus|Your fault? So let's say you never left Olympus! Then it'd be just like you thought, until quite recently, I think. That I'd never existed! Besides, they haven't found out any of this. What makes you so sure they will, all the sudden?
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Persephone|Nyx may be veiling you from them as she veiled me when I fled here myself. But even her own powers aren't infallible. Each time you visit me, you are incurring risk. One small slip, and they shall find me. Discover your deception. Go home, Zagreus. Please.
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Zagreus|Go home *with *me, Mother! You came here under false pretenses. I haven't fought all this way, over and over again, only to turn back now. I need you in my life! How can you just... turn me away like this?
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Persephone|Oh, Zagreus... I cannot return. After all that happened between Hades and me, and everyone, I just cannot fathom the idea. Besides... the risks we're taking would be even greater if Olympus were to find me there, with him. And you.
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Zagreus|Then... *ungh*... you're just... going to stay here? Alone, in the middle of nowhere, in this little garden... forever? After we part ways, just like that?
PersephoneMeeting07|Persephone Meeting 07|Persephone|My son... I know you've made hard choices and sacrifices to be here with me. And I'm forever grateful to have finally met you. But this is my home, now, yes. While your home is below. Please, if not for your sake, then for mine... do not return. I love you, Zagreus. Good-bye.
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Zagreus|You can't do this to me, Mother. You said Father is no fool, and neither are you. There has to be a way to fix this. Not just with you and Father, but with everyone. There has to be a way!
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Persephone|...You have your father's stubbornness. Listen to me. You're endangering everything you care about by coming here. Don't you understand? Besides...
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Zagreus|What? Besides what? Tell me, please.
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Persephone|...The truth is that I like it here, Zagreus. I have done well for myself on my own. And your father, he has his domain to look after. The feelings he once had for me... feelings we shared... they fade, with time. You'll understand, someday.
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Zagreus|*No*! I won't be understanding anything of the sort. Father still loves you. I'm sure of it! And, he owes you an apology, damn it! I cannot make amends with you on his behalf. It's something only you can do together.
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Persephone|What do you mean he still loves me, Zagreus...? How would you know?
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Zagreus|Because... *ungh*... I'm his blasted son, that's how I know! But *trust me *isn't ever good enough, I know that, too. I'll prove it to you, Mother! Just you wait and see.
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Persephone|You're fading, Son... you don't need to prove anything to me. Please don't do anything rash. All of us made our choices. Now we have to live with them. Isn't it enough, to know that I am safe? That I'm content to be alone?
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Zagreus|No... *urgh*... it's not... it's not enough, for me, because... this blasted family... it cannot just keep hiding from its problems! Running from them! We're stuck with one another, we... we have to do everything we can... for one another!
PersephoneMeeting08|Persephone Meeting 08|Persephone|I... oh, my dear boy...
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Persephone|...Of everything down in that gloomy House, I miss old Cerberus the most, I think. But, I miss other things as well. The lack of light was gentler on my skin. Not being as cold. And Nyx, and her young sons. It was all very odd, but...
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Zagreus|Mother... in Father's bedchambers... mind you, there's almost nothing there, just neatly sorted rows of all his samey capes... but on his nightstand... is a portrait of *you*. Wearing a regal crown of red laurels. A Queen. *His *Queen.
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Persephone|I was fitted for those garments when I first arrived. They... were not my customary style. So Hades has a portrait of me, still. Why would he put it back on display, now?
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Zagreus|No, no, he's never let anybody in his bedchambers! I broke in. Don't you see? He didn't put your portrait back on display. It's always been there! Ever since you left. So, Mother, why do you suppose he would do that?
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Persephone|Because he... because he loves me still. Is that what you want me to say?
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Zagreus|Have you ever loved him, yourself?
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Persephone|All I really wanted was to leave Olympus. I didn't exactly abscond. I doubt I had much of a choice, but I went willingly. Perhaps Zeus knew how I felt, and thought he was doing me a favor. As for Hades... I grew to love him, yes. He always gave me my space.
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Zagreus|Won't you... *urgh*... won't you please talk to him? Or visit Cerberus again, or Nyx? As for Olympus... surely all of you... can figure something out...?
PersephoneMeeting09|Persephone Meeting 09|Persephone|...I just don't know, my son. Olympus is behind me. And the Underworld... I cannot imagine I would be very welcome there after all this time.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Zagreus|Mother, wait, what is all this?
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|Oh, Zagreus, I almost missed you. Truthfully, I hoped that I could make it a surprise...
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Zagreus|Make what a surprise?
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|My arrival. I'm going. To your home. To Cerberus. Nyx. Your father.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Zagreus|You're... *really*?! Mother, you, you're serious?
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|I am. Now if you could just help me pack up my remaining things? Only a few loose odds I'm bringing, just in case. If we hurry, maybe you could join me, rather than return the customary way. Not something a mother ever wants to see.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Zagreus|Join you, but... wait, how are you going to get back? I... hadn't thought that far ahead.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|Just so happens I know somebody who can give us a ride.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|Doubtless he has pressing matters to attend to. So let's not keep him waiting any longer, Son. Come on, then!
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Zagreus|*<Sigh> *...I'm still alive... but, how?
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|You're on the River Styx. No longer in the mortal realm, entirely.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Zagreus|I can't believe that this is happening.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|I know. My heart is racing. Nothing like a river journey to remind oneself that there's no turning back.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Zagreus|Seriously. Though, even after all of this... it's like we only just met. I have so many questions for you still.
PersephoneReturnsHome01|Persephone Returns Home 01|Persephone|We'll have plenty of time for them, I think! For now, best we keep quiet. Pretend we're just a couple of dead souls on their final voyage.
PersephoneBoatRide02|Persephone Boat Ride 02|Zagreus|This is embarrassing, but... I don't know the way to get back in. Except, you know, the customary way.
PersephoneBoatRide02|Persephone Boat Ride 02|Persephone|That's quite all right; I do. *In the name of Persephone, the Queen*!! Open the gates!
PersephoneHomeMeeting01|Persephone Home Meeting 01|Zagreus|How has it been for you so far, Mother? Reacclimating to all this. You said before it was a struggle. Must be very strange, being back. Being in darkness all the time.
PersephoneHomeMeeting01|Persephone Home Meeting 01|Persephone|You know, I think it's gone all right so far! Thank you for asking, Son. Everyone has been quite welcoming. The darkness is a pleasant change of pace, and while this dress can be a little difficult to move in... I quite like it.
PersephoneHomeMeeting01|Persephone Home Meeting 01|Zagreus|That's good to hear. I have to admit I was a little worried you'd be desperate to return to your cottage by now. This place can be a little much.
PersephoneHomeMeeting01|Persephone Home Meeting 01|Persephone|I'm sure it can. And I do miss my little cottage here and there, but... I think I'm through running away. There may be times when it is necessary, of course. But no matter how far you run, it doesn't make your problems go away. You taught me that, you know.
PersephoneHomeMeeting01|Persephone Home Meeting 01|Zagreus|I did? But... I tried desperately to run away, myself.... Oh.
PersephoneHomeMeeting02|Persephone Home Meeting 02|Persephone|Turns out there's still an awful lot to do around here, isn't there, Zagreus? I'm still getting caught up on day-to-day affairs.
PersephoneHomeMeeting02|Persephone Home Meeting 02|Zagreus|Day-to-day, how can you even tell it's day around here, anyway, Mother?
PersephoneHomeMeeting02|Persephone Home Meeting 02|Persephone|Well that was just a guess, now that you mention it. In any case, forgive me if I don't get swooped up in every household detail, all right?
PersephoneHomeMeeting03|Persephone Home Meeting 03|Zagreus|So, Mother, all the pomegranates around here... those are your doing?
PersephoneHomeMeeting03|Persephone Home Meeting 03|Persephone|Not a lot of fruit trees take to this environment, my son. Though, there's something about pomegranates! Maybe it's that their seeds so resemble the gemstones your father likes so much. Or that they don't need much water.
PersephoneHomeMeeting03|Persephone Home Meeting 03|Zagreus|...Fruit trees, huh. I grew up around all these poms and never thought much of it. Are there many other types of fruit trees on the surface, then?
PersephoneHomeMeeting03|Persephone Home Meeting 03|Persephone|Well... I suppose there are a few. But I like pomegranates most of all.
PersephoneHomeMeeting04|Persephone Home Meeting 04|Zagreus|This garden isn't quite the sight yours was back on the surface, is it, Mother.
PersephoneHomeMeeting04|Persephone Home Meeting 04|Persephone|On the contrary, Zagreus! It has its own unique charm. As each garden does. I was impressed it wasn't left entirely to rot after my absence.
PersephoneHomeMeeting04|Persephone Home Meeting 04|Zagreus|It was totally off limits to me. Though I guess Father must have taken care to maintain it as best he could.
PersephoneHomeMeeting04|Persephone Home Meeting 04|Persephone|He did, all right. Minus the part where you weren't allowed. Though, let's look after it from here, shall we?
PersephoneHomeMeeting05|Persephone Home Meeting 05|Zagreus|You know, that painting in Father's... I mean your bedchambers, it turned out rather well, didn't it? Some very talented shades around here.
PersephoneHomeMeeting05|Persephone Home Meeting 05|Persephone|*Oh*, it's beautiful! I tried to persuade your father to hang it out in the hall but he's too coy about such things. Though, I like it where it is... a reminder to us, every day and night.
PersephoneHomeMeeting06|Persephone Home Meeting 06|Persephone|This garden may not have all the varieties available up on the surface... though it's coming along rather nicely, I should say!
PersephoneHomeMeeting07|Persephone Home Meeting 07|Persephone|It's lovely what you've done to this place, Zagreus! It's looking better than ever, thank you.
PersephoneRunCleared01|Persephone Run Cleared 01|Persephone|Were you able to make it to my cottage on the surface, Zagreus? I hope my lavender patches are doing all right.
PersephoneRunCleared01|Persephone Run Cleared 01|Zagreus|I, *erm*... I couldn't make it all the way there, Mother. It's like... without your presence on the surface, I'm unable to hang on for very long at all.
PersephoneRunCleared01|Persephone Run Cleared 01|Persephone|*Ah*, I was afraid of that. Well, don't despair. I placed a charm upon my seedlings there that ought to keep them flourishing well on their own. Your duty now is simply to escape. You keep it up!
PersephoneAboutHades01|Persephone About Hades 01|Persephone|Tell me something, Zagreus... sometimes I fear... do you hate him? I mean your father. Regardless of his intentions... it sounds as though he made your life extraordinarily difficult. All his pent-up fear and anger... you bore the brunt of it.
PersephoneAboutHades01|Persephone About Hades 01|Zagreus|Do I hate him...? Mother, I don't know that I hate anybody, really. The tales of him and the Olympians rending their immortal Titan parents to bits... I can't relate to how they must have felt. But, I resented him, for sure. And... I don't know if I'll ever get over that, entirely.
PersephoneAboutHades01|Persephone About Hades 01|Persephone|I understand. I think that when Hades told you he asked no forgiveness, he understood as well, and meant it. Well, for all his failings, I'm thankful that he did not teach you how to hate. For your own sake, if not for his.
PersephoneAboutHades02|Persephone About Hades 02|Persephone|So, how has it been between you and your father lately, Zagreus? I know the two of you have lots of work ahead of you. Especially him.
PersephoneAboutHades02|Persephone About Hades 02|Zagreus|Well, it's been all right, I guess. I think he's set in some of his ways. But at least we have some sort of understanding now. Even if he acts like everything is still the same when I'm out there on the job.
PersephoneAboutHades02|Persephone About Hades 02|Persephone|He says it's so you put forth your fullest effort every time. All this is a big adjustment for him as well. Not that it's any excuse for how he's treated you. Are you... all right, seeing us together?
PersephoneAboutHades03|Persephone About Hades 03|Zagreus|*Erm*, so are things with you and Father... everything all right, so far?
PersephoneAboutHades03|Persephone About Hades 03|Persephone|Things are good, Zagreus. I'm from Olympus... all the relationships I've ever known have been the complicated sort. But with your father... despite our different dispositions and interests... beneath it all, we share a simple understanding.
PersephoneAboutHades03|Persephone About Hades 03|Zagreus|And... what understanding is that? If you can share.
PersephoneAboutHades03|Persephone About Hades 03|Persephone|That we're all we've got. And that we love each other. Through thick and thin.
PersephoneAboutHades03|Persephone About Hades 03|Zagreus|Wait, you're not... you're not thinking about having more children, are you...?
PersephoneAboutNyx01|Persephone About Nyx 01|Persephone|Nyx has a very steady presence, doesn't she? I want to say she hasn't changed a bit since before you were born, but... I know that she's been through a lot.
PersephoneAboutNyx01|Persephone About Nyx 01|Zagreus|She's always managed, and quite gracefully at that. Never seen her break a sweat over anything. Even when I confronted her about you. Though, you two seem closer than I realized, I think.
PersephoneAboutNyx01|Persephone About Nyx 01|Persephone|Well, your father isn't always the conversationalist, and Nyx... she was the first chthonic god I ever met. I suppose she welcomed having another lady about the House.
PersephoneAboutNyx02|Persephone About Nyx 02|Persephone|Zagreus... how am I doing? As a mother. Tell me honestly. Nyx has had so much to share about raising you. Foods you hated or enjoyed, your natural abilities, your friendships... she knows everything! Sometimes I wonder how I can ever compete?
PersephoneAboutNyx02|Persephone About Nyx 02|Zagreus|Mother, I think you're doing great. And I'm sure you know it's not a competition between you and Nyx. I just get the benefit of having two great mothers rather than one. Or zero.
PersephoneAboutNyx02|Persephone About Nyx 02|Persephone|Thank you, my son. I know I wasn't there for most of the hard part, but... I'm here, now. Though, when I inevitably, inadvertently trample all over your feelings at some point, please tell me, all right?
PersephoneAboutCharon01|Persephone About Charon 01|Zagreus|Mother, one thing I was wondering about was, how did you summon Charon to your surface residence? Especially without, you know, being dead.
PersephoneAboutCharon01|Persephone About Charon 01|Persephone|*Oh*, why... he gave me his calling card after he graciously helped get me out of here the first time. No doubt at Nyx's request, but still. Never thought I'd use it, but... I still kept it. Just in case.
PersephoneBackstory01|Persephone Backstory 01|Zagreus|Mother, you'll forgive my asking, but... your mother used to call you by a different name, didn't she?
PersephoneBackstory01|Persephone Backstory 01|Persephone|*Ah*, don't remind me. Imagine if I called you *Zaggie-poo *from when you were born to this very moment, that's how that name felt to me. I much preferred the name my father gave to me.
PersephoneBackstory01|Persephone Backstory 01|Zagreus|Your mortal father, right...? So he called you Persephone. What was he like?
PersephoneBackstory01|Persephone Backstory 01|Persephone|He was kind to me. And funny! Little bringer of destruction, I was to him. I liked that. He was right, I was a terror. But then he passed. I was very little still. My mother never spoke of him again.
PersephoneBackstory01|Persephone Backstory 01|Zagreus|Demeter mentioned him a bit to me. She seems... I don't know, but I don't sense that she regrets the relationship or anything. Just sad about the outcome I think.
PersephoneBackstory01|Persephone Backstory 01|Persephone|I suppose I can see that. I thought I might end up like Father... growing old, wasting away. Then the time flew by, and I realized I was closer to Mother's side. Mortals certainly don't have it easy. But their limited days, it means... they live their lives to the fullest, I think.
PersephoneAboutEternalWinter01|Persephone About Eternal Winter 01|Zagreus|Mother, just how long has it been snowing on the surface, do you know? Because, it seems to me that Demeter... Grandmother, I should say, she... well, it's been very cold up there each time I've been.
PersephoneAboutEternalWinter01|Persephone About Eternal Winter 01|Persephone|I was afraid of that... I wanted to believe the snow about my cottage, it was native to the climate there, but... seems that Mother took my absence harder than I thought. Oh, what have I done. All those poor people.
PersephoneAboutEternalWinter01|Persephone About Eternal Winter 01|Zagreus|It's not your fault. You couldn't have known. And we can fix this, right?
PersephoneAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Persephone About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|Nyx told me that you helped her reconnect with her parent... after a long, long time. That was very kind of you. She never asks for anything. But we all owe her a lot, don't we?
PersephoneAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Persephone About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|I think so. If not for her... I can't even imagine, really. Did Nyx ever speak to you of Chaos, before I was born?
PersephoneAboutNyxChaosReunionQuest01|Persephone About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|Not really, no. Nyx is very private when it comes to personal matters. But she has feelings and desires same as anybody. Well, mostly, but the point is... I know this meant a lot to her.
PersephoneAboutMyrmidonReunionQuest01|Persephone About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|It seems Achilles had a complicated arrangement with your father. I understand you simplified things for the better, there, and he was able to visit Elysium at last. Well done.
PersephoneAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Persephone About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|So Orpheus was finally able to reunite with Eurydice because of you, my son? *Ah*, I'm so glad! Your father's arrangement with him was quite severe. Though he did ask for a lot, for a mortal soul to return to the land of the living...
PersephoneAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Persephone About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Is it even possible, for Father to return a mortal back to life if he so chose? Just by letting their shade escape, or something?
PersephoneAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Persephone About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|Oh, I've no idea, probably not? But we were so moved by Orpheus' plea and song, that, well... I think your father took pity on him.
PersephoneAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Persephone About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Wait, *we *were so moved? You were there when Orpheus came to try and rescue Eurydice?
PersephoneAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Persephone About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|I was. Your father knew I loved their music. Imagine my surprise to see him as our court musician, here!
PersephoneAboutThanatosRelationship01|Persephone About Thanatos Relationship 01|Persephone|I always fancied Thanatos, you know. So put together and everything! I'm pleased to see you've grown so close. Things good between you two?
PersephoneAboutDusaRelationship01|Persephone About Dusa Relationship 01|Persephone|That Dusa sure has quite the uplifting presence around here, doesn't she, Zagreus? Sometimes I see you chatting and it warms my heart.
PersephoneAboutDusaFiring01|Persephone About Dusa Firing 01|Persephone|Zagreus, I know you're upset about what happened between Nyx and Dusa. Before you ask... I need to respect Nyx's space and authority on this one, all right?
PersephoneAboutDusaFiring02|Persephone About Dusa Firing 02|Persephone|I saw that Dusa had returned. I trust Nyx's judgment, though I must admit I was pleased to see she decided to give her another chance.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|All right. We've matters with Olympus to resolve. They don't know I'm here, most of them, besides Zeus, maybe Athena. They think you're Nyx's son rather than mine, and that your goal is still to join them on their mountaintop.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|What a mess. What can we do? The gods of Olympus have all been very good to me, for the most part. I don't feel great about deceiving them. They keep trying to help me escape!
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|What can we do? We can make peace with them. And let them know the truth. So much of it as they would tolerate. Diplomacy is not your father's strong suit. But I am going to need you two to do exactly as I say. Do you understand?
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Yes, Mother. So what do you intend to do, and how do I fit in?
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|We're going to invite all of them to a little family gathering! Here. And you shall personally deliver them their invitations, Zagreus.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Mother, are you serious? So, we're just going to have a bash with them, and they'll just see you after all this time, and be fine with everything?
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|They certainly shall not be fine with everything. But, Hades and I, we'll be prepared to tell them what they need to hear. Don't worry, I shall do the talking.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|What are you going to say?
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|Oh, you know! That we met, fell in love, eloped. Had a child. A child who, once grown, sought desperately to reconnect with his extended family. To the chagrin of his grim lord father...
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|...Fortunately, our loving and dutiful son at last persuaded his mother and father to reveal their secretive relationship, and make an effort to rejoin their great family.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Your mother won't be happy that you left.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|I'll deal with her. Perhaps I'll have to visit her and the rest of them from time to time, if that's what it shall take. But I'll be back. I've no choice! Did you know that if you eat the seeds of an Underworld pomegranate, then you cannot leave for one month out of the year, per seed?
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|What? No, I never knew that.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|Neither do they.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|How soon is this family gathering you have in mind going to take place?
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Persephone|Soon after you invite them all, I hope. Now, go. And trust in me, all right? We have a lot to learn of trust, I think.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest02|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 02|Persephone|How goes the doling out of invitations, Zagreus? Have the Olympians been amenable to the idea?
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest02|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 02|Zagreus|Not just amenable, Mother. Positively intrigued. I can't believe you scrambled the invitations in such a way that, only with the lot of them combined will they get all of the details!
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest02|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 02|Persephone|A bit of collaboration seemed in the spirit of things. We're a great, big family, Zagreus. Past time we started acting like one, no? Now, keep it up. And thank you for your help.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest03|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 03|Zagreus|Mother, this family gathering you're planning... are all our relatives welcome? Because I was wondering if I could extend the invitation to a distant ancestor... you know... Chaos.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest03|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 03|Persephone|Nyx's parent... you've been in contact, then? Look, if you feel it's the right thing to do, I trust your judgment. The spirit of this event is to bring the family together.
PersephoneAboutOlympianReunionQuest03|Persephone About Olympian Reunion Quest 03|Zagreus|Thanks. I doubt Chaos would be able to attend, though would still appreciate the thought.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|It's done, Mother! Father. The invitations. Personally sent to everyone with whom I've been in contact. So, what do we do now?
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|Excellent, Zagreus! Congratulate him, Hades! On a job well done.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Hades|*Grr. *Persephone, how can you be so certain your request was executed to your satisfaction?
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|It's known as trust, Hades. Or faith? They're similar. Try one, sometime! It'll be good for you. As for what we do next... why, we've a great, big feast we must prepare!
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Hades|This House is not a suitable location for such guests! Dionysus, alone, shall bring ruin to this place! Or... *urgh*... the faith thing that you said.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|Yes, good! Now then... we have a lot of work to go around, so why don't we call everyone on staff, and let them in on this, and dole out suitable responsibilities, all right?
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Hades|All right....
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|All right.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|All right!
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|...*Whew*! I'd say that went about as well as could have been expected! And the cleanup wasn't all that bad. For the most part.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|We're fortunate Uncle Zeus seemed to catch on right away, and went along with it. But, this whole elaborate tale you spun... I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|And Uncle Zeus is glad things didn't turn out worse for *him*. I get the sense he acts a bit impulsively at times, and deals with the consequences later.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Persephone|What can I tell you, Zagreus? We're family. You said it yourself to me before: We're stuck with one another. That any of us like each other in the slightest... it's a wonder and a blessing, I think.
OlympianReunionQuestComplete|Olympian Reunion Quest Complete|Zagreus|Yeah. I know what you mean. Thanks, Mother. Think I'll be heading out again soon. See you when I get back?
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|I have to say, Mother, that was a clever plan. Convincing Father to finally let somebody have some fun around here.
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Persephone|*Haha*, well! I'm glad it worked out for the best. There's just one thing that happened that I ought to tell you about, Son. No secrets between us, and all. This... is quite difficult for me to say.
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|It's about Demeter, isn't it. You two were talking half the night. She wants you to come home with her, doesn't she? You'll always be her little one, something like that?
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Persephone|Indeed... something like that. You're quite perceptive, have I ever told you, Zagreus? But yes, my mother, she was quite conflicted. Didn't know whether to smite me or to hold me, maybe both. And, yes. She asked that I come home... to my responsibilities.
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|So... you're leaving...? No, Mother, you can't be leaving, you just got here!
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Persephone|Oh, it's not as bad as that, it's just... if we are to keep the peace down here, then, I must spend some time up there. Every so often! But, I shall always return, in no time at all. I promised Hades, and I promise you.
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|Well then... when are you going to go?
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Persephone|Soon, Zagreus. Perhaps by the time you're back.
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|I don't suppose... I can come with you, can I?
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Persephone|*Tsk*, you know the surface isn't good for you! Besides, you're needed here. But, if you really want to see it for yourself, someday, who knows? Perhaps eventually we'll figure out a way.
PersephoneLeavesToOlympus01|Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01|Zagreus|I'm going to miss you, Mother.
PersephoneReturnsFromOlympus01|Persephone Returns From Olympus 01|Zagreus|Welcome home, Mother! How was your trip, things go all right with you and Demeter? With... Grandmother. Still getting used to thinking of her that way.
PersephoneReturnsFromOlympus01|Persephone Returns From Olympus 01|Persephone|You know, it's funny... I think she was so overwhelmed to see me again that maybe something finally changed in her. I always thought she was utterly unyielding. She asked me if I truly came here by choice, and I put her at ease.
PersephoneReturnsFromOlympus01|Persephone Returns From Olympus 01|Zagreus|Ah, that's a relief. Grandmother can be rather intense, but... she's been kind to me, and very helpful, too. Do you suppose she'll ease up on the whole eternal winter thing there on the surface, now that she knows you're safe?
PersephoneReturnsFromOlympus01|Persephone Returns From Olympus 01|Persephone|I asked. She told me that she would. Warmth shall return to the surface. Some of the time, at least. Likely on a rigid schedule, knowing her. And perhaps not in the vicinity of our domain. She's not the sort to forgive and simply forget.
PersephoneWithHades01|Duo - Persephone and Hades (1)|Persephone|...*Oh*, come on, Hades! Mortals are much more resilient than that! What, you think they'll show up at your gates here, all at once? They have our family looking out for them.
PersephoneWithHades01|Duo - Persephone and Hades (1)|Hades|That is what I'm afraid of. Do you truly believe my brothers and the rest shall take the sort of care of them while they draw breath, as we do here after they have expired?
PersephoneWithHades01|Duo - Persephone and Hades (1)|Persephone|It's true we have to look out for them indefinitely, while Olympus need only look out for them for a little while. But our relatives are always watching from their mountain! And if they do turn a blind eye once in a while... mortals aren't bad at fending for themselves.
PersephoneWithHades01|Duo - Persephone and Hades (1)|Hades|But they are never satisfied! Always begging us to provide more, and more.
PersephoneWithHades01|Duo - Persephone and Hades (1)|Persephone|They *like *us, Hades! They praise us, tell one another about us. What do you expect? Would you rather they forgot about us?
PersephoneWithHades01|Duo - Persephone and Hades (1)|Hades|...No. No, I suppose not. But they *need *us!
PersephoneWithHades02|Duo - Persephone and Hades (2)|Hades|...And what of the complaints from Elysium? They wanted the lawns thoroughly manicured for their athletic contests.
PersephoneWithHades02|Duo - Persephone and Hades (2)|Persephone|Already taken care of. Though, the flooding in Asphodel, *hm*, that doesn't look like something we can clear up for quite some time. Fortunately, the residents seem to be getting accustomed to it.
PersephoneWithHades02|Duo - Persephone and Hades (2)|Hades|There have been fewer reports about it as of late. And what of the Satyr problem? Blasted things are rampant up there, still.
PersephoneWithHades02|Duo - Persephone and Hades (2)|Persephone|Well, they're probably contained up there, at least. And Zagreus has been keeping them in check, hasn't he?
PersephoneWithHades03|Duo - Persephone and Hades (3)|Hades|...Well, be that as it may... if they pester you at all, do let me know, and I shall have them dealt with quickly.
PersephoneWithHades03|Duo - Persephone and Hades (3)|Persephone|*Oh*, Hades... I think the shades around here have been through enough as it is! I don't mind them. After all the time I spent on my own, having some company has been a welcome change.
PersephoneWithHades03|Duo - Persephone and Hades (3)|Hades|You are certain all your needs have been provided for? Because if there is anything that you require...
PersephoneWithHades03|Duo - Persephone and Hades (3)|Persephone|*Require*? Look at this place, Hades. Look at *me*! I have everything! And so do you. Try not to worry quite so much. And be patient with your son. That's all I ask.
PersephoneWithHades03|Duo - Persephone and Hades (3)|Hades|Persephone, I cannot promise you such things, they're... not my strengths. Besides, I have a reputation to uphold! *God of the dead*! If the wretches do not fear me, or *you *for that matter... what, then?
PersephoneWithHades03|Duo - Persephone and Hades (3)|Persephone|I'm not going to tell you how to balance your work, your marriage, and your parental responsibilities. I don't think anybody on Olympus or below knows quite how best to manage that. So long as we do our best.
PersephoneWithHades04|Duo - Persephone and Hades (4)|Hades|...Sometimes, I... still cannot believe that you are here. Returned to us. Your radiance, in all this darkness... you must miss seeing the coast.
PersephoneWithHades04|Duo - Persephone and Hades (4)|Persephone|The coast was nice enough, Hades. But nothing is ever perfect, right? No matter how hard you try. Still... I think we get quite close around here, every once in a while.
PersephoneWithHades04|Duo - Persephone and Hades (4)|Hades|You have taken much less time adjusting to this place than when first you joined us. Part of my surprise. I, myself, was forced to be here. I never thought anyone would come from the surface here by choice.
PersephoneWithHades04|Duo - Persephone and Hades (4)|Persephone|The heart can make us do the strangest things, can't it?
PersephoneWithNyx01|Duo - Persephone and Nyx (1)|Persephone|...So if there's anything that I can do for you, Nyx, you need but ask, all right? I plan to pull my weight.
PersephoneWithNyx01|Duo - Persephone and Nyx (1)|Nyx|Your services were always welcome, here. Please acclimate yourself at your own rate. I am available to answer any questions you may have at any time.
PersephoneWithNyx01|Duo - Persephone and Nyx (1)|Persephone|Thank you, my friend. I have to tell you... it's good to be back.
PersephoneWithNyx02|Duo - Persephone and Nyx (2)|Persephone|...I just don't know how I can ever repay you. For raising him. For *everything*. After I left... besides old Cerberus, I think maybe I missed you most of all.
PersephoneWithNyx02|Duo - Persephone and Nyx (2)|Nyx|I can remember feeling similar emotions at the time. However, it is quite unnecessary to give thanks to me this way. You are the Queen, safely returned where you belong. I did what anybody would have in my place.
PersephoneWithNyx02|Duo - Persephone and Nyx (2)|Persephone|Anybody would have lovingly raised my estranged son, while keeping safe my secret, eventually orchestrating an elaborate plot to reunite him with me, so that I might someday return, to have a Nectar with them in the lounge?
PersephoneWithCerberus01|Duo - Persephone and Cerberus (1)|Persephone|Oh, Cerberus! Doubtless you deserve the biggest thanks that this House still stands, don't you? Did you enjoy the treat I brought you from the surface?
PersephoneWithCerberus01|Duo - Persephone and Cerberus (1)|Storyteller|*The surface-treat-devouring hound of hell provides the Queen a most decidedly affirmative response.*
PersephoneWithCerberus01|Duo - Persephone and Cerberus (1)|Persephone|I thought you might. You wouldn't know it wasn't made of meat, I'll bet! I'll see if we can't grow you plenty more.
PersephoneWithCerberus02|Duo - Persephone and Cerberus (2)|Persephone|You're such a good boy, aren't you, Cerberus? Yes you are! Guarded the place while I was out. And even let my son come visit me!
PersephoneWithCerberus02|Duo - Persephone and Cerberus (2)|Storyteller|*The ever-vigilant and terrifying Cerberus merely accepts the praise.*
PersephoneChat01|Persephone Chat 01|Persephone|I'm sorry, Zagreus, I've pressing matters to attend to now.
PersephoneChat02|Persephone Chat 02|Persephone|Do let me know if I can help with anything, all right?
PersephoneChat03|Persephone Chat 03|Persephone|Your father's prouder of you than you think.
PersephoneChat04|Persephone Chat 04|Persephone|Go make us proud, my son.
PersephoneChat05|Persephone Chat 05|Persephone|Keeping the realm secure as ever, right?
PersephoneChat06|Persephone Chat 06|Persephone|It's always nice to have a chat with you.
PersephoneChat07|Persephone Chat 07|Persephone|I think the House is well enough in order as of late.
PersephoneChat08|Persephone Chat 08|Persephone|I hope your last assignment turned out well.
PersephoneChat09|Persephone Chat 09|Persephone|Do give yourself a break from time to time!
PersephoneChat10|Persephone Chat 10|Persephone|I ever tell you you're the best son that a mother's ever had?
PersephoneChat11|Persephone Chat 11|Persephone|Hope my little cottage on the coast is holding up!
PersephoneChat12|Persephone Chat 12|Persephone|Please keep an eye on my garden on the surface when you get a chance.
PersephoneChat13|Persephone Chat 13|Persephone|I'd say this garden's doing quite all right for now.
PersephoneChat14|Persephone Chat 14|Persephone|Don't let your father get to you too much, all right?
PersephoneChat15|Persephone Chat 15|Persephone|You're looking just as well as ever, Zagreus.
PersephoneChat16|Persephone Chat 16|Persephone|You show your father who's in charge next chance you get, all right?
PersephoneChat17|Persephone Chat 17|Persephone|The pomegranate trees are coming in nicely still, the tough old things.
PersephoneChat18|Persephone Chat 18|Persephone|You'll let me know if there's something that I can do for you?
PersephoneLeavingChat01|Persephone Leaving Chat 01|Persephone|We have to say farewell again, for now, my son. Olympus calls, but I'll be back, all right?
PersephoneLeavingChat02|Persephone Leaving Chat 02|Persephone|I shall be leaving again for Olympus soon. I'll miss you, Son.
PersephoneLeavingChat03|Persephone Leaving Chat 03|Persephone|I must go visit Mother on Olympus, Zagreus. I'll tell her you said hi.
PersephoneLeavingChat04|Persephone Leaving Chat 04|Persephone|I have to go again, soon, Zagreus, all right? I'll see you soon.
PersephoneLeavingChat05|Persephone Leaving Chat 05|Persephone|I'm due to visit Mount Olympus once again, so please be good to one another while I'm out.
PersephoneLeavingChat06|Persephone Leaving Chat 06|Persephone|Time that I headed up to Mount Olympus, though you keep an eye on things till I get back?
PersephoneLeavingChat07|Persephone Leaving Chat 07|Persephone|I have to go now, Zagreus, but I shall see you just as soon as I return.
PersephoneReturnedChat01|Persephone Returned Chat 01|Persephone|Things are well enough upon Olympus. Though, it's a relief to have come home again.
PersephoneReturnedChat02|Persephone Returned Chat 02|Persephone|Don't think I'll ever get fully accustomed to Olympus, Son.
PersephoneReturnedChat03|Persephone Returned Chat 03|Persephone|Zagreus, you're the most welcome sight I've seen in quite some time.
PersephoneReturnedChat04|Persephone Returned Chat 04|Persephone|Always such an exhausting journey, from Olympus down to here.
PersephoneReturnedChat05|Persephone Returned Chat 05|Persephone|I trust that you and Hades have been good to one another since I left?
PersephoneReturnedChat06|Persephone Returned Chat 06|Persephone|I'll tell you, it is so much colder up there on that mountaintop.
PersephoneReturnedChat07|Persephone Returned Chat 07|Persephone|This is a welcome sight from all the snow-capped mountaintops.
PersephoneChatWithNyx01|Duo - Chat and Nyx (1)|Persephone|Oh we're busy just formulating more of our dark schemes together, Zagreus.
PersephoneChatWithNyx02|Duo - Chat and Nyx (2)|Persephone|Nyx here is a wellspring of parental advice, as it turns out!
PersephoneChatWithNyx03|Duo - Chat and Nyx (3)|Persephone|Nyx was just telling me some more about your early days, my son.
PersephoneChatWithNyx04|Duo - Chat and Nyx (4)|Persephone|It seems I failed once again to persuade Nyx to take some personal time!
PersephoneChatWithHades01|Duo - Chat and Hades (1)|Persephone|Please excuse your father and me for the moment, Zagreus.
PersephoneChatWithHades02|Duo - Chat and Hades (2)|Persephone|Go on, Hades. Try saying something nice to him, for once.
PersephoneChatWithHades03|Duo - Chat and Hades (3)|Persephone|Your father and I still have a bit of work here to wrap up.
PersephoneChatWithHades04|Duo - Chat and Hades (4)|Persephone|The work certainly never ceases, Zagreus!
PersephoneChatWithHades05|Duo - Chat and Hades (5)|Persephone|More than enough parchmentwork to go around!
PersephoneChatWithHades06|Duo - Chat and Hades (6)|Persephone|Plenty of parchmentwork to contend with, I can assure you, Zagreus!
PersephoneChatWithHades07|Duo - Chat and Hades (7)|Persephone|Don't go too hard on each other out there, all right?
PersephoneChatWithHades08|Duo - Chat and Hades (8)|Persephone|I've heard that you've been doing great out there lately, Zagreus.
PersephoneGift01|Persephone Gift 01|Zagreus|*Erm*, Mother? Was it always a custom in Father's House to secretly give Nectar to those you care about? I guess it also could have been a thing on Olympus. Look, I wanted you to have this. I'm so glad I found you.
PersephoneGift01|Persephone Gift 01|Persephone|Oh, Zagreus, you're so thoughtful, truly! Your father never permitted Nectar out in the open so I'd practically forgotten its savor. Though, just a moment, I have something for you, too!
PersephoneGift02|Persephone Gift 02|Persephone|For me? Are you quite sure? You know, this vintage must have made it all the way up from the surface, to the mountains, then to here. We've both had distant journeys, haven't we?
PersephoneGift02|Persephone Gift 02|Zagreus|Well, I, for one, am certain this vintage here has journeyed to the right place. Please enjoy it.
PersephoneGift03|Persephone Gift 03|Persephone|I must confess I do enjoy having a good bottle of Nectar, every now and then. And you appear to have a careful eye for such bottles, from what I can tell!
PersephoneGift03|Persephone Gift 03|Zagreus|My careful eye has got to be the green one, hasn't it. To having a discerning eye, Mother!
PersephoneGift04|Persephone Gift 04|Persephone|Thank you very much, my son! You know, gift-giving customs of the Underworld are just so much more straightforward than the complicated social graces of Olympus!
PersephoneGift04|Persephone Gift 04|Zagreus|If there are other ways of showing one's appreciation than with Nectar and the like, well, they must pale in comparison I'm sure!
PersephoneGift05|Persephone Gift 05|Persephone|*Oh*, this is wonderful, except... I'm wracked with guilt for having nothing much to give you, in return. You never even got a mother's love from me.
PersephoneGift05|Persephone Gift 05|Zagreus|Please don't say that, it's just a gift, all right? Besides... can't we start now? Mother and son type things. If you would like.
PersephoneGift05|Persephone Gift 05|Persephone|I'd like that even more than this fine Nectar, Zagreus!
PersephoneGift06|Persephone Gift 06|Persephone|Somebody raised you very well indeed, my son. Nyx, I suppose. I'll never be half the mother she is. She's done it for aeons! While I'm only getting started.
PersephoneGift06|Persephone Gift 06|Zagreus|For what it's worth, I happen to think you're off to an excellent start. Nyx did teach me a lot. Achilles, too, and Father, in a way. But there is no replacing your presence. I felt that before we ever met. And now I know for sure.
PersephoneGift06|Persephone Gift 06|Persephone|Thank you, Zagreus. Let's hope you're right. I nurtured very many plants, at least, of that I can assure you! Perhaps my gardening experience provided a bit of a head start on this whole mothering thing.
PersephoneGift07|Persephone Gift 07|Zagreus|Mother, I know there may not be many things you miss from living on Olympus, though I wondered if perhaps Ambrosia may be one of them. And got you some, because... well, here.
PersephoneGift07|Persephone Gift 07|Persephone|...Why, this really is Ambrosia! How did you even acquire this, Zagreus? It brings back memories, for certain. And, never the bad ones, which... I think it must be why we prize this stuff so much. This is for me?
PersephoneGift07|Persephone Gift 07|Zagreus|It is, it is, of course! And, it's my dearest hope that, at some point long from now, when you're relaxing with a bottle of Ambrosia, dare I say perhaps with Father... that these memories will be among the ones that spring to mind.
PersephoneGift07|Persephone Gift 07|Persephone|*Oh*, my son... I shall certainly not need Ambrosia to think back upon getting to know you with the greatest fondness. Thank you very much.
PersephoneGift08|Persephone Gift 08|Zagreus|Here, Mother. More bottled pleasant memories for you. I know you're glad you've long since left Olympus, but... I'm glad you were there, because the experience of it must have played no small part in making you who you are.
PersephoneGift08|Persephone Gift 08|Persephone|You know, the last bottle you gave me brought more pleasant memories than I expected. No telling just how many more of them I've tucked away. Say, would it be all right if I shared this with your father?
PersephoneGift08|Persephone Gift 08|Zagreus|It is yours to do with as you please.
PersephoneGift08|Persephone Gift 08|Persephone|*Haha*, almost sounded like a *no *to me!

PersephoneGift08|Persephone Gift 08|Persephone|Nonsense, there's also Cerberus! Present company excluded. Come on, Son. Your father has a lot of work to do, but I'm absolutely certain that he has fond memories of you. Though, I know that isn't reassuring, coming from me.
PersephoneGift08|Persephone Gift 08|Zagreus|Everything is somehow reassuring, coming from you, Mother.
PersephoneGift09|Persephone Gift 09|Zagreus|I thought about it more, Mother, and I would like very much if you and Father were to share this. Though, maybe don't let on where you got it, just in case?
PersephoneGift09|Persephone Gift 09|Persephone|This is splendid, Zagreus, but please! If there's one thing I've learned since we met, it's that the trust we share is at the very foundation of our relationships. Why shouldn't he know who this is from? Besides, I think he could figure it out.
PersephoneGift09|Persephone Gift 09|Zagreus|Well, when it came to the Olympians, you said yourself that there was only so much truth that they could tolerate. Are you sure Father would be tolerant knowing I got this for the both of you?
PersephoneGift09|Persephone Gift 09|Persephone|I'm sure enough! And if he isn't, I suppose it's more for me.
PersephoneGift09|Persephone Gift 09|Zagreus|*Haha*, well! Just as long as someone puts it to good use.
PersephoneGift09|Persephone Gift 09|Persephone|...You know I always wanted to be a mother, Zagreus? But after you were born... I was certain I had lost my chance. Then one fine morning you just walked into my life. And here we are. I still cannot entirely believe it. What I mean is... I love you, Son. I'm doing my best.
PersephoneGift09|Persephone Gift 09|Zagreus|I know. I love you, too, Mother.
