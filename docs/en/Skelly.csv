SkellyHintMeeting01|Skelly Hint Meeting 01|Skelly|Let me give you a piece of advice, boyo. You run across a guy like me out there, you just give him a good stab right in the back without a second thought before he sends you crying back to Papa.
SkellyHintMeeting02|Skelly Hint Meeting 02|Skelly|You getting pretty strong, I'll give you that, boyo.

SkellyHintMeeting03|Skelly Hint Meeting 03|Skelly|Hey pal watch where you throw those bloodstone things of yours, you drop them, you go pick them up, you understand? But if somebody gives you grief, you got my permission to chuck one right in his eye!
SkellyHintMeeting03|Skelly Hint Meeting 03|Zagreus|I'll just aim generally for the midsection since the eyes are a lot harder to hit in my experience.

SkellyHintMeeting06|Skelly Hint Meeting 06|Skelly|Once in a while, pal, you're going to see a real fancy bozo try to ruin your good time. You'll know him 'cause he's glowing like a light, but that's his special armor, see? You got to punch right through it, he's going to shrug you off until you do!

SkellyHintMeeting09|Skelly Hint Meeting 09|Zagreus|Crush the souls of Elysium's Exalted shades to stop them from regenerating over and over. I'll definitely do that next time I'm there.

SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|What's his angle?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|No idea. Maybe he likes you, maybe he's bored.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|And Hermes... he's working for Charon, too?
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Yep! Now, let's pretend like none of this ever happened, so I can stick around, all right? Remember, pal, you promised!
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Zagreus|All right, fess up, Skelly, who are you working for? I know it's not Achilles. It's not Nyx. Dusa has no idea who you are. My father... no way. Hypnos? Give me a break. So the House is ruled out.
SkellyAboutSources02|Skelly About Sources 02|Skelly|Sorry, pal, my lips are sealed. How about we change the subject?

SkellyAboutGifting01|Skelly About Gifting 01|Zagreus|What, Skelly, you worried something bad is going to happen if I express a bit of generosity from time to time through our somewhat-illicit gift-giving custom around here?
SkellyAboutGifting01|Skelly About Gifting 01|Skelly|No, I'm worried you'll be wasting your time! If you give that stuff away, don't expect to get anything back. Well, not after the first time, anyway. Usually! I'm just saying... don't get your hopes up.

SkellyAboutSuperLockKeys02|Skelly About Super Lock Keys 02|Skelly|Wouldn't know a thing about it! Definitely doesn't have anything to do with those Infernal Arms of yours, some of which appear to still be {#DialogueItalicFormat}unavailable to you{#PreviousFormat}, as I understand?

SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 01|Skelly|So the strangest thing happened while you were out, boyo! One of your weapon holder things back there, it picked up this eerie glow! Could see it from the corner of my eye!
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 01|Zagreus|Calm down, Skelly. I'm sure whatever it is is perfectly normal for a legendary semi-sentient Titan-slaying weapon from the dawn of time.
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments01|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 01|Skelly|That's just it! Those weapons of yours, they have seen some real business, pal. You're giving them a real workout, so maybe they're starting to like you or something? Loosening up a bit, you know? Like you and me!

SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments02|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 02|Zagreus|Can't blame you, mate. I wouldn't want to be stuck in a chamber with a bunch of legendary, quite possibly malevolent killing artifacts. Anything I can do?
SkellyAboutWeaponEnchantments02|Skelly About Weapon Enchantments 02|Skelly|Oh I didn't mean it like a bad thing, boyo! The weirder you make those things, the more it gives me the shakes, and keeps me hopping like this nice and steady till the next time you get back! So, thanks!

SkellyAboutFistWeapon01|Skelly About Fist Weapon 01|Skelly|Nope! Not any of my business, pal, which is to say, I didn't see a thing! And even if I did, it isn't what I'm paid to do! Don't you have someone in your fancy House there paid to keep watch over stuff like that? Ask them!

SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Zagreus|Oh, gods... Skelly, what did you do...?
SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Skelly|Relax, boyo, just had a little chat with your old serving platter over there after you left, is all. That thing hits pretty hard!

SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Zagreus|So you carelessly spoke secret words imparted by the Fates themselves to an infernal weapon forged at the dawn of creation, then what? Say, did you walk up to Aegis, or just shout over your shoulder?
SkellyAboutGuanYuAspect01|Skelly About Guan Yu Aspect 01|Skelly|Over my shoulder! Anyway, what happened next was {#DialogueItalicFormat}nothing{#PreviousFormat}!
