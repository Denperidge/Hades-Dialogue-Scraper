FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Megaera|My sisters and I. We've had a chance to talk, and we have come to an agreement, Zagreus. As you can see.
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Alecto|Megaera, Tis, you ready?
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Tisiphone|*Mmurdererr*!
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Zagreus|Three against one. Doesn't seem all that sporting, now, does it?
FurySistersUnion01|Fury Sisters Union 01|Megaera|We're each well past the need for any sport. We'll kill you, whatever it takes. Erinyes! *Now*.
FurySisterUnionSingleSis01|Fury Sister Union Single Sis 01|Megaera|See, Alecto? He is right on time, just as I said.
FurySisterUnionSingleSis01|Fury Sister Union Single Sis 01|Alecto|Megaera, *bleed *him!
Fury2SisterUnion01|Fury 2 Sister Union 01|Alecto|You ready, Megaera? Tisiphone? Let's go.
Fury2SisterUnionSingleSis01|Fury 2 Sister Union Single Sis 01|Alecto|Check it out, Sis! The god of trash is here. Let's get to work.
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg01|Duo - Union and Meg (1)|Alecto|*Ugh*, would you just *look *at him! That smug look, that posture, *everything*! Please tell me you're not going soft for this trash-god, Sister.
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg01|Duo - Union and Meg (1)|Megaera|Come on, Alecto. When was the last time that we looked to one another for approval? Besides, as long as we kill him, what do you even care?
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg01|Duo - Union and Meg (1)|Alecto|You know, fair point, there, Sister! Very nicely said. *Let's kill him, now*!
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg02|Duo - Union and Meg (2)|Alecto|Look at this awful piece of trash, come here again to bleed all over our nice shiny floor. Ready to fight my lovely sister, there, redblood?
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg02|Duo - Union and Meg (2)|Megaera|He's not so awful once you get to know him, Sis. Not that it matters for what we're about to do.
Fury2SisterUnionWithMeg02|Duo - Union and Meg (2)|Alecto|The both of you disgust me, Meg, you know that? Get it together and *kill *him this time, damn you!
Fury2PactReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Reaction 01|Alecto|You must have gone and signed a Pact! Isn't that right, redblood? Tell me right now.
Fury2PactReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Reaction 01|Zagreus|Well, as a matter of fact, I have. Though I don't see how that's any business of yours, Alecto.
Fury2PactReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Reaction 01|Alecto|I like working *alone*! And you don't see me doing that, right now, do you? So I would say it's my business, all right. Along with killing *you*!
Fury2PactDisabledReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Disabled Reaction 01|Alecto|*Whew*, I thought I'd never get some quiet time again, you know, redblood? That damned Pact you stupidly agreed to, making me work with my sisters again. I'll get you for that!
Fury2PactDisabledReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Disabled Reaction 01|Zagreus|I'm sensing a pattern that it really doesn't take much for you to have something to *get *me for, does it?
Fury2PactDisabledReaction01|Fury 2 Pact Disabled Reaction 01|Alecto|Oh, that's rich! How smart of you, you're *smart*! Know what? I'll get you for that, too.
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Alecto|*Ah, hah hah, hohohohohhh. *Finally. I've been waiting for this! Really.
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Zagreus|You must be one of Megaera's lovely sisters, I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Waiting for what, exactly?
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Alecto|...So sick of, you know, doing my regular job, uninterrupted. Not having to clean up Meg's messes!
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Zagreus|I get the feeling we're starting off on the wrong foot.
Fury2FirstAppearance|Fury 2 First Appearance|Alecto|Anyway. I always wanted to kill a god. You'll have to do.
Fury2PostEnding01|Fury 2 Post Ending 01|Alecto|Heard rumblings about some news back at your daddy's House, redblood. So his illustrious abducted Queen, she's come back home?!
Fury2PostEnding01|Fury 2 Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Wait, how do you even know all that? And should you really be talking about the Queen that way?
Fury2PostEnding01|Fury 2 Post Ending 01|Alecto|I don't answer to her! She can come and go as she wants for all I care. But you want to know who can't?! Yeah, you.
Fury2PostEnding02|Fury 2 Post Ending 02|Alecto|I got to ask, how come you keep on showing up, redblood? I thought you would have had enough beatings by now.
Fury2PostEnding02|Fury 2 Post Ending 02|Zagreus|Well, you know, I've come to enjoy these visits with you so much, Alecto, that I've made it something of a regular routine. Form good habits, and then stick to them, I say!
Fury2PostEnding02|Fury 2 Post Ending 02|Alecto|You call this a good habit, huh? Maybe for me, it is. Well, come here all you like, and I will be here waiting, *every single time*! About once every three times, anyway.
Fury2PostEpilogue01|Fury 2 Post Epilogue 01|Alecto|Heard you had a real bash down in your daddy's House, redblood. So sorry I couldn't make it. Next time, though, all right?
Fury2PostEpilogue01|Fury 2 Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Next time, definitely, Alecto. We missed you for sure and wish you could have made it!
Fury2PostEpilogue01|Fury 2 Post Epilogue 01|Alecto|*Hohoho*, I'm sure you did. But, you know, work comes first! So let's get busy.
Fury2EndOfDiscussion01|Fury 2 End Of Discussion 01|Alecto|Hey, redblood. I have done a lot of thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that I want you *never *to speak to me again. *Ever*. Got that?
Fury2EndOfDiscussion01|Fury 2 End Of Discussion 01|Zagreus|...*Erm*, I don't know how to respond to what you said without directly disobeying your request, Alecto. But for future reference, fine, I'll bite.
Fury2EndOfDiscussion01|Fury 2 End Of Discussion 01|Alecto|You'll *die*! There's no use standing here flapping our gums when we could cut to killing one another right away. Come on!
Fury2LowHealth01|Fury 2 Low Health 01|Alecto|*Ahh*, look at you, redblood. You're practically already dead! Now that's no fun at all.
Fury2LowHealth01|Fury 2 Low Health 01|Zagreus|Sorry to disappoint you, Alecto. I know you enjoy being responsible for a hundred percent of my bloodshed.
Fury2LowHealth01|Fury 2 Low Health 01|Alecto|Oh, that's all right, no hard feelings at all! You just be sure to get in better health before next I get to kill you, hm?
Fury2LowHealth02|Fury 2 Low Health 02|Alecto|You know I smelled your blood from three chambers away? Hope you saved some of it for me.
Fury2LowHealth02|Fury 2 Low Health 02|Zagreus|I've saved some of my blood, yes! Though I was thinking I'd hang onto it for now, if you don't mind.
Fury2LowHealth02|Fury 2 Low Health 02|Alecto|Do I look like someone who doesn't mind, trash god? I'll take your blood, however much you've got.
Fury2LowHealth03|Fury 2 Low Health 03|Alecto|What's the matter, redblood? You look a little paler than usual. Been bleeding much, having to get this far?
Fury2LowHealth03|Fury 2 Low Health 03|Zagreus|I ran into some setbacks, if you have to know. But don't worry, I'm sure I've plenty left to bleed.
Fury2LowHealth03|Fury 2 Low Health 03|Alecto|Oh *whew*, that's a relief all right! I was so worried that I wasn't going to be the one to kill you this time.
Fury2LowHealth04|Fury 2 Low Health 04|Alecto|You're looking pretty beat already, there, redblood. So let's finish you off.
Fury2LowHealth05|Fury 2 Low Health 05|Alecto|Next time, don't you go losing so much blood before you get here, trash! I like to take it out of you myself.
Fury2MiscEncounter01|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 01|Alecto|You're no god! You're nothing but a piece of trash. Born into all of this. And you don't even want it!
Fury2MiscEncounter01|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 01|Zagreus|You seem to have me all figured out. And here I thought we were still getting to know each other.
Fury2MiscEncounter01|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 01|Alecto|*Tsch*. Well. You want to know what I want? Here, I'll show you.
Fury2MiscEncounter02|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 02|Alecto|You know what I like about you? The way you bleed. *Mmm*.
Fury2MiscEncounter02|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 02|Zagreus|That... is not the type of flattery I'm used to. You're making me a bit uncomfortable, I'll have you know.
Fury2MiscEncounter02|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 02|Alecto|Never met a god that bleeds like you. Red. Like a worthless mortal. Come on! Let's bleed you dry.
Fury2MiscEncounter03|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 03|Alecto|Let's get to work, redblood, what do you say? Me, I say you've kept this girl waiting long enough.
Fury2MiscEncounter03|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 03|Zagreus|Well, I say I don't appreciate you calling me redblood. You're making me rather self-conscious about it, you know.
Fury2MiscEncounter03|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 03|Alecto|*Oh, hoho*, you're funny. But you'll break. They always do.
Fury2MiscEncounter04|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 04|Alecto|I have got to admit, you are really frustrating, you know, redblood? What is it going to take to make you scream, hm?
Fury2MiscEncounter04|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 04|Zagreus|What, you mean to say Meg never told you? And here I thought you two were close.
Fury2MiscEncounter04|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 04|Alecto|*Ehh*, we'll find out. I've got plenty of ideas left I've been meaning to try.
Fury2MiscEncounter05|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 05|Alecto|You know something, redblood? In retrospect, I should have known this wasn't going to be a quick job.
Fury2MiscEncounter05|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 05|Zagreus|They say both gods and mortals are notoriously poor at estimating how long it takes to get anything done.
Fury2MiscEncounter05|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 05|Alecto|Normally when I'm on the job, they grovel, then they scream. They shut up eventually, but not you. At least, not yet.
Fury2MiscEncounter06|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 06|Alecto|*Huh*! You really must like pain an awful lot, redblood. Or maybe it's just me.
Fury2MiscEncounter06|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 06|Zagreus|You see, Alecto? Turns out we do have a common interest after all.
Fury2MiscEncounter06|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 06|Alecto|Did you just--? Don't you *ever *compare yourself to me again, you trash. You want more pain, I'm happy to oblige.
Fury2MiscEncounter07|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 07|Alecto|I've got a lot to be thankful for, you know, redblood? Your daddy could have shut you in the lowest pits, and then we never would have met!
Fury2MiscEncounter07|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 07|Zagreus|Perish the thought, Alecto. What would you have done with yourself if not for all our fated encounters?
Fury2MiscEncounter07|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 07|Alecto|I don't know! I mean, before we met, I flayed all sorts of other trash down here! But lately I've been keeping them waiting, because of you.
Fury2MiscEncounter08|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 08|Alecto|Good job, redblood! You made it all this way! But, I have got to send you back to daddy, now. Nothing personal!
Fury2MiscEncounter08|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 08|Zagreus|Wish you could join me, Alecto. Want me to put in a good word with Father next time, so you can come visit us at the House yourself?
Fury2MiscEncounter08|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 08|Alecto|Oh, you know, I'd rather have my eyes put out, but thanks for offering! Now, time to head on home.
Fury2MiscEncounter09|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 09|Alecto|You know, redblood, my appointments usually don't come to *me*, much less again and again! Think I'm here to show you a good time, huh?!
Fury2MiscEncounter09|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 09|Zagreus|Alecto, I just like to see you menacingly smile. And, hey, having to deal with you now and again beats having to fight Meg all the time.
Fury2MiscEncounter09|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 09|Alecto|*Whaa*?! You think dealing with *me *beats dealing with that *weakling*? *Graaaah*!
Fury2MiscEncounter10|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 10|Alecto|How many times is it going to take, redblood? *How many*?! Tell me! How can you stand running into me like this, over and over?
Fury2MiscEncounter10|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 10|Zagreus|Well, habits can be hard to break. As for how many times, I've really no idea. Though I guess there's one way to find out.
Fury2MiscEncounter10|Fury 2 Misc Encounter 10|Alecto|I'll give you one thing... I like it when my prey bites back. Come on, let's see some blood again.
Fury2AboutTisiphoneSpeech01|Fury 2 About Tisiphone Speech 01|Alecto|Tisiphone's started to say the strangest things, lately, redblood. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Fury2AboutTisiphoneSpeech01|Fury 2 About Tisiphone Speech 01|Zagreus|Oh, don't fret. I was just trying to help her expand her somewhat limited vocabulary.
Fury2AboutTisiphoneSpeech01|Fury 2 About Tisiphone Speech 01|Alecto|Stay out of her head!! You really think she's got something to learn from you? Learn to shut up from her!
Fury2AboutMegaeraRelationship01|Fury 2 About Megaera Relationship 01|Alecto|*Eugh*, still can't believe Megaera got mixed up with you, redblood. For all her weakness, I always thought at least she took her job here seriously. *Eh*, live and learn!
Fury2AboutMegaeraRelationship01|Fury 2 About Megaera Relationship 01|Zagreus|Not interested in your nasty remarks about her, Alecto. Though if you keep them up, I'm warning you, I might get mad.
Fury2AboutMegaeraRelationship01|Fury 2 About Megaera Relationship 01|Alecto|*Ohh*, you might get *mad*? Defend Megaera's honor, since she's far too weak to do it her damn self? You think she's so pure! *Hahaha*! You're disgusting! Both of you.
Fury2WinStreak01|Fury 2 Win Streak 01|Alecto|Oh hey, redblood! You're back for more. I like that stubborn stupidness about you, honestly. If only I could keep you alive even longer this time.
Fury2WinStreak01|Fury 2 Win Streak 01|Zagreus|What, you planning to kill me with insults this time?
Fury2WinStreak01|Fury 2 Win Streak 01|Alecto|Haven't decided how just yet. This girl likes a little spontaneity.
Fury2WinStreak02|Fury 2 Win Streak 02|Alecto|*Huh*! Normally my marks don't make a habit of seeking me out again after I'm through with them.
Fury2WinStreak02|Fury 2 Win Streak 02|Zagreus|I can imagine that, it's just, I've really come to appreciate these little back-and-forth exchanges that we have.
Fury2WinStreak02|Fury 2 Win Streak 02|Alecto|*Ugh*, I do so hate to let you down like this, redblood. But you're just not my type. Maybe I'll finally get it through your head this time.
Fury2LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Lose Streak 01|Alecto|Know something, redblood? Try as I might, I still have not forgiven you for beating me last time. Call it a crippling character flaw, I don't know...
Fury2LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Lose Streak 01|Zagreus|Forgiveness can take time. Though self-reflection is a healthy step. We're making progress!
Fury2LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Lose Streak 01|Alecto|You think we're making progress? Here? *Ah, hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, *why you piece of trash! I'll show you progress.
Fury2LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Lose Streak 02|Alecto|Redblood, I'm getting awful sick of seeing your smug face, time, after time, after time.
Fury2LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Lose Streak 02|Zagreus|Have you given any thought to just... leaving me alone, and going back to wherever it is you came from?
Fury2LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Lose Streak 02|Alecto|You see? That is *exactly *what I mean. To think that Megaera had to put up with you for, I don't know how long.
Fury2LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Damn you for this, redblood. You're making me look bad, you know? Making me *feel *bad.
Fury2LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Lose Streak 03|Zagreus|Alecto, I didn't ask you to repeatedly attempt to kill me. How did you expect me to respond?
Fury2LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Lose Streak 03|Alecto|*Ah-hahah-hahaha, hahah*, you do know what happens when you make me *feel *bad, don't you...?
Fury2LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Lose Streak 04|Alecto|*Huh*, it's the god of trash, come once again to filthy up this place! You're getting real predictable, you know.
Fury2LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Lose Streak 04|Zagreus|Considering I beat you last we met, I'd be much more concerned with your predictability than mine.
Fury2LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Lose Streak 04|Alecto|Don't want to hear it from you, trash! Just want to see you bleed. Now you come here!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable01|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 01|Alecto|*Ohh*, there he is, sisters. It's time to get to work.
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable03|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 03|Alecto|Let's tear him into shreds, sisters, come on!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable04|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 04|Alecto|Hey, check it out, sisters, he's back. You ready?
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable05|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 05|Alecto|He's come crawling back again, sisters. Let's get him, then.
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable06|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 06|Alecto|All right, sisters! Don't screw this up for me!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable07|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 07|Alecto|I'm taking point against this trash, sisters. You back me up.
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable08|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 08|Alecto|All three of us against *this *trash, sisters? All right!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable09|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 09|Alecto|The three Furies up against the trash god! What a fight!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable09|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 09|Alecto|Oh, *hohohohoho*, look at him, sisters! Don't you just want to whip him all to shreds?!
Fury2SistersUnionRepeatable10|Fury 2 Sisters Union Repeatable 10|Alecto|Much as I love chatting with you, Meg, Tisiphone... our prey is here.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable01|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 01|Alecto|You ready, Sis? This redblood's nothing to the both of us.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable03|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 03|Alecto|Well, Sis, what do you say we get started on him?
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable04|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 04|Alecto|There he is, Sis! I'm ready if you're ready.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable05|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 05|Alecto|All right, Sister! Let's rip him all to shreds!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable06|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 06|Alecto|You ready for him, Sister? I most definitely am!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable07|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 07|Alecto|You're never getting through the both of us without losing a lot of blood, trash god.
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable08|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 08|Alecto|My sis and I, we're going to tear you limb from limb, redblood!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable09|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 09|Alecto|Think you can scoot right past the both of us, trash god?!
Fury2SisterUnionRepeatable10|Fury 2 Sister Union Repeatable 10|Alecto|All right, Sis! You just back me up against this trash!
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 01|Alecto|I'll just keep killing you, redblood. Not that I mind!
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 02|Alecto|What are we going to do with you this time, now, hm?
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 03|Alecto|I'm impressed, redblood. You really never learn.
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 04|Alecto|Turns out, killing the god of trash never gets old.
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak05|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 05|Alecto|How would you like to die this time, redblood? Here, let me guess.
Fury2MiscStartWinStreak06|Fury 2 Misc Start Win Streak 06|Alecto|You just don't get it, do you? Though I bet I can make you learn.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 01|Alecto|I'm getting real sick of you, trash god. Come on!
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 02|Alecto|Bad news for you, redblood. I like dying.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Come on, redblood, let's see you kill me again!
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 04|Alecto|You're stuck with me forever, trash. Remember that.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak05|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 05|Alecto|I'm really starting to hate you. You know that, redblood?
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak06|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 06|Alecto|Why if it isn't the god of trash himself. I'm so honored.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak07|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 07|Alecto|Good news for you, I'm in a real bad mood right now.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak08|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 08|Alecto|Been looking forward to this chance to get you back, redblood.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak09|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 09|Alecto|Heard you were in the area, and thought I'd take another stab at killing you.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak10|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 10|Alecto|Redblood, I really don't appreciate what happened here last time.
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak11|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 11|Alecto|You might get through me, trash god, but I'm going to spill your blood before you do!
Fury2MiscStartLoseStreak12|Fury 2 Misc Start Lose Streak 12|Alecto|Long as I slow you down, redblood, I've done my job.
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 01|Alecto|You think just 'cause you got through Megaera, you'll get through me?
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 02|Alecto|Your daddy never should have given Megaera this job.
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Megaera couldn't make it, redblood, so it's me and you.
Fury2MiscStartVsFuryLoseStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury Lose Streak 04|Alecto|*Hah*! It's Megaera's hot mess. Let's clean you up.
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak01|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 01|Alecto|You got Tisiphone, so what. Now I'll get you.
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak02|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 02|Alecto|You mess with Tis, redblood, you mess with me, get it?
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak03|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 03|Alecto|Tisiphone's been having problems with you, huh. Let's see if I can help.
Fury2MiscStartVsFury3LoseStreak04|Fury 2 Misc Start Vs Fury 3 Lose Streak 04|Alecto|Nobody messes with Tisiphone but me, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart01|Fury 2 Misc Start 01|Alecto|I'm going to enjoy this, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart02|Fury 2 Misc Start 02|Alecto|Just when I was beginning to feel bored.
Fury2MiscStart03|Fury 2 Misc Start 03|Alecto|I'm going to tear you limb from limb, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart04|Fury 2 Misc Start 04|Alecto|The Fates must want to spill your blood as much as I do.
Fury2MiscStart05|Fury 2 Misc Start 05|Alecto|Time to die, again, redblood. Let's get to killing you.
Fury2MiscStart06|Fury 2 Misc Start 06|Alecto|This job never gets old, redblood, I can assure you that.
Fury2MiscStart07|Fury 2 Misc Start 07|Alecto|Well if it isn't the god of trash himself. Come die.
Fury2MiscStart08|Fury 2 Misc Start 08|Alecto|Good, I was getting real tired waiting around to kill you.
Fury2MiscStart09|Fury 2 Misc Start 09|Alecto|*Aww*, you came back all this way! I'm flattered, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart10|Fury 2 Misc Start 10|Alecto|Got some kind of deathwish, don't you. Fine.
Fury2MiscStart11|Fury 2 Misc Start 11|Alecto|Oh, thank the Fates I get to deal with you this time.
Fury2MiscStart12|Fury 2 Misc Start 12|Alecto|Let's see what you can do, redblood. Come on!
Fury2MiscStart13A|Fury 2 Misc Start 13 A|Alecto|Well! Look who's back. The god of trash, himself.
Fury2MiscStart13|Fury 2 Misc Start 13|Alecto|Get ready for a bunch of pain and suffering, trash god.
Fury2MiscStart14|Fury 2 Misc Start 14|Alecto|Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it right there, redblood.
Fury2MiscStart15|Fury 2 Misc Start 15|Alecto|Been waiting here to beat you to a bloody pulp, redblood!
Fury2MiscStart16|Fury 2 Misc Start 16|Alecto|Don't even open that damn mouth of yours, redblood. Except to scream.
Fury2MiscStart17|Fury 2 Misc Start 17|Alecto|You must like pain, or something, don't you, there, redblood?
Fury2MiscStart18|Fury 2 Misc Start 18|Alecto|Somebody's dying soon, redblood! *Ohh*, I can't wait.
Fury2MiscStart19|Fury 2 Misc Start 19|Alecto|Come give me everything you've got, trash god!
Fury2MiscStart20|Fury 2 Misc Start 20|Alecto|Let's see what you're made of, trash god! Come on!
Fury2MiscStart21|Fury 2 Misc Start 21|Alecto|Looks like my prayers to the god of trash have finally been answered, huh?!
Fury2MiscStart22|Fury 2 Misc Start 22|Alecto|What's the matter, there, redblood? Gone awful quiet! Did I hurt your feelings, *huh*?
Fury2MiscStart23|Fury 2 Misc Start 23|Alecto|*Ohh*, I'm going to bleed you till you're dry.
Fury2MiscStart24|Fury 2 Misc Start 24|Alecto|You want to mess with me *again*, redblood?! Well then, *come on*!
Fury2MiscStart25|Fury 2 Misc Start 25|Alecto|How is it possible I am so sick of you, but never sick of *killing *you, redblood?
Fury2MiscStart26|Fury 2 Misc Start 26|Alecto|Step on it, redblood! I've got lots of other trash to whip, you know!
Fury2MiscStart27|Fury 2 Misc Start 27|Alecto|You want through that door back there, it's going to cost you blood!
Fury2MiscStart28|Fury 2 Misc Start 28|Alecto|Megaera's not just weak, she's got bad taste to match.
