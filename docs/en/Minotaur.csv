TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 03 A|Theseus|...I'm telling you, you're {#DialogueItalicFormat}wrong{#PreviousFormat}, Asterius! He is no {#DialogueItalicFormat}royalty{#PreviousFormat}, most certainly not any {#DialogueItalicFormat}I {#PreviousFormat}would recognize! He's but a nameless, long-forgotten minor god born of the depths, and bound to stay in them!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 03 A|Minotaur|I, too, once was berated by such words, king. We've faced this enemy how many times? And in my estimation, he's fought bravely, here.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 03 A|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Bravely{#PreviousFormat}?! Hiding behind those pillars is what you call {#DialogueItalicFormat}bravely{#PreviousFormat}, Asterius? We shall have to discuss this strange lapse of judgment after we achieve our victory!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A|Theseus|I hope you're perfectly pleased with yourself, hellspawn. Because Asterius has been quite cross with me! Such as he is. He says I have misjudged the likes of you! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Outrageousness{#PreviousFormat}.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A|Minotaur|You don't hear me, king. We still have a lot to learn about this foe. Each time, he's differently equipped. Weapons, god-given abilities, and such. Despite our efforts... it's been difficult to read his strategies.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A|Theseus|And now, you're saying I can't fight, Asterius? Even though I had no difficulty besting {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}within that maze of yours?! Come on, let's do this fight!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A|Theseus|Well, worm! Come fight us, I suppose. And take fullest advantage of the havoc that you sowed! We are no team! We're merely two combatants, simultaneously booked to be here, now.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A|Minotaur|King, I think you are over-reacting, here. Try to be reasonable. And be more considerate about my point of view. Don't think I am asking for too much.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A|Theseus|You're asking the impossible of me! But, let us fight. And let us lose, I'm sure, because if we are not a team, what are we, then, Asterius...?
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05Extra_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 Extra A|Minotaur|You'll have to excuse the Champion, there, short one. He hasn't been himself. Though he'll still fight you to the death, I'm sure.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05Extra_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 Extra A|Zagreus|That's good, because you had me worried for a moment, there. Hey maybe I can knock some sense back into him, what do you think?
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05Extra_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 Extra A|Minotaur|I'm not so sure. I've tried. But I know better than to underestimate you. Fight us, then.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A|Theseus|Please fight with me, again, Asterius. I mean, just like before! You must forgive me my indecencies of late. This blasted fiend! His lies and treachery get right under my skin. Or the phantasmagorical equivalent!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A|Minotaur|Swear something to me, king. That you'll discard your fears about our bond. The short one here is never going to break it. He doesn't even understand it. The only one who can break it is you, yourself.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A|Theseus|I... oh, my dear friend, Asterius. I see, of course, you're right, you're right. {#DialogueItalicFormat}You're right{#PreviousFormat}! And I solemnly do swear to you, indeed, that I shall never again doubt our brotherhood! Nor shall I ever listen to this fiend! Together, now and always!!
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Theseus|Well now, Asterius, he's returned! And this time, we shall have to vanquish him without the aid of our divine armor! A worthy challenge, no?
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Minotaur|Be cautious not to underestimate him, king. He has proved troublesome before.
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Theseus|Nonsense, my friend! For how can one underestimate that which deserves no esteem whatsoever?! Together, now, {#DialogueItalicFormat}attack{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusWithAsterius01|Theseus With Asterius 01|Minotaur|He's here, king. Activating armor. It's fortunate repairs on your chariot were completed in time.
TheseusWithAsterius01|Theseus With Asterius 01|Theseus|Nonsense, my friend! We could defeat this vile hellspawn with or without the additional divine protection we've been granted here! Get him!
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Theseus|Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Minotaur|Two against one. Seems hardly fair.... Ah, well! {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Let's kill him and be done, king.
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Zagreus|Theseus?! The Bull of Minos?! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ahh{#PreviousFormat}, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Minotaur|I warned you, short one. Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only other foe whom I have ever faced, who bested me.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Theseus|Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Zagreus|Theseus?! No way! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ahh{#PreviousFormat}, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Minotaur|Beware, short one. Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only foe whom I have ever faced, who bested me.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Theseus|Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Zagreus|Theseus?! No way! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ahh{#PreviousFormat}, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Theseus|What are those bestial gloves of yours, blackguard? Beginning to show more of your true and savage nature, here perhaps?
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|No. He bears the Twin Fists in the aspect of a king called Gilgamesh. That king, he, too, wrestled a beastlike man, who then became a friend. Maybe that's why I knew this fight would come.
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Theseus|What are you telling me, Asterius? Now is certainly not a good time for waxing philosophical, I think! And, surely this King Gilgamesh of whom you speak is much more competent a fighter than {#DialogueItalicFormat}this {#PreviousFormat}filth!
TheseusWithAsterius02|Theseus With Asterius 02|Minotaur|We're well-equipped to deal with you, short one. Though I know better than to disregard your might.
TheseusWithAsterius02|Theseus With Asterius 02|Theseus|Speak for yourself, Asterius! I, for one, know only pure contempt for this foul daemon and his underhanded fighting style! A style we shall easily dismantle, now!
TheseusWithAsterius03|Theseus With Asterius 03|Theseus|What hope have you, monster, versus the blessed bonds of brotherhood?
TheseusWithAsterius03|Theseus With Asterius 03|Minotaur|Best not belittle him, king. He is more powerful than he appears. We must remain alert, this time.
TheseusWithAsterius03|Theseus With Asterius 03|Theseus|Oh, I am perfectly alert right now, Asterius! And were I still alive, I would be positively salivating at the thought of running through this pustule with my spear, or whichever means I had available! Now, {#DialogueItalicFormat}let's go{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusWithAsterius04|Theseus With Asterius 04|Zagreus|Theseus, before you flap your ghostly gums at me again, I'd like to hear from good Asterius this time! He almost never gets a word in, thanks to you.
TheseusWithAsterius04|Theseus With Asterius 04|Minotaur|The king speaks for the both of us, short one. Though if you wish to hear me say something to you, I will oblige.
TheseusWithAsterius04|Theseus With Asterius 04|Theseus|And I, too, shall oblige! That is, oblige my trusty spear, which yearns to penetrate your soft and vulnerable, altogether pallid flesh! Now, die!
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Theseus|Why, look, Asterius! It seems the fiend has brought some sort of nondescript yarn-ball! Not seen the likes of it. Indeed, it holds no sway on me, at all!
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Minotaur|King. The princess Ariadne was my sister, if you don't recall. Please do not denigrate her memory. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}You're making me upset.
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}, no, my friend! I meant you no offense! But I'd no love for her, was that my fault?! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Pff{#PreviousFormat}, forgive me. I... I shall seek her out. Someday or night. But first!! This daemon {#DialogueItalicFormat}has {#PreviousFormat}to be destroyed. Together, no?!
TheseusMiscStartWithGilgameshAspect01|Theseus Misc Start With Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|There, king! He has the weapons I told you about... the fists of Gilgamesh. Follow my lead this time.
TheseusMiscStart23_A|Theseus Misc Start 23 A|Minotaur|You face the Champion, and me. Ready yourself.
TheseusMiscStart24_A|Theseus Misc Start 24 A|Minotaur|Let us destroy him quickly, king. Or, perhaps slowly.
TheseusMiscStart25_A|Theseus Misc Start 25 A|Minotaur|Waste not more words with this one, king. Let's fight.
TheseusMiscStart26_A|Theseus Misc Start 26 A|Minotaur|It is as the king said. You will not leave Elysium except through us.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Extreme Measures 01|Minotaur|Observe this gleaming coat of bronze with which I am adorned, now, short one. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Your doing, as I'm to understand.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|My father is to thank for that, not me. I've proven difficult for him to contain, so now I'm beneficiary of his latest Pact of Punishment. You're welcome!
MinotaurExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Extreme Measures 01|Minotaur|I hadn't thanked you, as of yet. Though, come. I'll repay you suitably for having me encased within this... suit.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Extreme Measures 02|Minotaur|Tell me, short one, where is your own armored suit? I would prefer not to do battle against one who's ill equipped.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Extreme Measures 02|Zagreus|You know, my father keeps the dress code very strict down there in Tartarus. No armor in the House! Never tried the stuff.
MinotaurExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Extreme Measures 02|Minotaur|Dress code. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}I, too, follow a code. And it's a code that strictly states I cannot let you pass without a fight.
MinotaurExtremeMeasuresWinStreak01|Minotaur Extreme Measures Win Streak 01|Minotaur|Even with this armor I was unable to best you one-to-one. Perhaps I lack as yet the necessary training to take full advantage of its benefit.
MinotaurExtremeMeasuresWinStreak01|Minotaur Extreme Measures Win Streak 01|Zagreus|I don't suppose you have some good acquaintances with whom to train, until such time as you see fit to face me once again?
MinotaurExtremeMeasuresWinStreak01|Minotaur Extreme Measures Win Streak 01|Minotaur|No. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}King Theseus is occupied with preparations of his own. You are my good acquaintance now.
MinotaurPactReverted01|Minotaur Pact Reverted 01|Minotaur|I am returned once more to my more-earthly capability, short one. And I am able to move freely once again.
MinotaurPactReverted01|Minotaur Pact Reverted 01|Zagreus|Fine change of pace, Asterius! Who needs that old, spectacular, custom-fitting suit of legendary armor, anyway?
MinotaurPactReverted01|Minotaur Pact Reverted 01|Minotaur|You mock me. Yet you know nothing of being trapped; enclosed in something and unable to break free. I need no armor to fight you.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|You haven't spoken to your fist-weapons yet, have you, short one? {#DialogueItalicFormat}'I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death.' {#PreviousFormat}That's what you're supposed to tell them. I'm sure of it.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|Just been a little tied up lately is all, but I will get to it, Asterius! I guess you'll want to know the result?
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|Yes. Here, I'll give you this chance to get home quickly, if you want to know, yourself.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect02|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 02|Minotaur|There, on your hands... the weapons you call Malphon. They're just as I saw in my dream. Monstrous. Like me.
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect02|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 02|Zagreus|Former property of someone called Gilgamesh. The beast-man he fought, Enkidu... you said they became friends? What said your dream about us on that front, sir?
MinotaurAboutGilgameshAspect02|Minotaur About Gilgamesh Aspect 02|Minotaur|It didn't say much. Only that we would fight. Just as that Gilgamesh and Enkidu once did. Maybe the outcome will be the same, maybe it won't. We'll find out.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Minotaur|You come from the bowels of hell. This is not your place.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Zagreus|Agreed on both counts! Just passing through, so if you'll excuse me...
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Minotaur|I will not. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}The Champion of Elysium would never back down from such a contest. Neither will I.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Zagreus|Wait, {#DialogueItalicFormat}you're {#PreviousFormat}not the Champion of Elysium...? You're the Bull of Minos! I can't imagine who's even stronger than you. Is it Heracles? Tell me it's Heracles.
MinotaurFirstAppearance_NotMetTheseus|Minotaur First Appearance Not Met Theseus|Minotaur|I will not. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}You talk too much, short one. Come get destroyed.
MinotaurMetTheseus01|Minotaur Met Theseus 01|Minotaur|You have met the Champion, the king. Let us see if you are fit to face him once again.
MinotaurMetTheseus01|Minotaur Met Theseus 01|Zagreus|You mean face both of you, together. Which doesn't seem particularly fair.
MinotaurMetTheseus01|Minotaur Met Theseus 01|Minotaur|Life isn't particularly fair, short one. Nor death. I'd have expected you to know as much. But here, have your fair fight.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Minotaur|Let us clash here again before you face the Champion. We never will allow you through without a fight.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Zagreus|You're nothing like Theseus. Why go along with everything he says and does? You're your own man. And bull.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Minotaur|King Theseus slew me in life, and saved me in death. I was cast into Erebus. A monster. He found me when he died. And used his influence to bring me here, with him.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Zagreus|That's nice of him and all, but sounds like you're even to me. Seeing as he killed you in the first place.
MinotaurMetTheseus02|Minotaur Met Theseus 02|Minotaur|No; we're not. And I will fight for him, and alongside him, for eternity. As recompense for helping me to understand exactly who I am.
MinotaurDefeatedTheseus01|Minotaur Defeated Theseus 01|Minotaur|You bested the Champion, himself. Which means that I have little hope of vanquishing you, here.
MinotaurDefeatedTheseus01|Minotaur Defeated Theseus 01|Zagreus|So then, why bother fighting me? You don't have to do this. That Theseus is a highly questionable influence on you!
MinotaurDefeatedTheseus01|Minotaur Defeated Theseus 01|Minotaur|I see you plain, short one. I, too, was born of darkness. But, I chose the path of light. Even in death, it was not too late. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Not even for a monster, such as I. I trust your deaths will likewise be enlightening.
MinotaurPactHighHeatReaction01|Minotaur Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Minotaur|This heat... it reminds me of when I was young. Living in darkness. Learning to fight. To kill.
MinotaurPactHighHeatReaction01|Minotaur Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Zagreus|I suppose you're about to put that learning to practice in another moment here?
MinotaurPactHighHeatReaction01|Minotaur Pact High Heat Reaction 01|Minotaur|I am. The heat fills me with strength. Let's see if it has any effect on you.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}. I sense another furious battle here awaits us, short one. Although you're more inquisitive than usual...
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Zagreus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Uhh{#PreviousFormat}, oh! It's just, I have an odd request. You see, the god of slumber, Hypnos? Colleague of mine. Huge fan. He's in desperate need of your autograph. Little personalized message? I don't suppose you'd be so kind. It'd mean a lot to him.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|Autograph. I see. Then, it appears there are such gods as favor me. I will inscribe a bit of parchment for your colleague, then.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Storyteller|{#DialogueItalicFormat}The god-forsaken Minotaur impresses then upon a parchment a brief message to the god of sleep, and gives it to the favor-asking Prince.
MinotaurAutograph01|Minotaur Autograph 01|Minotaur|Know, short one, that this favor is for you and not for Hypnos. Though he may challenge me himself, at any time.
MinotaurAboutFistWeapon01|Minotaur About Fist Weapon 01|Minotaur|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Huh{#PreviousFormat}. You mean to fight with me bare-handed this time, short one? I'm not ashamed to say the Champion himself defeated me in such a manner back when we drew breath.
MinotaurAboutFistWeapon01|Minotaur About Fist Weapon 01|Zagreus|Wouldn't say the Twin Fists of Malphon counts as empty-handed, sir, though it surprises me to hear you could be beaten in such a way.
MinotaurAboutFistWeapon01|Minotaur About Fist Weapon 01|Minotaur|I was hungry and unprepared. Inexperienced. No longer. Come.
MinotaurAboutFriendship01|Minotaur About Friendship 01|Minotaur|You must take pleasure in having to fight against me, short one. I, too, have come to look forward to it. Even if I end up falling to your strength.
MinotaurAboutFriendship01|Minotaur About Friendship 01|Zagreus|Oh, I was going to say, I'd much prefer we settle this more amicably, couldn't we? Perhaps I could interest you in a fine bottle of Nectar? Ambrosia, even?
MinotaurAboutFriendship01|Minotaur About Friendship 01|Minotaur|No, thank you. These battles are enough. Besides... you won that Ambrosia from us, fair and square.
MinotaurAboutFriendship02|Minotaur About Friendship 02|Minotaur|Well, you're back, short one. Or Prince. Whatever they call you. I'm not much for formality.
MinotaurAboutFriendship02|Minotaur About Friendship 02|Zagreus|Not much for it either, here, Asterius. Though, speaking of which, how would you prefer to be addressed? The Minotaur, the Bull of Minos? Those aren't offensive to you, are they?
MinotaurAboutFriendship02|Minotaur About Friendship 02|Minotaur|They don't mean anything to me. They mean something to others. I have my name. You know it. Use it if you want. Now, enough.
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Zagreus|Say, you're from Crete, originally, aren't you, Asterius? I know this is a stretch, but... I don't suppose you ever heard of a commander by the name of {#DialogueItalicFormat}Schelemeus{#PreviousFormat}? Captain of the Cretan second fleet, something like that?
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Minotaur|The king of Crete commanded the greatest navy in the world. Even I knew that, having never seen the light of day, the ships, the sea. {#DialogueItalicFormat}Schelemeus{#PreviousFormat}, huh...? I might have heard the name. So what?
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Zagreus|What, Schelemeus was a real person, then? But, Skelly said... ah, you know what, it's nothing, Asterius. Shall we?
MinotaurAboutSkelly01|Minotaur About Skelly 01|Minotaur|Yes. Let's.
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|You've come, short one. I dreamed of this very moment.
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|Come on, Asterius, we've fought how many times already? What's there to dream about?
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|No. I dreamed. And in my dream, there was something I had to tell you. Rather... something you have to tell the weapons you wear on your hands. Tell them, {#DialogueItalicFormat}'I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death.'{#PreviousFormat}
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Zagreus|Hey, I know what that is, that's a waking-phrase. So I'm to speak it to Malphon. Wait, why are you helping me?
MinotaurRevealsGilgameshAspect01|Minotaur Reveals Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|I don't know whether I'm helping you or not. But in my dream... an ancient hero fought a beast of a man, barehanded. They became friends, in the end, after a great battle. I long for a fight like that.
MinotaurClearProgress01|Minotaur Clear Progress 01|Minotaur|I wonder something, short one. You keep coming back. But I don't know why. You're trying to get out of here, aren't you? But something's killing you up there.
MinotaurClearProgress01|Minotaur Clear Progress 01|Zagreus|You've deduced more or less correctly, Asterius. And yes, let's say there are some challenges remaining once I get out of Elysium. Though I'd best say no more of it than that.
MinotaurClearProgress01|Minotaur Clear Progress 01|Minotaur|That's fine. It's good to know you've fallen just as often as I have. I may not be the one to kill you. But I'll soften you up for whoever does.
MinotaurClearProgress01_B|Minotaur Clear Progress 01 B|Minotaur|You ever make it out of here, short one? I wonder, sometimes, what it must be like... the outside.
MinotaurClearProgress01_B|Minotaur Clear Progress 01 B|Zagreus|You've never been outside? Oh, right... the labyrinth thing. You lived in a horrible maze all your life. I haven't seen much of the surface, but... it's beautiful. Cold. When I'm there, though, I... feel out of place.
MinotaurClearProgress01_B|Minotaur Clear Progress 01 B|Minotaur|Out of place. I understand, I think. I don't see why you'd want to go somewhere like that. It can't live up to the stories. Why ruin it? Speaking of which...
MinotaurPostEpilogue01|Minotaur Post Epilogue 01|Minotaur|Everyone's saying that the Queen is back. Do you know what that means, short one?
MinotaurPostEpilogue01|Minotaur Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Well, for me, at least, it happens to mean quite a bit. I'm her son!
MinotaurPostEpilogue01|Minotaur Post Epilogue 01|Minotaur|It doesn't mean a thing. We're still here to fight. Though, for what it's worth... my mother also was a queen. May yours treat you better than she treated me. Better than I'm about to treat you, here.
MinotaurLowHealth01|Minotaur Low Health 01|Minotaur|I smell the blood on you, short one. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}You are severely wounded. This will not be a fair fight.
MinotaurLowHealth01|Minotaur Low Health 01|Zagreus|An unfair fight is not worth having, then, wouldn't you say?
MinotaurLowHealth01|Minotaur Low Health 01|Minotaur|I would not. An unfair fight is better than no fight at all.
MinotaurLowHealth02|Minotaur Low Health 02|Minotaur|You're hardly in a state to fight against me, here. Won't take too long to bring you death.
MinotaurLowHealth02|Minotaur Low Health 02|Zagreus|Great! Thanks for the encouragement, Asterius. Don't let me keep you waiting on that, then.
MinotaurLowHealth02|Minotaur Low Health 02|Minotaur|If mere words can sap your will for battle, short one, then know this: You never stood a chance.
MinotaurLowHealth03|Minotaur Low Health 03|Minotaur|You look as though you withstood many foes in getting here this time. Barely withstood, that is.
MinotaurLowHealth03|Minotaur Low Health 03|Zagreus|They took a lot out of me, yes. But you have no idea just how long and arduous a trip it is from Tartarus to here!
MinotaurLowHealth03|Minotaur Low Health 03|Minotaur|What would you know of arduous? Try living in an ever-shifting maze of countless passageways. Now let me finish what your foes began.
MinotaurEncounter01|Minotaur Encounter 01|Minotaur|We meet again, short one. For further battle.
MinotaurEncounter01|Minotaur Encounter 01|Zagreus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Short one{#PreviousFormat}?! That's a low blow, sir. I thought you were the big-honorable type.
MinotaurEncounter01|Minotaur Encounter 01|Minotaur|You mock my sense of honor. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Common tactic. Now prepare.
MinotaurEncounter02|Minotaur Encounter 02|Minotaur|You choose to challenge me again. Not many in Elysium so dare. Then, I accept.
MinotaurEncounter02|Minotaur Encounter 02|Zagreus|Wait, I never challenged you! The entrance to your chamber looks like any other pathway in Elysium. I have no quarrel with you, sir!
MinotaurEncounter02|Minotaur Encounter 02|Minotaur|To step into my chamber is to challenge me. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}It is a custom since the time I lived and breathed in darkness. I will send you into such a darkness now.
MinotaurEncounter03|Minotaur Encounter 03|Minotaur|My next opponent has arrived in short order.
MinotaurEncounter03|Minotaur Encounter 03|Zagreus|Short order? That was another jab about my height, wasn't it!
MinotaurEncounter03|Minotaur Encounter 03|Minotaur|I do not jab. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}All of my strength goes into every strike. Observe.
MinotaurEncounter04|Minotaur Encounter 04|Minotaur|You have returned to my chamber. I trust you are familiar now with what this means.
MinotaurEncounter04|Minotaur Encounter 04|Zagreus|It means I've challenged you to a battle of strength and glory, because apparently that's all there is to do for fun around here for those such as yourself?
MinotaurEncounter04|Minotaur Encounter 04|Minotaur|That... {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Yes. Essentially that is correct. Prepare.
MinotaurEncounter05|Minotaur Encounter 05|Minotaur|It would seem {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}that the time for additional {#DialogueItalicFormat}fun {#PreviousFormat}has arrived.
MinotaurEncounter05|Minotaur Encounter 05|Zagreus|Ah, yes, my favorite pastime: Getting butchered by a giant double-bladed axe. And sometimes trampled.
MinotaurEncounter05|Minotaur Encounter 05|Minotaur|Then, good. You have much to enjoy in store.
MinotaurEncounter06|Minotaur Encounter 06|Minotaur|Well, short one. It seems I must attempt to maim you here, so that the king and I might finally stop you at the gates.
MinotaurEncounter06|Minotaur Encounter 06|Zagreus|You know, you hurt me with this '{#DialogueItalicFormat}short one{#PreviousFormat}' business almost as much as with that axe. Why isn't Theseus '{#DialogueItalicFormat}short one{#PreviousFormat}'? We're the same height!
MinotaurEncounter06|Minotaur Encounter 06|Minotaur|No. The king is greater. He is the greatest king of Athens! What are you? A willful son of a fickle god. I am beneath your father's notice. And you are beneath the king's. Now fight me.
MinotaurWinStreak01|Minotaur Win Streak 01|Minotaur|It is not often that my challengers return to face another slaughter at my hands.
MinotaurWinStreak01|Minotaur Win Streak 01|Zagreus|Yeah, well. You're kind of in my way. What choice do I have?
MinotaurWinStreak01|Minotaur Win Streak 01|Minotaur|Your choices led you here, and they will lead you to defeat, again.
MinotaurLoseStreak01|Minotaur Lose Streak 01|Minotaur|You are more skilled than I expected, short one. A re-match is most certainly in order.
MinotaurLoseStreak01|Minotaur Lose Streak 01|Zagreus|You're going to force a rematch each time I manage to defeat you, aren't you?
MinotaurLoseStreak01|Minotaur Lose Streak 01|Minotaur|We and our victories are all impermanent here in Elysium. We live, such as it is, for moments such as these.
MinotaurMiscStart01|Minotaur Misc Start 01|Minotaur|Your challenge is hereby accepted, short one.
MinotaurMiscStart02|Minotaur Misc Start 02|Minotaur|Another challenger. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Come get destroyed.
MinotaurMiscStart03|Minotaur Misc Start 03|Minotaur|I accept all challengers. No prior notice necessary.
MinotaurMiscStart04|Minotaur Misc Start 04|Minotaur|You have returned. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}I'm always ready to oppose you.
MinotaurMiscStart05|Minotaur Misc Start 05|Minotaur|You enter my chamber once again, short one. Then, good.
MinotaurMiscStart06|Minotaur Misc Start 06|Minotaur|I expected you to reappear. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Let us fight.
MinotaurMiscStart07|Minotaur Misc Start 07|Minotaur|Appears it's time we challenged one another once again. Prepare.
MinotaurMiscStart08|Minotaur Misc Start 08|Minotaur|Good. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}It feels as though I haven't crushed the life from anything in ages.
MinotaurMiscStart09|Minotaur Misc Start 09|Minotaur|Returned to battle me for glory, short one? {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Excellent.
MinotaurMiscStart10|Minotaur Misc Start 10|Minotaur|Come fight me again, short one. We have eternity to grow stronger.
MinotaurMiscStart11|Minotaur Misc Start 11|Minotaur|Thank you, short one. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Few in Elysium dare challenge me repeatedly.
MinotaurMiscStart12|Minotaur Misc Start 12|Minotaur|The short one from the bowels of hell has finally returned.
MinotaurMiscStart13|Minotaur Misc Start 13|Minotaur|I heard you had again entered Elysium. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}At last.
MinotaurMiscStart14|Minotaur Misc Start 14|Minotaur|Hold nothing back against me, short one. Now, come.
MinotaurMiscStart15|Minotaur Misc Start 15|Minotaur|Let us grow stronger in the ways of battle, short one.
MinotaurMiscStart16|Minotaur Misc Start 16|Minotaur|I always am prepared to fight whoever dares oppose me.
MinotaurMiscStart17|Minotaur Misc Start 17|Minotaur|Let us battle now before you face the Champion, himself.
MinotaurMiscStart19|Minotaur Misc Start 19|Minotaur|You seek the Champion. You must confront me, first.
MinotaurMiscStart20|Minotaur Misc Start 20|Minotaur|Hrmm. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}It has been long enough since my last fight.
MinotaurMiscStart21|Minotaur Misc Start 21|Minotaur|I've been waiting for another round against you. Let's go. Now.
MinotaurMiscStart22|Minotaur Misc Start 22|Minotaur|They said you were headed this way. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}I said I'd stop you. Though, we'll see.
MinotaurMiscStart23|Minotaur Misc Start 23|Minotaur|Each time we fight... I think I learn a little more. Let's start.
MinotaurMiscStart24|Minotaur Misc Start 24|Minotaur|I had a feeling you would cross my path again. I've been looking forward to this.
MinotaurMiscStart25|Minotaur Misc Start 25|Minotaur|I'm going to run you down, or run you through. Your choice, short one.
MinotaurMiscStart26|Minotaur Misc Start 26|Minotaur|Told the king I'd try to stop you on the way. He thought I'd have no trouble. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}We'll see.
MinotaurMiscStart27|Minotaur Misc Start 27|Minotaur|Come on, short one. I've been waiting too long for this.
MinotaurMiscStart28|Minotaur Misc Start 28|Minotaur|You know what it takes to leave this chamber alive, short one. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Come on and fight.
MinotaurMiscStartExtremeMeasures01|Minotaur Misc Start Extreme Measures 01|Minotaur|I have my armor, short one. Let's see what you have.
MinotaurMiscStartExtremeMeasures02|Minotaur Misc Start Extreme Measures 02|Minotaur|Let's see if you can cut through my coat this time.
MinotaurMiscStartExtremeMeasures03|Minotaur Misc Start Extreme Measures 03|Minotaur|This armor's heavy. But makes me even faster than before. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Watch.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak01|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 01|Minotaur|You are resilient, short one, I will give you that.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak02|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 02|Minotaur|I'm prepared to slaughter you again, short one. Come fight.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak03|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 03|Minotaur|Interesting. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Most never challenge me again once I destroy them.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak04|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 04|Minotaur|What hope have you against the Champion, if you can't get through me?
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak05|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 05|Minotaur|You have tenacity, short one. I have to give you that.
MinotaurMiscStartWinStreak06|Minotaur Misc Start Win Streak 06|Minotaur|You do not take all your defeats to heart, do you? That's good.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak01|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 01|Minotaur|You're quick, short one. Let's see if you can get past me again.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak02|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 02|Minotaur|Well, short one. I'm curious to see if you can best me once again.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak03|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 03|Minotaur|A worthy challenger returns. Let's see you defeat me again.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak04|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 04|Minotaur|Glory and honor to you if you can vanquish me again. Come!
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak05|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 05|Minotaur|I welcome the taste of defeat, short one. It is akin to feeling alive.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak06|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 06|Minotaur|I'm still learning all your tricks, short one. Come show me more.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak07|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 07|Minotaur|Let's see you get through me again, short one.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak08|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 08|Minotaur|I'm the one to challenge {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}this time, short one.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak09|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 09|Minotaur|I have looked forward to repaying you in kind for our last fight.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak10|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 10|Minotaur|You're strong, short one. But I am just as obstinate as you.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak11|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 11|Minotaur|The Champion awaits, short one. If you can get through me again, that is.
MinotaurMiscStartLoseStreak12|Minotaur Misc Start Lose Streak 12|Minotaur|Good. Now I can get you back for last time. All I need is one clean hit.
MinotaurOutro01|Minotaur Outro 01|Minotaur|Well fought. Though, your technique pales in comparison to that of the Champion of Elysium. I expect you'll soon see for yourself.
MinotaurOutro02|Minotaur Outro 02|Minotaur|I respect your strength, short one. The Champion of Elysium awaits. Until such time.
MinotaurOutro03|Minotaur Outro 03|Minotaur|You were a worthy challenger. Most welcome here. Until we meet again.
MinotaurOutro04|Minotaur Outro 04|Minotaur|You have earned your passage. I go now to recover for the next occasion that we meet.
MinotaurOutro05|Minotaur Outro 05|Minotaur|Thank you for sparring with me, short one. I'm glad we've made a habit of it thus.
MinotaurGilgameshAspectOutro01|Minotaur Gilgamesh Aspect Outro 01|Minotaur|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Urgh{#PreviousFormat}... the might of Gilgamesh... I understand it now. But I won't make his friend's mistake. We'll fight again.
MinotaurGilgameshAspectOutro02|Minotaur Gilgamesh Aspect Outro 02|Minotaur|Such strength... the strength of Gilgamesh. Thank you for the battle, short one.
