AresWithDionysus01|Duo - Ares and Dionysus (1)|Ares|Ah, my kin! I was just inquiring with Lord Dionysus here, under which circumstances are the greatest mortal feasts of all prepared? Because I have a certain hunch, regarding that...
AresWithDionysus01|Duo - Ares and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|Yeah, yeah, Ares, I will hand it to you, man. There's nothing like a feast after a war, all right! Provided you're on the surviving side, that is! Otherwise I guess they'll be feasting with *you *down there, Zag!
ArtemisWithDionysus01|Duo - Artemis and Dionysus (1)|Artemis|Oh, great, it's you, Zagreus! Here, let me offer you some fine new Boons, as well as Lord Dionysus here, who I am sure would love to talk your ear off just as much as mine!
ArtemisWithDionysus01|Duo - Artemis and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|*Eh*, tells me I'm being awful loud, and to back off, all sorts of nasty stuff like that, what can you do, though, right?
AphroditeWithDionysus01|Duo - Aphrodite and Dionysus (1)|Aphrodite|My powers, dearest, oft go hand-in-hand with those of Dionysus, with his power to persuade the mind to find such beauty where it isn't, really!
AphroditeWithDionysus01|Duo - Aphrodite and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|*Ah, haha*, no need to flatter me like that, there, Lady Aphrodite! Beauty's almost entirely within the mind, I'm sure! And in the muscles and the jawline and the winning smile and, well, who am I to tell you, yeah?
DionysusWithZeus01|Duo - Dionysus and Zeus (1)|Dionysus|Hey Zag, my Dad, he's here and wants to have a word, be cool man, go along with what he says, OK?
DionysusWithZeus01|Duo - Dionysus and Zeus (1)|Zeus|That Dionysus, always much too kind with introductions, though at least he shows me suitable respect. Perhaps someday he can instruct you in the customs of Olympus here.
DionysusWithPoseidon01|Duo - Dionysus and Poseidon (1)|Dionysus|*Uh*, Zag, *erm*... your uncle's passing through. Not Dad, *erm*, the other one I mean, and he just wanted to check in, see how you're doing, so...
DionysusWithPoseidon01|Duo - Dionysus and Poseidon (1)|Poseidon|*Ah-hah*, there you are, my little nephew! Dionysus showing you the ropes, or what? You want a real feast, though, you just stick with *me*! Now take my blessing, *go*!
DionysusWithPoseidon01|Duo - Dionysus and Poseidon (1)|Dionysus|*Oh*, anyway we're here, man, waiting up for you! We know you're going to make it, I would say eventually?
DionysusWithAthena01|Duo - Dionysus and Athena (1)|Dionysus|Hey, Zag, when you arrive, it's going to be a real scene, I'll tell you now! Even Athena here will cut loose for a bit, let down her hair, you know, put on something more comfy, yeah, it's going to be *great*!
DionysusWithAthena01|Duo - Dionysus and Athena (1)|Athena|Perhaps Lord Dionysus here is the true god of strategy, as it appears he is uncannily aware of my next move, Cousin. Although, be that as it may, I shall attempt to remain focused on your situation. Not his feast.
DionysusWithAres01|Duo - Dionysus and Ares (1)|Dionysus|You know, Zag, maybe once you get here, you could get old Ares to just lighten up a little, you know, man? Always dragging down the mood, with talk of blood, and nastiness, all sorts of stuff like that!
DionysusWithAres01|Duo - Dionysus and Ares (1)|Ares|Why, my Lord Dionysus! I fail to see why such discussion is perceived as unbecoming of a feast. A successfully conducted war is certainly a cause for celebration, is it not?
DionysusWithAphrodite01|Duo - Dionysus and Aphrodite (1)|Dionysus|Look, Zag, you should know by now that when it comes to feasting, it's Yours Truly here who puts on the best performance. But I do have Lady Aphrodite's help!
DionysusWithAphrodite01|Duo - Dionysus and Aphrodite (1)|Aphrodite|Wine does have a rather special way of making everybody look even more beautiful than ever, Dionysus dear! And from such beauty, why, long-lasting love is born! And also shorter-lasting love, much of the time.
DionysusWithArtemis01|Duo - Dionysus and Artemis (1)|Dionysus|Zag, man, I was just attempting here to get our good friend Artemis to finally make an appearance at one of my feasts, it's just... wouldn't you know, she's all preoccupied, something about a hunt?
DionysusWithArtemis01|Duo - Dionysus and Artemis (1)|Artemis|That's right, Lord Dionysus, a *hunt*! Which requires lots and lots of *total quiet*, and clear-minded focus. So, if you'll excuse me?
DionysusWithDemeter01|Duo - Dionysus and Demeter (1)|Dionysus|Hey Zag, got a favor here I mean to ask, could you maybe persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up on the whole *'not let anything grow' *thing she's been going on about?
DionysusWithDemeter01|Duo - Dionysus and Demeter (1)|Demeter|I daresay, my Lord Dionysus, that partaking of less wine for some amount of time might do you good. Regardless, you'll not coax a better crop from me.
DionysusAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Dionysus About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Zagreus|Hope this lives up to your expectations, mate. In the name of Hades! Olympus? This is an official message! Should be a good time, Lord Dionysus!
DionysusAboutOlympianReunionQuest01|Dionysus About Olympian Reunion Quest 01|Dionysus|Whoa, hold just for a moment, Zag, now, I can recognize an invite when I see one, man! And this is definitely almost certainly some sort of invite, one for me, and... one for everybody else, it looks like, here? Hoh, I'm excited, that is something really special, I can tell!
DionysusPostEpilogue01|Dionysus Post Epilogue 01|Dionysus|Look, Zag, I don't entirely recall what happened at that feast you threw for all of us down there, but let me tell you, I am under the impression it went *smashingly*! It was *amazing*, man! Let's have another one sometime, all right?
DionysusAboutZeus01|Dionysus About Zeus 01|Dionysus|So Zag, you met my dad by now, your uncle Zeus? He's cool and loves a feasting, just... be sure to keep him in your thoughts. OK?
DionysusAboutPoseidon01|Dionysus About Poseidon 01|Dionysus|*Hoh-ho*, no way Zag, looking like you got yourself a gift from old Poseidon there? He's quite the catch, but here, hope you saved some room for more!
DionysusAboutAthena01|Dionysus About Athena 01|Dionysus|Hey man, I heard Athena had a word with you already yeah? She's cool, though, once you get to know her. Here! I got something that ought to suit her style.
DionysusAboutAphrodite01|Dionysus About Aphrodite 01|Dionysus|*Whoa*, hey, you must have had a run-in with the lovely Aphrodite, am I right, or am I right, there Zag? But I have *just *the thing to go with her!
DionysusAboutArtemis01|Dionysus About Artemis 01|Dionysus|Hey, Zag, got to tell you, I cannot believe that little Artemis is hanging out with you! She doesn't hang with anybody, man! But I digress, take this!
DionysusAboutAres01|Dionysus About Ares 01|Dionysus|You hanging out with Ares, are you, Zag? He's quite the chap, I'll give him that, I'll give him that, and now, I'll give you *this*!
DionysusAboutDemeter01|Dionysus About Demeter 01|Dionysus|Felt a shiver in the air just now, and that can only mean that chilly Demeter decided to give you a little help, there, huh? Or maybe it's just cold, I mean, this is a mountaintop!
DionysusAboutHadesKeepsake01|Dionysus About Hades Keepsake 01|Dionysus|Hey, Zag, uh... I may just be losing it or something here, but isn't that your dad's own blessing that you've got? That's something, man, I didn't know that he was helping you!
DionysusPostGiftPickup01|Dionysus Post Gift Pickup 01|Dionysus|Now how's my favorite Underworld god surviving, Zag, you holding up or what? Right better momentarily, I bet!
DionysusPostGiftPickup02|Dionysus Post Gift Pickup 02|Dionysus|Man oh man, Zag, someday you will be the guest of honor at the *biggest *feast that you have *ever *seen! Though I know you have got your hands full for the time, so, first things first!
DionysusBackstory01|Dionysus Backstory 01|Dionysus|Sometimes I have to wonder, man, what's going through your head, I mean, I know you hear me and the others but it's so damn dark down there I can't hear you at all!
DionysusBackstory02|Dionysus Backstory 02|Dionysus|Let me tell you something, Zag, I know your dad he's got to be a real handful, I relate to that, you understand me, mate? So you get out of there, and you'll be more than welcome here, with us!
DionysusHighRelationship01|Dionysus High Relationship 01|Dionysus|I've got a feeling this time, man, like things are really going to take a turn for you, and I mean for the better, almost certainly, I think!
DionysusHighRelationship02|Dionysus High Relationship 02|Dionysus|The key to any halfway decent feast is lots and lots of preparation, man. Or maybe just having to improvise, you know?
DionysusRunProgress01|Dionysus Run Progress 01|Dionysus|I got to hand it to you, Zag, you don't back down, you don't ever back down, what is this, like the twentieth time that you've attempted to escape?
DionysusRunProgress02|Dionysus Run Progress 02|Dionysus|You're getting somewhere, getting somewhere, man, I understand you made it up to Asphodel before, now that is progress, keep it up, you keep on going, yeah?
DionysusRunProgress03|Dionysus Run Progress 03|Dionysus|Heard you wrestled with some Satyrs near the surface, Zag! Nice work making it that far, and I just want to let you know that they are definitely not my crew, man! Satyrs I know aren't like that at all!
DionysusRunCleared01|Dionysus Run Cleared 01|Dionysus|Ah, Zag, what *happened *last time, man? It seemed like you were rather close, but then, we couldn't see you anymore from here, and now you're back? Well, give another go!
DionysusRunCleared02|Dionysus Run Cleared 02|Dionysus|Want you to know something, here, man. It's been a bit of a long haul, but you are getting closer to the surface, and you'll get there someday, and we're with you, however long it takes, OK?
DionysusPostEpilogue02|Dionysus Post Epilogue 02|Dionysus|Hey, back when we had that feast, there, man, I, I hope I didn't, you know, make for any inconveniences or anything down there, did I...?
DionysusPostEpilogue03|Dionysus Post Epilogue 03|Dionysus|Zag, I cannot believe your mom's Persephone, that's something else, I got to tell you, man! I never took her for the sort to be all into Underworld stuff!
DionysusAboutKeepsake01|Dionysus About Keepsake 01|Dionysus|Say, isn't that the Overflowing Cup I handed down to you, I'm glad you like it, man! I guess it's overflowing still, because I figure otherwise I couldn't tell at all!
DionysusAboutNectar01|Dionysus About Nectar 01|Dionysus|You, man, must be mates with just about *everybody *down there, by now, yeah? Doling out Nectars left and right, just livening the place right up!
DionysusAboutNectar02|Dionysus About Nectar 02|Dionysus|Say, let me just point out you've got a lot of Nectar on you, man! Oh, I can tell, I like the stuff a lot, myself, but even I don't pack *that *much, and I mean, *wow*!
DionysusAboutAmbrosia01|Dionysus About Ambrosia 01|Dionysus|Say, man, if I'm not mistaken, I think you got yourself a bottle of Ambrosia, there? I'd no idea you could get that stuff downstairs! Do me a solid, though, hang on to any more you find, or better yet, give it away! I'd hate to think even a drop has gone to waste!
DionysusAboutAmbrosia02|Dionysus About Ambrosia 02|Dionysus|Well, would you just look at yourself, Zag! You are like a walking stockpile of Ambrosia, aren't you? Taking the best care of it, at that. I knew I could count on you, but... *<Sniff> *I didn't know I could be just so proud of you, you know, man?
DionysusAboutAmbrosia03|Dionysus About Ambrosia 03|Dionysus|Zag, turns out I am quite the judge of character, and you, man, have an *awful *lot of it, I mean, you've given out how much Ambrosia now? To *all *your mates, and *more*?!
DionysusAboutAmbrosia04|Dionysus About Ambrosia 04|Dionysus|You got to let me in on something, Zag, how did you gather up so much Ambrosia, there? I mean, sometimes I think the stuff is plentiful up here, but you are positively swimming in it, man!
DionysusAboutGifting01|Dionysus About Gifting 01|Dionysus|You are the talk of the mountain, you know that, man? Good on you, getting on just about everybody's good side up here, I mean, that is a feat, all right!
DionysusAboutOrpheus01|Dionysus About Orpheus 01|Dionysus|Hey Zag, ever see a fellow by the name of Orpheus down there, you ever heard of him? I bet you have, and I have had a funny thought, a little jest that maybe we could try, if you'd be up to have a little harmless fun?
DionysusAboutOrpheus01|Dionysus About Orpheus 01|Zagreus|Harmless fun at the expense of Orpheus? You have my full and complete attention, Dionysus mate.
DionysusAboutOrpheus01|Dionysus About Orpheus 01|Dionysus|...That chap comes up with the most smashing songs, so I was thinking, maybe we could spin him a tall tale, something like how maybe you and I, like, we're connected or something? He'll buy it, tell him, tell him for me, yeah?!
DionysusAboutOrpheus02|Dionysus About Orpheus 02|Dionysus|*Hahaha*, Zag! I heard you got to Orpheus, he's got this whole entire ballad now, about how you are really me, or maybe it's the other way around, I've no idea, *hahahaha*! Here!
DionysusAboutSingersReunionQuest01|Dionysus About Singers Reunion Quest 01|Dionysus|Zag, I heard that Orpheus, he found his missing bride, why, isn't that the sweetest thing, isn't it, man? I'll drink to that, and I think so should you!
DionysusVsMeg01|Dionysus Vs Meg 01|Dionysus|*Erm*, hey, man, you been having some bad run-ins with that Fury, Megaera, is that her name? Now isn't she a real firebrand! Maybe this'll help you out next time you meet!
DionysusAboutMegRelationship01|Dionysus About Meg Relationship 01|Dionysus|Whoa, Zag, heard you're hanging with the Fury Megaera of late, well cheers to that, man, bet she's something else, but you just watch for that whip of hers, OK?
DionysusAboutMegRelationship02|Dionysus About Meg Relationship 02|Dionysus|Hey man, I'm hearing up here that you got in good with Megaera, the Fury, is that right, I mean, I hope it is, because, *hahaha, yeow*, know what I mean? They say she's something else!
DionysusAboutThanRelationship01|Dionysus About Than Relationship 01|Dionysus|Hey, you're in good with Thanatos, isn't that right? A real broody sort, sometimes I think maybe I ought to just invite him to a feast, but then, what if he cools the whole thing down, makes everybody kind of *ehhhhh*, you know?
DionysusVsTheseus01|Dionysus Vs Theseus 01|Dionysus|Heard that you took care of Theseus down in Elysium of late, there, Zag! Nice work, never liked that one, between us. There's this nice lass helped him out one time, and he just dumped her rotten, I don't like that, man!
DionysusAboutYarn01|Dionysus About Yarn 01|Dionysus|Why, you've a Yarn of Ariadne, right there, Zag, I know the lass for whom that yarn is named! She was a right attractive one, we had our little time, long story, though, will save it till you get here!
DionysusLowHealth01|Dionysus Low Health 01|Dionysus|Whoaa Zag, man, you look positively knackered, you be sure and take it easy if you can out there, all right? Here, maybe this'll help!
DionysusLowHealth02|Dionysus Low Health 02|Dionysus|*Oof*, Zag, look, I know you're not in a good spot right now, you must be really out of sorts! Though maybe *this *might numb the pain a bit!
DionysusLowHealth03|Dionysus Low Health 03|Dionysus|*Eugh*, you're a proper mess right now, got to be candid with you, man, you're bleeding everywhere, get it together, yeah?

DionysusMiscPickup04|Dionysus Misc Pickup 04|Dionysus|Hey Zag, how is life, you hanging in there, yeah? I reckoned maybe we could raise a glass here, to your health, but then I thought, *'No, wait! I can do a little more than that!*' So, here we go!
DionysusMiscPickup05|Dionysus Misc Pickup 05|Dionysus|Hey, how you living life down there right now, all right I take it, yeah? No, wait, though, I have just the thing!

DionysusMiscPickup07|Dionysus Misc Pickup 07|Dionysus|How goes it this time, man, everything fine? Though hold that thought, I wager we can make things finer yet!
DionysusMiscPickup08|Dionysus Misc Pickup 08|Dionysus|That Underworld of yours, place is a real pit, isn't it Zag, a shame you're stuck down there. But we are going to get you out of there, together, you and I!

DionysusLootBought01|Dionysus Loot Bought 01|Dionysus|Heeey, what's, uh, with that Charon, man, he's sort of, *I-don't-know*, though I am glad he's been of service!
DionysusLootBought02|Dionysus Loot Bought 02|Dionysus|*Ah-hah*, you found me holing up in Charon's nasty stash there did you man, well good, good, here!
DionysusLootBought03|Dionysus Loot Bought 03|Dionysus|Looks like you are stocked for one hell of a night down there, man! I knew Charon would hook you up with what you need!
DionysusLootBought04|Dionysus Loot Bought 04|Dionysus|Hey, cheers for picking up the tab, there, Zag, now, I cannot exactly pay you back, though I could give you *this*!
DionysusLootBought05|Dionysus Loot Bought 05|Dionysus|I bet that Charon has to be the life of every feast you have down there, with such a personality, am I not right about that, man?
DionysusRejection01|Dionysus Rejection 01|Dionysus|Oh, come *on*, Zag, and here I thought that we were cool. You hurt my pride, there, man. I guess I'm going to have to hurt yours....
DionysusRejection02|Dionysus Rejection 02|Dionysus|Ohhh man, that was definitely not a thing to do, I mean, are we best mates, or not...? You think on that, while I do *this*.
DionysusRejection03|Dionysus Rejection 03|Dionysus|Look Zag, I'm not going to lie, you hurt my feelings here, I thought we had a thing! A close familial bond! I'm really *mad *now that I think on it!
DionysusRejection04|Dionysus Rejection 04|Dionysus|What, you wouldn't hang with me given the choice? I thought I had you sorted, man, but maybe you just don't appreciate the finer things!
DionysusRejection05|Dionysus Rejection 05|Dionysus|Ah, come on, Zag, now that was not the choice I would have made, you messing with me, man? All right! I'll mess with *you*.
DionysusRejection06|Dionysus Rejection 06|Dionysus|*Ohh*, we all make mistakes from time to time, man, and you ought to know! You made one there just now!
DionysusRejection07|Dionysus Rejection 07|Dionysus|Why do it to me like that, Zag, man, I thought we were close as grapes upon the vine, but I was wrong?
DionysusRejection09|Dionysus Rejection 09|Dionysus|Did I do something to deserve this, man, because I thought that we were getting on just fine, better than fine, but this?
DionysusRejection10|Dionysus Rejection 10|Dionysus|It's not that I'm upset or anything, here, Zag, you know I'm not, but truthfully I am a bit annoyed, a little bit, and so, I got to send the message, man.
DionysusRejection11|Dionysus Rejection 11|Dionysus|Really, man? After everything we've been through together, *this *is the gratitude I get?
DionysusRejection12|Dionysus Rejection 12|Dionysus|Well, way to spoil the feast, there, Zag, I mean come on, I thought I was your mate? Was I mistaken, man?
DionysusRejection13|Dionysus Rejection 13|Dionysus|Zag, I can take a jest, ask anybody, but when it comes to competition here, it's not a laughing matter! Do you understand me, man?
DionysusMakeUp01|Dionysus Make Up 01|Dionysus|All right, all right, all right, we're cool, we're cool, no need to get all hot and bothered any longer, here!
DionysusMakeUp02|Dionysus Make Up 02|Dionysus|OK, let's say we're settled up now, Zag, and go on being best mates just like before, yeah?
DionysusMakeUp03|Dionysus Make Up 03|Dionysus|You know, Zag, you are not so bad, just had a little lapse in judgment, happens to me all the time, now let's get on with it!
DionysusMakeUp04|Dionysus Make Up 04|Dionysus|Hey, now, that was quite a sight, I got to hand it to you, man, and you *deserve *this, here!
DionysusMakeUp05|Dionysus Make Up 05|Dionysus|Know what, man, I'm not even angry after that. What was I even going off about, do you recall...?
DionysusMakeUp06|Dionysus Make Up 06|Dionysus|OK, all right, it's fine already, Zag, you win this time and I am good as grapes.
DionysusMakeUp07|Dionysus Make Up 07|Dionysus|Appreciate your understanding, there, man, so let's just avoid this type of little shake-up next time, yeah?
DionysusMakeUp08|Dionysus Make Up 08|Dionysus|*Hahahahahah*, OK, thanks for a good laugh, there, Zag, what was it I was going on about, before...?
DionysusMakeUp09|Dionysus Make Up 09|Dionysus|Oh I just can't stay mad about you, Zag, and to be honest, why, I wasn't that mad to begin with, I just thought I'd shake your branches up a bit!
DionysusMakeUp10|Dionysus Make Up 10|Dionysus|You're all right, man, you're all right, don't even worry about the rough patch we just crossed back there, we're stronger than all that!
DionysusMakeUp11|Dionysus Make Up 11|Dionysus|I figured this time I'd stay mad at you for sure, man, but you know what, I just couldn't! No matter how hard I tried.
DionysusMakeUp12|Dionysus Make Up 12|Dionysus|It's like I always say, Zag, you have got to permit yourself a bad time every now and again to really appreciate all the good times, yeah?
DionysusMakeUp12|Dionysus Make Up 12|Dionysus|Know what, man, just forget about what happened, yeah? 'Cause I already did, I mean, it happens, right?
DionysusGift01|Dionysus Gift 01|Zagreus|Lord Dionysus, it's been great getting to know you, so, please accept this humble offering.
DionysusGift01|Dionysus Gift 01|Dionysus|Now that is something, a right princely gift, there, Zag, and just so happens I got something here I have been meaning to give you!
DionysusGift02|Dionysus Gift 02|Zagreus|A toast in your honor, Lord Dionysus mate. Have I mentioned how pleased I am to have made your acquaintance?
DionysusGift02|Dionysus Gift 02|Dionysus|*Hoh-oh*, what, is that for me, *really*, I mean, cheers man, that is awful generous of you, I'm much obliged!
DionysusGift03|Dionysus Gift 03|Zagreus|Lord Dionysus mate, you have made the mood down here materially less miserable, and I am much obliged.
DionysusGift03|Dionysus Gift 03|Dionysus|What, is that for me, why Zag, I mean you really shouldn't have, you know I can't get enough of this stuff, right?
DionysusGift04|Dionysus Gift 04|Zagreus|Lord Dionysus mate, you must have no shortage of supreme vintage at your disposal, but this one's from me.
DionysusGift04|Dionysus Gift 04|Dionysus|Why Zag, how positively thoughtful, man, I mean I love it, positively love this stuff, and I am very moved that you would think of me for it!
DionysusGift05|Dionysus Gift 05|Zagreus|Hey, on no occasion whatsoever, cheers to you again, Lord Dionysus mate! This place is so much less dreary under your influence!
DionysusGift05|Dionysus Gift 05|Dionysus|Ah, this is the greatest, Zag! This feast I'm headed to? I was getting a little concerned I wasn't going to have quite enough to go around for everyone. Well, you just saved my evening, man! Too bad you couldn't be there, yeah?
DionysusGift06|Dionysus Gift 06|Zagreus|Dionysus mate, sometimes things weigh heavily on me, but then I hear from you, and it's like I don't have a care in the world! To your health!
DionysusGift06|Dionysus Gift 06|Dionysus|Oh, you're really too much for me sometimes, you know that, man? Got to tell you, I don't think I ever felt so close to somebody so damn far away. But through the gift of drink? It's like we're with each other in spirit, all the time, you know?
DionysusGift07|Dionysus Gift 07|Zagreus|What does one offer to the god of wine? The very best, is what, and down here, this is it, mate! I'm grateful I've got some of your spirit in me. To have such a connection, with you despite all the distance between us...!
DionysusGift07|Dionysus Gift 07|Dionysus|Zag, I cannot believe what you are offering to me! Ambrosia, man, for *me*? And talk about a bottle that has seen some wild days and nights, I mean if it got all the way to you down there, only to come back up! Know what? I'm saving it, till we can share it, here!
AthenaWithDionysus01|Duo - Athena and Dionysus (1)|Athena|Some members of our family do not yet fully understand just how precarious your situation is, Cousin. My Lord Dionysus here, he goes about as though this is a festive matter of some sort!
AthenaWithDionysus01|Duo - Athena and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|Oh, come on, Athena girl, you really mean to tell me that discovering a long-lost relative isn't a cause for celebrating right away, I mean, you can't be telling me a thing like *that*? Because if Zag isn't a cause for feasting, I don't know what is!
DemeterWithDionysus01|Duo - Demeter and Dionysus (1)|Demeter|The crops shall wither and decay so long as I may please, young Zagreus. Although we do have those upon Olympus who take issue with my reasoning...
DemeterWithDionysus01|Duo - Demeter and Dionysus (1)|Dionysus|*Erm*, yeah, milady, I take issue here! I mean how are the grapes supposed to grow and wine supposed to flow when you are so uptight, now, just ease up a little there, let's see what we can do!
