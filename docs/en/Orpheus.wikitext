|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Oh, hello, Zagreus. I understand you liberated me from my eternal punishment. And so I have returned to serve your father here. Thanks."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Orpheus, you're back! Look, don't get on Father's bad side like that and you're going to be fine. Besides... right now I think he's angrier with me."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I grieve for you, my friend. But if you've come to ask me for a song, why, I'm afraid I must stand firm about my answer."

|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Oh, hello Zagreus. I was just wondering if you had ever heard of any other court musicians who had lost the will to sing? Your father's asked me to explain myself and honestly it has been rather difficult."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"If it's any consolation, mate, I'm certain every single undead court musician serving in the throne room of the god of the dead has been through everything you're going through."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Misc Meeting 02
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"It's awfully quiet here, you know, when you're out and about? Makes me a bit self-conscious, truth be told, seeing as ostensibly I'm the musician of this court."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Look, if you decide to start strumming on that lyre again, I'm sure nobody here is going to mind. Though you take care, OK?"

|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Misc Meeting 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Orpheus, forgive my bluntness here, but I have to ask. Why won't you sing? You were a legend, mate! Our court musician!"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Why, it's that I have lost my muse, my friend. It isn't harder to explain than that. Have you not had such moments in your life, where you had lost the will to chase your passions?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I, I suppose I have, yeah. But recently I found my drive again, and that's why I have to get out of here."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"And I am truly happy for you, friend. Alas, I've had no luck in my own search, not that I'm searching any longer, so, I'll just be over here, OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Misc Meeting 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Anything I can do to help you find your muse, mate?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I fear my muse is long since lost to me, my friend, though truly thanks for asking. I suppose she must be out there somewhere still, since I once traveled 'cross this land in search of her, and found her then. But that was quite a while back."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, you found her? What happened?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Well, this was back when I was still alive, you understand. Your father, why, he doesn't care for anyone to leave this realm, and, basically now I'm stuck here as well! Not seen her since, and, I'm not much for travel anymore."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's... I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for letting me know. I hope you get to see her again someday."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I appreciate the sentiment, my friend, though please don't worry about her or me. I mean, we're dead! We're fine."
|-

|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mate, if you don't mind, I'd love it if you told me more about your muse."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"My muse... never has somebody been as splendorous as my Eurydice...! She was so gentle, yet so stout of heart that it would make yours ache, just thinking on it. She inspired innumerable songs of mine."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's quite a few. She sounds like she was a real catch all right. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing your memory of her with me."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Thank you for listening, my friend. Eurydice, she likewise used to listen to me all the time...."

|-

|'''Orpheus'''
|"I understand you've journeyed well beyond the pits of Tartarus, my friend? Another most heroic feat of yours, and truth be told I find it quite inspiring."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Inspiring enough to... make you want to sing, again?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Oh, that's a rather bold insinuation, Zagreus. I don't know that I've the will for that, I... just, I need some time to think, is that all right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Hades 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It sounds like Father's very cross with you, Orpheus. Won't you consider singing once again? You know his threat of further punishment is not a bluff."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Your father can be.... most persuasive, yes, my friend. However, this time, I am... putting my foot down! I have no plans to sing for him again."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well then how about for me? Or for your other friends among the court?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I... no. Please. My muse is gone to me. I can do no such thing."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Pressure 01
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"You seem quite agitated, as of late, my friend. Is anything amiss with you, perhaps?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"*Oh*! No, I'm all right, Orpheus. Just a lot on my mind is all, sorting out what's next. Stuff I need to work through on my own."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Ah, well, I truly understand. I was reluctant to discuss my long-lost muse, really for quite some time. Well, if you do require some emotional support, know that I likely shall be standing over here..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Hermes 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, Orpheus? I heard from Hermes, messenger and god of travel, and all that? It's odd *I'm *giving you his message in this case, but he says hey! Admires your musical ability, as well."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"*Oh*, that was kind of him, my friend! When I first ventured deep into this realm, whilst searching for the soul of my lost muse... after I failed utterly, it was Lord Hermes who whisked her away. It happened so fast. He did an *excellent *job!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Singing 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I always meant to ask you, Orpheus. Where did you learn to sing like that? Was it really Apollo himself who taught you?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"*Oh*, why, I learned from many different sources, Zagreus. That is before all of my inspiration started coming from a single source. I credit my accomplishments to her, and to Apollo, and the gods. And to considerable time spent practicing!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Nyx 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Orpheus? I know Father appreciates your songs, to the extent he's capable of appreciating anything. Though, has Nyx ever responded to them? She's always right nearby yet you two don't seem to talk..."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Almighty Nyx appears to tolerate my presence, Zagreus. For she could cast me into everlasting darkness if my song failed to be pleasing to her. She is a most-discerning listener!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Music Stand 01
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Are you the one whom I should thank for this most wondrous music stand, my friend? Why, it is positively splendid, isn't it?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Our renowned court musician ought to have the finest means available, I think. I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus. Though, tell me something, how can it play your music when you're not even here?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Who can explain the secret art of Daedalus, my friend? Know only that, whenever it produces music for your listening enjoyment, that the sound you hear is coming from my soul!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"So, I am quite confused, I must admit, my friend. The Queen Persephone, she is your mother, then? How is it that she came to reside, here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, *erm*... it all started when my father saw her on Olympus, and... they fell madly in love. He swept her off her feet, and brought her here. The Olympians, they got pretty worried when they saw she was gone. But now it's OK! Everything's out in the open."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"But, surely the Queen's mother on Olympus, the great goddess Demeter... surely she would quite like it if she saw her daughter still, from time to time?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, that! Thing is, Mother ate some... pomegranate seeds when she was here. And we have rules about that stuff, you know! It means she cannot leave this place for very long at all. I'm sure Demeter will understand. And unfreeze everything when her daughter's around."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Ah, yes, pomegranate seeds, of course, of course! Though, there is one more subject I don't understand, which is... how *you *fit into all of this. Were you not trying to escape from here?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Forget about me, Orpheus! This isn't about me, it's about Mother. What's important is she's here, where she belongs."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I see! I understand. Well, thank you, then, for clearing all that up. It is a splendid tale, I must say, and every part of it makes sense to me, at last."
|-

|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"This is amazing, mate. So does this mean you found your muse?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Oh no, I never found my muse, my friend. It's just... seeing you carrying on like this time after time, I was reminded I ought to get on with my life, too, such as it is right now."

|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Sings Again 01 D
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I became so enthralled with song once more, my friend, that I have been inspired to compose another one. For old time's sake, perhaps."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"This is amazing, mate. You sing quite beautifully, with or without your muse."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"How kind of you, although... my voice is nothing but the crunch of gravel underfoot compared to hers, which soars as though on wings."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, Orpheus? I ever tell you I once single-handedly slew a multi-headed bone hydra within the magma fields of Asphodel without so much as breaking a sweat?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"My, that is wonderful to hear, my friend! Another in a litany of such heroic deeds, more noble than the heroes of our verse, and even great Achilles over there!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'm glad you think so, mate! These tales of my valorous accomplishments do seem to cheer you up, so, I will keep reporting back once I rack up some more."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Orpheus? You know about the time I vanquished seven legions of Bloodless warriors with both hands tied behind my back while hopping on one foot? Lord Poseidon dared me to do it, you know."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Why, that is a spectacularly vivid tale, Zagreus, and most deserving to be chronicled in song! Would that there were a poet here still willing to commit such deeds to verse."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Orpheus? I take it you know all about the time I burned my father's hands to a crisp the moment I was born? He grasped me by the feet, and they caught fire! And that's why he still wears those fancy rings: to cover up the hideous scar tissue."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"But that is such a splendid tale, Zagreus, deserving to be sung both far and wide, until it turns into the stuff of myth, as deathless as the gods themselves! I'll gladly tell that one about!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Orpheus, you've noticed the resemblance between me and Dionysus, haven't you, mate? I'll tell you a little secret but you have to promise not to tell... We're really the same god. I love a good feast, don't I?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"But, Zagreus, that is a striking revelation, the connection you describe. I see it! I can see it now! To think the god of wine and you are intricately linked, it isn't obvious, is it?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, there's more to it! A bit grim, really, as I'm a little older than I look. You see, the Titans, they once tore me limb from limb, but then my heart was saved, and that's where Dionysus comes from! That is the connection between us, you understand me, mate?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Your tale stirs my soul, it truly does, my friend. It is a marvel to me that such heroism isn't widely known, and I'm committed to the spread of all such truths."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey Orpheus, you know I've just been messing with you, with those Dionysus tales, and all that? Just trying to liven things up for us, mate."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Oh, Zagreus! There isn't need for such humility, not when one's deeds of heroism are as great and numerous as yours! It is an honor to have heard such deeds first-hand!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 06
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, mate, sometimes I worry that you're taking my tall tales rather seriously. You're not really going about and telling everyone this stuff, are you?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Come now, my friend! I know this is a test of faith! Of course I am committed to the spread of such heroic deeds as yours. And I do so enjoy getting to hear them first!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 07
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Orpheus? I figure that you've heard by now about how I bested the Minotaur Asterius, alongside Theseus, the Champion of Elysium, himself? I don't think I even broke a sweat."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I scarce can possibly imagine such a spectacle, my friend! But certainly I shall attempt to try!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Tall Tale 08
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Orpheus, you have to hear this straight from me. I vanquished my own father, on the outskirts of the Temple of Styx. At the surface! I know how this looks, since I'm back here, and so is he. You believe me, don't you?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Of *course *I do, my friend! Though, you must know, your father has requested his relationship to you be kept quite clandestine. You'll understand if I not sing your praises in this case, won't you?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus Sings Again 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Orpheus, sorry to interrupt, it's just... I couldn't help but notice that new ballad that you're playing, there."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Technically, one ought consider it a hymn, my friend! In honor of your numerous travails, prior to your current set of circumstances, which must pale in comparison to all the rigors you've endured to date!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"*Erm*, the thing is... none of the information in your hymn is accurate. It's nonsense. I was just kidding with you, mate! I tried to make that clear. You get so lively when I tell you my tall tales, you know? You're not angry with me, are you...?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Heavens, no, my friend! Your humility is matched only by your perseverance in the face of adversity! May your great deeds live on forever, much like you!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Eurydice 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, Orpheus. You wouldn't happen to know the nymph Eurydice, would you? Tall, woodsy type? I get the impression maybe you know each other."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"*What*? Why... yes. I know Eurydice. Or, I once knew her, I should say. Whyever would you ask me such a thing, my friend?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I saw her, mate. In Asphodel. She's doing fine up there! All on her own. The two of you, you used to know each other, then?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"We more than knew each other, Zagreus. We were husband and wife. She was my muse. To think that we are doomed to be apart during our afterlives. Ah, well!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"*Ah, well*? Don't you have a message I could bring to her, if we should meet again? Something like that?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"I do not wish to trouble her again, my friend. Speak not to her of me, all right? I have my memory of her; it is enough."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Eurydice 01 B
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, Orpheus. You're not going to believe this. I happened on a certain nymph during my journeys recently. It was Eurydice. Tall, woodsy type?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"*What*? Why... truly. I knew Eurydice resided in your father's realm, but... I had not anticipated you would cross her path. You're certain of this, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I saw her, mate. In Asphodel. She's doing fine up there! All on her own. You said the two of you were very close, isn't that right?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''

|"You *what*?! Or, what I meant to say was: Oh. Did you perchance get the impression she yet harbors toward me feelings of resentment, and the like?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You seemed to be a bit of a sore subject, yes. What happened to the two of you, if I may ask?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Oh, it's just... I almost saved her soul from this domain, back when I lived and breathed. But in the final moments of my rescue, my faith faltered. She is lost to me forever, now. Though, I'm pleased to hear she isn't lost to you!"

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She's all right, Orpheus. Seems comfortable within her little place in Asphodel. The only thing that seems to bother her at all is... when I mention you. Is there nothing you can do to patch things up?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Alas, I cannot change the past, my friend. So, no. As you can plainly see by now, I'm dead to her. Rightfully so, at that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But that's just a technicality! I mean, you're here, she's there! So what if you're not breathing anymore, you have all eternity ahead of you. Don't you want to see her again?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Don't I want to see my Eurydice again...? Why, yes. That, more than anything, my friend. Provided she wanted to see me. I tried once to disturb her everlasting rest, as you well know. And that did not pan out as I had hoped...."
|-
! colspan="2" |Orpheus About Eurydice 04

|"What news of late about Eurydice, my friend? She is as delicate as I described, no doubt? *Ah*, but... I am dwelling on her once again, it seems."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I knew she was a talented musician, mate, but you never let on that she is an amazing chef, as well. She's been hospitable to me each time we've met. Though you still seem to be a bit of a sore subject."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"How very understandable, indeed. Were I to have been failed to be rescued from the depths of hell, mere moments from escape, I too would be quite cross with my attempted rescuer. And for quite some time."
|-

|"I have no knowledge of the weavings of the Fates, my friend. Perhaps they trample on what used to be my heart for leisure or for sport, do you suppose?"
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Say, Orpheus, Eurydice told me your songs, some of them came from her? She seems quite brilliant. You choose your muses well!"

|"I owe my everything to my Eurydice. She authored many of my songs, indeed; and she inspired many, many more. Whilst living, we collaborated frequently, you see."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"But weren't you the famous one? I don't understand why she doesn't share your renown."
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"It is but one of life's injustices, I fear. I always sang her praises every chance I had. And she asserted herself splendidly. Yet even still, our listeners believed our songs, they came from me... what else could I have done?"

|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Why, I don't know, my friend. Once people set their minds to certain things... it can be difficult to show them other possibilities exist. What's to be done?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know... tell them they're wrong? Politely, perhaps not? Or... tell them what's right. Get the word out about what's right? Can't we do that?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Get the word out...? But I am court musician of this House. My songs no longer reach too many ears. Although... I do suppose all of these shades about... they are my audience, as well. I shall make certain that they know whose songs I sing."

|"You sound despondent again, mate. You must wish you were there right now. I'm sorry you had to come all the way back."
|-

|"Oh, on the contrary, Zagreus. It dawned upon me that having some distance between my responsibilities and my domestic life, why... it is not so bad. Besides, Charon makes travel to and fro quite simple for me, really."

|"You're sorry, Zagreus? Whatever for? If not for you, I fear I never would have seen my muse again."
|-

|"Well, it's just... when I met her, and I found out the two of you were having problems, I... well, I just wanted to see you patch things up. But, it wasn't any of my business, and you never asked my help. Neither did she. I could have made things worse."
|-
