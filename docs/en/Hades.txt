--- Ending 01 ---
Persephone: ...I spent many days tending this garden... or nights? Quite difficult to tell the time here. But, it's held on longer than I would have expected...
Hades: ...Persephone... I...
Persephone: Cerberus! I missed you so. And dutiful as ever, aren't you.
Hades: ...I'm sorry. Know that I am sorry.
Persephone: Hades... you look tired. Though, I am not the only one you ought to be apologizing to.
Hades: I know. I know, I.... Why have you returned? If Olympus... if your mother discovers what happened, not even Zeus, not even *he *could stop what would transpire, here!
Persephone: *Oh*, I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Zagreus to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could just return the way I came?
Hades: A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Persephone.
Persephone: You're right, Hades! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?
Hades: ...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
Persephone: Then, first, talk to your son.
Hades: ...*Mm*. Zagreus? You have already met Persephone, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!
Zagreus: Wow, Father, you called me by my name! What is this strange sensation that I feel? Perhaps it's this *deference *of which you speak?
Persephone: Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, Hades. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
Hades: Yes. I... Zagreus. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
Zagreus: What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought... you're honest.
Hades: Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left... believing you were stillborn... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done.
Zagreus: Well, you didn't need to vent all that inner turmoil onto me throughout my life. Though, I think I understand. I only wish I could have understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I've grown so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really going to miss it.
Hades: About that... your *ransacking *revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
Persephone: Zagreus... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
Zagreus: Question, Father. Let's say I accept. When next I reach the surface... is it still going to be you waiting up there?
Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
Zagreus: So I just battle to the surface and repeatedly kill my own father, then?
Hades: You have it half-correct!
Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
Zagreus: *Hahaha*, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
Persephone: Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?
Zagreus: *After all this time*, it's only been a few days! But it's been good. Mother and Father are back together, made some new friends, got this fancy painting! Easy. All is well in the Underworld!


--- Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 01 ---
Hades: You now know that, even if you are able to surpass me, you shall ultimately perish, soon enough. And yet you still persist! Utterly senseless.
Zagreus: I found her, Father. And I'm going to find Mother again. And again, and again, until I have some answers, finally. She'd like some answers, too, beginning with *why did you never tell her that I lived*? You let her go, and left her to her grief!
Hades: *Silence*, boy! Save all your ignorant and baseless accusations. You seem incapable of heeding my request that you not blather on about a matter you shall never understand. Then, I shall save my breath for this fight!


--- Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 02 ---
Hades: You were never supposed to live. Took all of Nyx's strength to circumvent what should have been a certainty. Now you cannot stay dead. Such is the wry humor of the Fates.
Zagreus: Nyx saved me.... So according to the Fates I was never meant to be born, since neither you nor Mother are of the Underworld, something like that? Or was that just another lie you told, to Mother and whoever else?
Hades: *Bah! *You think everything a lie. The realm beneath our feet was appointed to me on certain conditions, not that I had much of a choice. Among them: A one-time surface-dweller such as I would never have an heir.
Zagreus: You really believed that? Then why attempt to have a child, anyway?
Hades: You don't know anything! Why anyone would *choose *to have a child is a mystery to me. The Fates said I would never have an heir. Perhaps *this *was all they meant.


--- Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 05 ---
Hades: To think Olympus has been aiding you. You must be so grateful to them for their aid, without which none of this would have been possible.
Zagreus: Yeah, about that. Father, did... did you let Mother go because you feared Olympus would find out? And... not respond well to the circumstances if they did?
Hades: *Tsch. *Be grateful they have not found out as yet, for all your meddling. You do not know them as well as you think. Ask yourself why she left Olympus, and how. Or better yet, ask *her*.
Zagreus: Well, she seems quite lovely, so... knowing you, you probably tricked her into signing a pact to come join you, or something. Since you weren't allowed on Olympus, why not have Olympus come to you?
Hades: *Hah*! Surprisingly not distant from the truth. I took her, boy! I took her down with me. Is that what you wish to hear? Does that anger you? Come, bring forth that anger, then!


--- Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 06 ---
Hades: So, boy. Did you ask her? About how she came to join me in the Underworld. Did you confirm all your suspicions, then?
Zagreus: You didn't drag her down to hell, yourself, apparently. You're not going to tell me who did, though I can well imagine. Your brothers got to reign forever on Olympus, while you got sent down into the Underworld. So they gave you a consolation prize... didn't they?
Hades: You make such accusations, knowing next to nothing. Careless as ever. Poseidon had nothing to do with it! He knows even less than you. If you value her existence or your own, you would be wise to keep it that way. And to turn back!


--- Lord Hades About Persephone Meeting 07 ---
Hades: ...She was the Queen. Queen of the Underworld! My Queen. Commanding reverence, and awe, and fear. She was not just... what was the term you used? A *consolation prize*? You are as disrespectful to her as you are to me.
Zagreus: Oh, what would you even know?! You claim so much respect for her, yet you didn't even respect her enough to tell her what happened after she left! But... what am I saying... I know you love her, still, Father. That best explains all the terrible choices you've made.
Hades: ...All the terrible choices I've made. By the time you have existed for as long as I have, pray you will have made fewer. Although I fear you shall surpass me in at least this one regard.


--- Lord Hades Before Persephone Return 01 ---
Hades: ...I have done virtually everything within my power to prevent this. All of it... for nothing. The Fates were not content to saddle me within the earth; they mock me, still.
Zagreus: Maybe they just think you're in the wrong. And that you're an obstinate, overbearing, miserable excuse for a husband and father. Don't you understand I'm trying to fix the problems you caused? Since you're so unwilling to do it yourself.
Hades: You're right. I was unwilling. I made my choices, in all this. I loved her, yes. I loved her terribly. But now... it seems I am merely delaying the inevitable. Go, then. Go to her. But, should harm befall her... I shall bring my worst wrath upon whomever is to blame... including you.
Zagreus: What? You're letting me go, just like that? You're just afraid of getting struck down again. You're serious?


--- Lord Hades Post Ending 01 ---
Hades: *Heh. *Confronting you like this... it's different now. Still... it is a responsibility, just as before. There is to be no escape from my realm. Ultimately, I must see to that, myself.
Zagreus: That's the spirit, Father! As for me, I find the candor of our interactions here to be rather refreshing, I must say. Especially the interactions between my weapons and your physique. You're tough, but you're an easy target.
Hades: And you are scrawny, though slippery, blast you. All that pent-up rage behind your smiling words... come, unleash it once again. I expect you to go all out. To the death!


--- Lord Hades Extreme Measures 01 ---
Hades: I was reviewing the terms of the Pact of Punishment to which you are bound. Even when my servants resort to extreme measures, they were still unable to surpass you, then. So now, it is my turn.
Zagreus: Caught you unprepared, did I? After Theseus and his Macedonian, I half-expected to see you thundering around on some golden chariot of your own, drawn by sable steeds, that sort of thing. But it's just you.
Hades: It is just me, indeed. However... that should be more than necessary, here. No holding back this time, Zagreus. Are you ready?


--- Lord Hades Has Guan Yu Aspect 01 ---
Hades: What have you done with my ancient weapon, boy? I sense Varatha's form there in your feeble grip, but... there's some garish power you've awakened in it, haven't you?
Zagreus: Oh, just took a splash of Titan Blood at the right time was all. There's more to your ancient weapon than you gave it credit for, I guess. Though let's not keep it waiting, no?
Hades: No, let's not. Gigaros is the mightier weapon, with none of the treacherous past. It needs no fanciful shape-shifting tricks to run you through. Behold!


--- Lord Hades Has Arthur Aspect 01 ---
Hades: I never had any respect for Stygius, that blade you bear. Perhaps unfairly, due to Brother Poseidon's sloppy form when once he wielded it. But now it seems quite different in your care.
Zagreus: I think we've grown quite close to one another, yes. Enough to where I've come to know a different side of this fine blade right here. This is the aspect of some Arthur fellow! Maybe the two of you could get acquainted properly?
Hades: *Arthur! *No name either of gods or kings of any realm I know. Then, introduce us, as you say! To this new amateur, to whom your blade rendered its services.


--- Lord Hades Has Rama Aspect 01 ---
Hades: The bow is the weapon of a coward, boy. I said so even to Hera's face. I'm unsurprised that you are drawn to it, and yet... something has changed about it, I can tell.
Zagreus: What, you mean that Coronacht has taken on the aspect of a divine preserver person of some sort, of whom I've seen mere glimpses but seems definitely very capable, and really rather brave?
Hades: I know not why the old Infernal Arms endear themselves to you. And, I entirely care not in whose weakling aspect you bring them forth, only to fall to me.


--- Lord Hades Has Beowulf Aspect 01 ---
Hades: There you are, bearing my brother's blasted shield... flaunting it about so recklessly. Though, what have you done to it, now?
Zagreus: Not much, really, besides awakening the aspect of a supposedly unstoppable, dragon-slaying warrior called Beowulf. If it has the power to protect him against a giant lizard, I figure it may help me against you.
Hades: You presently shall find I'm no mere giant lizard, boy. Though we shall see whether this Beowulf is any help to you.


--- Lord Hades Has Gilgamesh Aspect 01 ---
Hades: Resorting to mere fisticuffs with me... though, how you got Malphon to look like that, I've no idea. Pray tell, whose monstrous claws are those? A manticore's?
Zagreus: These claws, I'll have you know, Father, belonged once to an ancient god-king known as Gilgamesh. You ever meet?
Hades: *Hrm*. Provided he was flesh and blood at some point, then he resides within my realm. Presumably within Elysium somewhere, sadly bereft of his manticore claws, thanks to you. Come, show me what they can do.


--- Lord Hades Has Lucifer Aspect 01 ---
Hades: You approach me with that loathsome Rail, boy. Emanating a hellish fury more even than usual, at that. Little surprise you took a shine to it. It was the weapon that I hated most of all.
Zagreus: Well, someone called Lucifer apparently thought differently, and took a crack at his own father with it, once. This one's for him, then.
Hades: Invoking names you know nothing about. Presuming, all the while, far too much. You take that monstrous artifact for another friend? You would be wiser to be wary of its influence. But, let us fight.


--- Lord Hades Misc Encounter 05 ---
Hades: *Ah*, but there you are, boy, finally. Despite my knowing you are always late for everything, here you've outdone yourself by quite some time.
Zagreus: Oh shut up, and get your fork, and burn away that regal cape, and let's get to this, then. I'd no idea you had all these capes to spare! Must have a whole entire storage chamber full of them.
Hades: Your mockery of me may temporarily embolden you, but achieves nothing useful, in the end.


--- Lord Hades Misc Encounter 03 ---
Hades: This cold white substance falling slowly from the heavens. Snow, they call it. Look carefully upon each fleck. Tiny crystals! But structurally weak. They melt! This surface realm... it is held up by mine.
Zagreus: If you're quite finished teaching me about this snow phenomenon, can we get on with brutally trying to kill each other, here?
Hades: You wish to have your mortal-colored blood spill once again upon this bed of snow, then fine. Let us proceed.


--- Lord Hades Misc Encounter 06 ---
Hades: You still have yet to see the sun itself. You know only the light of Ixion, but the sun? It is positively blinding. Hideous.
Zagreus: It has been snowy nightfall every single time now that you mention it. I didn't know it snowed so much up here.
Hades: It hasn't always. But, that's of no consequence to us. Especially when there's a raging battle to be fought.


--- Lord Hades Post Epilogue 01 ---
Hades: If you are here, then... the Olympians must still be lending you their aid. Just as before! I scarce believe the Queen's preposterous idea worked. That all it took to settle an old score was a blasted family feast.
Zagreus: Come on, Father, even you must have enjoyed that feast to some extent. We ought to do it more often! Good thing you trusted Mother's judgment on that one. So, then, to the death, once more?
Hades: Indeed. To the death, as always, boy. Zagreus. Ready yourself.


--- Lord Hades Encounter 01 ---
Hades: ...I never grew accustomed to the air, up here. It gusts senselessly whichever way it pleases. I suppose you must prefer it to the stillness of the air below.
Zagreus: You know, you're right. The air up here seems pretty good so far. But I will reserve judgment till I've had my fill. I have to say, though, Father: The Helm of Darkness suits you. I'm touched you'd dust it off on my account.
Hades: It should not have had to come to this. For all your antics with me and around the House, I always kept my temper, have I not? Unlike you.
Zagreus: Well, let's see. You've berated me repeatedly and often. You've lied to me. Mustered your wretched forces to kill me, over and over. But, sure, I'll grant you that you've always kept most of your anger bottled up. All that's about to change, then?
Hades: We're gods, boy. Killing one another is our lot. Although, I always thought I was above it. I told you that you cannot leave this place. It seems I must enforce my rules myself. I'm sending you home, now.


--- Lord Hades Encounter 01 B ---
Hades: ...I never grew accustomed to the air, up here. It gusts senselessly whichever way it pleases. I suppose you must prefer it to the stillness of the air below.
Zagreus: You know, you're right. The air up here seems pretty good so far. But I will reserve judgment till I've had my fill. I have to say, though, Father: The Helm of Darkness suits you. I'm touched you'd dust it off on my account.
Hades: It should not have had to come to this. For all your antics with me and around the House, I always kept my temper, have I not? Unlike you.
Zagreus: Well let's see. You've berated me repeatedly and often. You've lied to me. Mustered a bunch of incompetent wretches to try to kill me. But, sure, I'll grant you that you've always kept most of your anger bottled up. All that's about to change, then?
Hades: We're gods, boy. Killing one another is our lot. Although, I always thought I was above it. I told you that you cannot leave this place. It seems I must enforce my rules myself. I'm sending you home, now.


--- Lord Hades Encounter You Defeated 01 ---
Hades: You know now what you're doing here is without any purpose whatsoever. Even if I don't slay you myself, you'll simply perish when you cross that threshold there. And yet you still persist?
Zagreus: I do. Besides, making these treks helps pass the time during the ongoing Underworld renovations. And I'll be in tiptop shape once they're complete!
Hades: Would that we had a little more support; the renovations could have been complete by now! As ever, you think only of yourself. But if you must insist like this, then you will find me waiting for you once you get here. Every single time.


--- Lord Hades Encounter Done Talking 01 ---
Hades: Why? Why do you keep showing up? In spite of knowing that the outcome shall be just the same as how it always was?
Zagreus: Beats having to toil away under your overbearing supervision. And besides, as you may be aware, I've recently made up my mind to leave this place.
Hades: *Eughh*... utterly incorrigible. When next we meet here, then, we'll keep it brief. I have grown weary of our aimless conversations. Now prepare!


--- Lord Hades Hades Keepsake Reaction 01 ---
Hades: You bear the Sigil of the Dead. I wear the Helm of Darkness. Even devoid of artifacts as these, we fight here without witnesses... in shadow.
Zagreus: If only everybody knew you had a mighty son most capable of cutting you down to size, with or without the ability to vanish suddenly.
Hades: A very boastful son, who often thinks too much of his ability. Come, then! I'll make you vanish suddenly.


--- Lord Hades Persephone Keepsake Reaction 01 ---
Hades: ...That pomegranate blossom... I caught its subtle scent as you approached. The Queen has her mother's strength. And much more self control.
Zagreus: What, you're afraid of a little flower, now, Father? One that imbues me with the fiercest might of Olympus, granted, but still! It looks harmless, at least.
Hades: I fear your little flower there much more than you. The Queen and her mother... they possess power over life. Thus, power over death.


--- Lord Hades Extreme Measures 02 ---
Hades: Extreme measures permitted, even still? You must have forgotten to change the conditions of your Pact of Punishment.
Zagreus: Wasn't an oversight. You're strong, Father. I want to be as strong, and more. Not that I'm taking after you, or anything.
Hades: You wish to test yourself against the full extent of my wrath, then very well. You have earned that right. Besides yourself, only the Titans have. Now, then... *attack*!


--- Lord Hades Extreme Measures 03 ---
Hades: You vanquished me... even when I threw everything I had at you, and more. I fought you as I fought the Titans themselves, and still I failed.
Zagreus: Oh, don't take it so hard, Father. There's always next time, right? Meaning, this time. Maybe I won't be so fortunate.
Hades: Of that, I am most certain. Come, let us see the limits of our abilities, then. I warn you: I shall hold nothing back. To the death!


--- Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 01 ---
Hades: ...Nary a whif of Mount Olympus on you, this time. How is it that you clambered all this way, without the generous support of your dear family? Doubtless you merely purged their blessings for some coin.
Zagreus: Hey, I resent that, Father! I'm more than capable of getting here all on my own, now, thanks.
Hades: Such arrogance has led to many a mortal's downfall... and many a god's.


--- Lord Hades No Boons Reaction 02 ---
Hades: Odd. No stink of Olympus on you, this time. Have you truly come all this way without assistance from your relatives? Or were you overzealous at a Pool of Purging?
Zagreus: Wouldn't you like to know? Not even Nyx believed that I could come this far without aid from the Olympians. Maybe I just have a knack for proving everybody wrong.
Hades: You have a *knack *for being struck down in various, ignoble ways, that much is certain. Come, then! Show me what you, yourself, can do!


--- Lord Hades About Fishing 01 ---
Hades: Be still. These waters... teeming with Poseidon's river denizens. That one there, before me... it's been taunting me, I think, for quite some time.
Zagreus: You offering to take me *fishing*, Father? Sounds more pleasant than having you slaughter me again, or the other way around.
Hades: You mistook my meaning. First, *you *shall have my spear. Then, that thing shall, if it has not yet come to its senses. Though, if you vanquish me, I'm certain your uncle shall not mind if you extract it, yourself.


--- Lord Hades Pact High Heat Reaction 01 ---
Hades: It is a testament to the awful might of Demeter that, even with the surge of heat created by the Pact of Punishment you toy with recklessly, this place remains a frozen waste.
Zagreus: The Pact did make the road here a little more fraught than usual. But if it couldn't stop me, I can't imagine it could stop Demeter.
Hades: Forget her, and the blasted Pact. I'll stop you, myself.


--- Lord Hades Winter Curse Reaction 01 ---
Hades: Enjoying the delicate warmth of the surface, b-- Zagreus? Apparently, the generosity of the goddess of seasons knows no bounds.
Zagreus: Does feel a bit different, maybe. Though, Demeter said something about how this spot, in particular, would remain bereft of warmth, as a reminder. Do you think she knows what happened with Mother, really?
Hades: Demeter may harbor vengeful feelings and suspicions, but she is no fool. Experience teaches us to know when to quit. Though, evidently, that is a lesson you have yet to learn.


--- Lord Hades Low Health 01 ---
Hades: Look at yourself, boy. You barely stand, and yet believe you can surpass me in your current state?
Zagreus: It's not exactly easy getting here, you know. But I'm not going back. Not yet.
Hades: Perhaps not yet. But very, very soon.


--- Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 01 ---
Hades: Varatha... I recognize its presence, now. That's not just any three-pronged lance you wield. I could never stand to look at it, once my brothers and my sisters and myself... once our foul work was done.
Zagreus: You mean once you'd chopped up your cruel and overbearing Titan parents, right? Shame you threw it out. It's quite useful.
Hades: Perhaps the Fates decided that its wielders ought to all eventually wind up on its receiving end. Come, then! Let us see what the great Achilles has taught you.


--- Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 02 ---
Hades: So! You think that you can vanquish me with my fool brother's old, forgotten blade. Poseidon was never any good with Stygius. Grew envious of my spearwork. Now he's famous for that fork of his! Always taking credit where none is due.
Zagreus: Must be hard, knowing that everybody's going to think you learned your spearwork from Poseidon, not the other way around. As for Stygius, I can assure you it's in good hands now.
Hades: Your assurances mean nothing to me, boy. You think yourself quite capable? Then show me.


--- Lord Hades Has Weapon Upgrade 03 ---
Hades: You come here bearing brother Zeus' Aegis. I wonder how much more insulting you could be.
Zagreus: What? I haven't even started to insult you here yet, Father. Flustered by the old Shield of Chaos, then?
Hades: Doubtless Zeus does not even remember wielding it. I never should have relied on him for anything after that! Then, come. Let's see if you're any better with it than your great uncle.


--- Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01 ---
Hades: *Hrm*. It grew distinctly colder just as you arrived. So *Demeter *has been in contact with you, then. That witch. Tell me how much she knows.
Zagreus: What? I don't... wait, this everlasting winter, it's her doing, isn't it? Why? Don't mortals die when it's cold? Sounds like a lot of extra work for you.
Hades: Then you are ignorant. Keep it that way, with her. Lest you risk everything, you understand? The consequences would be far worse than a foul stretch of weather. But, enough talk, now.


--- Lord Hades About Eternal Winter 01 B ---
Hades: Hrm. It grew distinctly colder just as you arrived. So Demeter has been in contact with you, then. That witch. Tell me how much she knows.
Zagreus: She lost her daughter... who's my mother. But, Demeter still thinks I'm Nyx's son, and... what have you done, Father? This everlasting winter, it's her doing, isn't it? Freezing mortals to death. Why don't you stop this?
Hades: The two of you know nothing, then, it seems. Keep it that way, especially with her. Lest you risk everything, you understand? The consequences would be far worse than a foul stretch of weather. But, enough talk, now.


--- Lord Hades Misc Encounter 01 ---
Hades: ...The sea... the heavens, and the earth. All of this belongs to my brothers. We are their kin by birth. But we are foreigners in their country.
Zagreus: No. No mournful speeches. Now get out of my way.
Hades: You impertinent brat. Fine. Impulsiveness runs in the family.


--- Lord Hades Misc Encounter 02 ---
Hades: There was a time when Cerberus would never have permitted any soul to exit through that gateway there behind you.
Zagreus: Oh, that can't possibly be true! What about Orpheus, Theseus, Heracles, Odysseus? Countless tales of brave men delving into the Underworld, then leaving whence they came!
Hades: They left on my authority alone. Nor did they take for granted my good graces. You believe you are entitled simply to walk out of here. From your birthright and your responsibilities! But I am here to tell you, *no*.


--- Lord Hades Misc Encounter 04 ---
Hades: My brothers and my sisters and myself. We, too, wanted to slay our parents. The Titans. Bastards. And worse.
Zagreus: And you succeeded. Chopped up some of them into many tiny bits, and sprinkled them throughout the pits of Tartarus so that they can't regenerate! Or so I hear. Inspiring, really!
Hades: We had no recourse at the time, save to collaborate. Developed a specific plan, and saw it through. And, the Titans...? You think me cruel, yet know nothing of cruelty. But, here, you want something to hate, then have it!


--- Lord Hades Misc Encounter 07 ---
Hades: I must admit to something, boy. Achilles taught you reasonably well. I expected that if anyone could train you into martial competence, it would be him.
Zagreus: Though you didn't expect that, one day, I would end up using everything I learned from him against *you*.
Hades: I anticipate more than you know. But Achilles merely practiced against mortals. Now, you practice against *me*.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 01 ---
Hades: Come all this way again, to fall to me? Would that you paid me such respects back at the House.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 02 ---
Hades: What is it going to take for you to understand that your place is in the House?!


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 03 ---
Hades: I shall give you no quarter, boy. Although I doubt that you expected otherwise.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 04 ---
Hades: The sea and air are very still this eve. Though I suppose that is about to change.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 05 ---
Hades: Know only that I take no pleasure in what I am now forced to do.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 06 ---
Hades: There you are. Then let us now commence this ugly business yet again.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 07 ---
Hades: The heavens and the seas belong to my brothers; but know that you are still in *my *domain.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 08 ---
Hades: You bypassed Cerberus again, I see. Unfortunately for the both of us.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 09 ---
Hades: I had other pressing business to attend to. But I cannot let you leave.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 10 ---
Hades: No matter how many times you try, your stubbornness shall get you nowhere with me.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 11 ---
Hades: You're back, with Stygius in hand. Come then, and show me your technique!


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 12 ---
Hades: The Blade of the Underworld cannot help you here, you realize that, boy?


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 13 ---
Hades: Your heart-seeking Coronacht may have brought you this far, but shall not help you, here.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 14 ---
Hades: That heart-seeking bow you wield... it is nothing but a tool for cowards, boy.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start With Spear 01 ---
Hades: So, Varatha and Gigaros are to clash again upon this empty field. Let us have at it, then.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start With Spear 02 ---
Hades: I knew someday the Eternal Spear would turn on me. Let's see you wield it, boy.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 15 ---
Hades: The Shield of Chaos... what a monstrous thing. How suitable for you.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 16 ---
Hades: You bear the Aegis so much like your uncle Zeus once did.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 17 ---
Hades: You think the Rail of Adamant can vanquish me? We'll momentarily find out.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 18 ---
Hades: You would take aim at me with Exagryph? Then, very well.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 19 ---
Hades: You would attack me with the savagery of the Twin Fists? Then, come.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 20 ---
Hades: Again, you seek to use the power of Malphon against me. Fine.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 21 ---
Hades: You are predictable in your arrivals here. Less so during the fight itself.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 22 ---
Hades: I was just thinking on when last I vanquished you. Come, refresh my memory.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 23 ---
Hades: No matter how often you defeat me, I shall face you here.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 24 ---
Hades: Remember, I can always get here much, much faster than you.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 25 ---
Hades: No matter how quickly you're able to get here, I shall be waiting.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 26 ---
Hades: Again, you draw me from all my responsibilities back at the House.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 27 ---
Hades: I cannot let you go, boy. Some night such as this one, you'll understand.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 28 ---
Hades: I shall be interested to see if you can vanquish me again, here, boy.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 29 ---
Hades: Come, show me everything you've learned of how to fight.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 30 ---
Hades: You've slipped by Cerberus again, I see. Then, draw your weapon, boy.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 31 ---
Hades: I see it's time again that we begin our bloody business here.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 32 ---
Hades: This blasted place... how can you even stand it on the surface, here?


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 33 ---
Hades: Who shall be first to return home this time, do you suppose?


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 34 ---
Hades: It seems it's time again I sent you home, myself.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 35 ---
Hades: Your rampage through my realm ends here and now.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 36 ---
Hades: I thought you might arrive right about now. Then, let us have our fight.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 37 ---
Hades: You'll go not one step farther past this threshold, boy.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 38 ---
Hades: The world beyond my realm is not for you. You're going home.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 40 ---
Hades: I wonder, boy, who's going to kill whom this time around.


--- Lord Hades Misc Start 41 ---
Hades: I cannot fathom why you wish to die repeatedly like this.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 01 ---
Hades: Already here? It seems our Underworld still has many failings I shall have to deal with, after this.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 02 ---
Hades: Come show your father what you've learned of late. Do not hold back.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 03 ---
Hades: Would that you cleaned your chambers with the same devotion you show getting to these heights.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 04 ---
Hades: Untold murderous wretches in my realm, all at my beck and call, yet still you made it here.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 05 ---
Hades: You have circumvented all of my security measures again. But can you get through *me*?


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 06 ---
Hades: I trust you have retained enough of your strength through this ordeal to make this worth our while?


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 07 ---
Hades: Catch your breath if necessary, and then let us see if you shall earn your bonus for this day.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 08 ---
Hades: *Bah*! Not one of my overseers managed to stop you, again? Must I do everything myself?


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 09 ---
Hades: I've other work to get to! Arm yourself, and let us end this quickly, boy.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 10 ---
Hades: It seems our realm has many weaknesses. I shall deal with them shortly, then.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 11 ---
Hades: Let us see if the support you're getting from Olympus amounts to anything of use.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 12 ---
Hades: Blast, but you're persistent, even now! Though let us see how strong you are, as well.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 13 ---
Hades: I should be getting back to my desk. But I suppose the work can wait.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 14 ---
Hades: *Ah*, there you are, boy! I was beginning to think I'd need a thicker cloak.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 15 ---
Hades: Well, Zagreus. Even if I vanquish you, arriving here is a sufficient feat.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 16 ---
Hades: I must admit, this is a welcome change of pace from all the parchmentwork.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 17 ---
Hades: I suppose that you must be eager to repay me for last time, then?


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 18 ---
Hades: I expect I shall be able to vanquish you again. Though, we shall see.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 19 ---
Hades: Perhaps the blasted Fates shall favor *me*, for once.


--- Lord Hades Post Ending Start 20 ---
Hades: Our last exchange left much to be desired, for my part. But this time, we shall see.


--- Lord Hades R 1 First Win ---
Hades: ...*Tsch*. To have been brought this low... by my own ungrateful child. I would expect such treatment from my brothers, but from you...? *Nrrrgghhh*....


--- Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 01 ---
Hades: ...Such contempt, for your own father. But we are not finished here, yet.


--- Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 02 ---
Hades: ...Your youth provides you with a certain mindless strength. But, such power has its limits.


--- Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 03 ---
Hades: ...Now that we had our little warm-up, it is time that we began in earnest.


--- Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 04 ---
Hades: ...You strike at your own father. What choice does that leave me.


--- Lord Hades Next Stage Misc 05 ---
Hades: ...*Hmph*. All right, then, boy. You've stirred my anger suitably, by now.


--- Lord Hades Final Stage 01 ---
Hades: *Urgh*... no... I'm... not... finished... with you... *yet*!!


--- Lord Hades First Defeat ---
Hades: I... how... you.... Go. Go, then. *Go*!! Get out of here! Get out!
Zagreus: I told you that I would, Father. And I'm going to. Goodbye.
Hades: ...Wait. Wait, just... if you... if you find her. If you somehow find her? Tell her something for me, tell her... Tell her Cerberus is doing very well.
Zagreus: What? Wait. I don't think I owe you any favors, here. Though, answer me one question, and I'll give it some thought, how's that?
Hades: ...I know your question, boy. But, ask it anyway.
Zagreus: Persephone. My mother. Why did she leave?
Hades: ...I... urgh... blood and darkness...


--- Lord Hades Defeated 02 ---
Zagreus: You're not going to cooperate with me on this, are you? Even now, knowing Mother wants to see me again?
Hades: *Urgh*! Blast you... you shall ruin everything... with all your damnable questions!
Zagreus: Then, die, already. And get the hell out of my way.


--- Lord Hades Chaos Surface Quest Defeat 01 ---
Hades: ...Blast you, boy... we should have never sprung from Chaos... none of this...


--- Lord Hades Extreme Measures Defeat 01 ---
Hades: *Urgh*.... *<Gasp> *How... I... I went all out! And still...?


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 01 ---
Hades: Blast you, boy. You think you are superior to me? You are a fool.


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 02 ---
Hades: *Urgh...! *With your youth comes a certain strength, it seems.


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 03 ---
Hades: *Tsch... *I... I shall see you back at home.


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 04 ---
Hades: How? How is this possible, that this... *urgh!*


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 05 ---
Hades: *Ungh... *The world you seek out there... it's even crueler than the one you know.


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 06 ---
Hades: *Augh! *Why... I was much stronger once, than this...


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 07 ---
Hades: *Aah, blast*! That you of all my kin would be the one, to do this, to me....


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 08 ---
Hades: *Mmph*... No matter how many times you beat me... we're family. There's no escaping that.


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 09 ---
Hades: Again, you have defeated me, somehow. And yet...


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 10 ---
Hades: What shall it take... what shall it take for you to...


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 11 ---
Hades: *Ungh, *you... tell no one at the House. Do you hear me?


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 12 ---
Hades: *Rrngh*, you stubborn... you shrug off death as though it means nothing to you...!


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 13 ---
Hades: ...I shall keep coming back... the same as you...!


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 14 ---
Hades: You... you think that you're the only one... who shall keep fighting?


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 15 ---
Hades: I must admit... you've learned something. At some point, in all this.


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 16 ---
Hades: *Urgh*... were it not for all my wretched kin upon Olympus, you...


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 17 ---
Hades: *Rngh*, vanquished again... by my own fool kin....


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 18 ---
Hades: *Guh*! Boy, you speak none of this, to anyone!


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 19 ---
Hades: *Urgh*! How did... you accomplish this...?


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 20 ---
Hades: *Nrgh*! You cannot escape... none of us can.


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 21 ---
Hades: *Augh*... then, go, see what awaits you in this realm...


--- Lord Hades Misc Defeat 22 ---
Hades: *Gah*... I, fell to you, again, I... how...?


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 01 ---
Hades: *Gah*... you have your mother's perseverance. How is it that you got this strong?


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 02 ---
Hades: *Urngh*! It seems... I was no match for you, this time.


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 03 ---
Hades: *Augh*... I'm not as limber as I used to be, while you...?


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 04 ---
Hades: *Nngh*... for a student of Achilles... I fear that you surpass even his skill, by now...


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 05 ---
Hades: *Umphh*... you broke through every one of my defenses, once again...


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 06 ---
Hades: *Argh*... you bested me, I'll grant you, Zagreus...


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 07 ---
Hades: *Ungh*... Olympus gave you quite the edge against me, then...


--- Lord Hades Misc Post Ending Defeat 08 ---
Hades: *Grngh*... you owe this victory to all your relatives...


--- Hades First Meeting ---
Hades: Stupid boy. I told you nobody gets out of here, whether alive or dead. Though, how was your wanton ransacking of my domain?
Zagreus: Greetings, Father. My ransacking was a delight, thank you for asking. So, I'll just be on my way, again.
Hades: Be on your way, indeed. What do I care? You shall never reach the surface. Go, see for yourself.


--- Hades First Meeting Cont 1 ---
Hades: What is it, now? I've a mountain of infernal parchmentwork.


--- Hades First Meeting Cont 2 ---
Hades: Out of my sight, now, go.


--- Hades First Meeting B ---
Hades: To what do I owe the pleasure, boy? For I'm unaccustomed to being approached by you here in my House.
Zagreus: Oh, you know. Just thought I'd check in, see what you were up to. Parchmentwork going all right, I'm sure?
Hades: Oh yes, the parchmentwork is going splendidly. Would you care for some? There is no shortage of it, you see.


--- Hades Lounge Closed 01 ---
Zagreus: Father, what happened to the lounge? The only place for anyone to have a little fun around here, and you seal it shut.
Hades: Oh, I had little choice about that, boy. You see, after you fled the first time, Cerberus, why he was very much upset. Utterly tore the place to shreds. It's now under repair. All thanks to you.
Zagreus: You're really blaming me for not minding the dog while I was out, and while you all were here?
Hades: I lay the blame entirely upon you, yes. Who else? It's fortunate that Cerberus has calmed himself since then! Come to his senses, I should say. May you yet come to yours.


--- Hades About Ghost Admin 01 ---
Zagreus: Who's that sniveling shade to your immediate left, there, Father? Already found someone new to do the busywork. And here I thought I was utterly indispensable.
Hades: That shade, boy, is my newly designated contractor; one whose responsibility is to work on this House. Though, who shall pay for everything my subjects here demand, I do not know.
Zagreus: You're trying to guilt me into funding the exorbitant furnishings you desire.
Hades: Perhaps once we are finished with repairs for all the carnage you have sown throughout my realm, then we might finally have time for all the needed renovations that have piled up.


--- Hades About Ghost Admin 02 ---
Hades: You have been keeping our contractor rather busy, I must say. Commissioning these frivolous projects around the House with the wealth you wrest from my domain. What are you hoping to achieve?
Zagreus: Oh, you know, just giving back to the community. Figure if I'm to keep getting dragged back here it might as well be somewhat livable.
Hades: Livable! When last I checked, making the Underworld livable was not among our top priorities. Just remember, in your brazenness, whose House this is.


--- Hades About Ghost Admin 03 ---
Zagreus: There's quite a lot of renovating to be done, isn't there, Father. Your House Contractor there has shown a wide variety of pending jobs.
Hades: I've ordered Nyx to supervise that list. Entirely her problem, boy. And likely yours. How does it feel, knowing that your rampages create the need for so much maintenance?
Zagreus: Feels pretty good, now that you mention it. Keeps everybody occupied, no?


--- Hades About Office Backstory 01 ---
Zagreus: You know, Father! I must say ransacking your domain beats having to toil endlessly in the administrative chamber. Far less painful, really.
Hades: *Hah! *Is that your way of asking me for your old job back, boy? You were a scourge upon every administrative duty to which you were assigned.
Zagreus: Yes, please, Father, give me back my old, wretched job, won't you?
Hades: Privileges are *earned *not begged for, boy. Unless you plan to reimburse this House for all the income that we lost because of you, then you shall not so much as set foot in the administrative chamber, again.
Zagreus: How much is the reimbursement fee, anyway?
Hades: Whichever exorbitant amount the House Contractor has on record, now leave me be!


--- Hades About Office 01 ---
Hades: So help me, boy, I cannot fathom why you would have bought back the authority to enter the administrative chamber once again.
Zagreus: I knew you thought I'd never do it under any circumstances, Father. That seemed reason enough. Though, fear not, I've no plans to reapply for a position there.
Hades: That does alleviate a deeply rooted fear of mine, in fact. The scene you caused in your brief time there yet remains a widely talked-about event among the shades who toil for me still.


--- Hades About Shoulder Skulls 01 ---
Zagreus: Always wanted to ask you something, Father. Whose skull is that there on your shoulder? If it's not too personal.
Hades: I did not chronicle all Typhon's wretched offspring, boy. No one did. Some of them sit upon our shoulders now, lest we forget that things could easily have turned out rather differently, and much, much worse.
Zagreus: So these are just the remains of the spawn of the most hideous monstrosity of all time, which you and your brothers slew, got it. I guess putting the dead in their place is all part of the job. I can hardly imagine what it was like before you and the Olympians took charge.


--- Hades About Keepsake 01 ---
Hades: Be certain that you take appropriate precautions with the Sigil of the Dead that you now bear. Should some misfortune come to it through negligence, it cannot be replaced.
Zagreus: I can't imagine what I'd do without your blessing, Father! But, thank you again. I don't often inherit Fate-appointed honors, and will take good care of it. Though... what if the Olympians catch on? Wouldn't do for everybody knowing that you're aiding me even a little, right?
Hades: Correct. It would not do, at all. Fortunately, the power of the Unseen can remain well-hidden as it pleases. What is it your instructor always says?
Zagreus: ...Fear is for the weak?


--- Hades Allows Legendary Keepsakes 01 ---
Hades: Those Chthonic Companion things you have from Nyx, or whoever they ended up with... I know they have been benefiting you.
Zagreus: Yeah, well... I'm to attempt to escape this place by any means necessary, right? I figure if I can call on Olympus for aid, maybe some of my friends can help me in a pinch, as well.
Hades: Not what I mean. Some of your *friends *have been reluctant to engage against me during our scuffles on the surface. Know that I have authorized them to proceed, if necessary.
Zagreus: Wait, really? You're saying it's OK for your own loyal subjects to side against you up there? You won't take it out on them?
Hades: I consider it an expansion of their responsibilities. Now, go.


--- Hades About Zagreus Promotion 01 ---
Zagreus: So tell me, Father. Just how much did it hurt your soul knowing my face is up there on the Featured Houseservant Board, for all in the lounge to see?
Hades: Has it occurred to you that I, alone, have final say about whose countenance is shown up there? Although, others who shall not be named did put in a good word for you, repeatedly.
Zagreus: Blood and darkness... all my life I thought that board was a joke. But seeing my face up there... it felt good. Thanks, Father. Maybe it won't be the last time.


--- Hades About Sundial 01 ---
Hades: Indulge me for a moment, boy. Why bother to construct a sundial, there? Knowing full well it was my wish to have one installed. To demonstrate your awe-inspiring authority? Or to deny me the small pleasure of doing it myself?
Zagreus: Maybe a little of each? Or maybe you ought not second-guess my every motive and decision, constantly, searching for some sinister agenda that has yet to cross my mind?
Hades: *Pah! *I would have chosen an entirely different marble texture for it, anyway.


--- Hades Lounge Repaired 01 ---
Zagreus: Guess what, Father? The lounge is all tidied up. Your House Contractor there is quite efficient once you muster up the necessary funds. You should try it sometime!
Hades: Are you expecting words of thanks because you paid the contractor to fix a bit of devastation that you caused? I fear it shall take rather more than that.
Zagreus: What if I replaced every furnishing in this blasted place, would you treat me any better then?
Hades: I suppose, boy, that there's only one way to find out. Though I suggest you save yourself the trouble.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 01 ---
Hades: I see you've decided to come home. Changed your mind yet, or looking for more pain and suffering?
Zagreus: More pain and suffering, for sure. After all, you taught me to appreciate the finer things.
Hades: You keep telling yourself that, boy. But, mark you my words, sooner or later, this life that you have chosen for yourself shall teach you I was right.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 02 ---
Hades: Well that was quick. What news, boy, ready to give up, or no?
Zagreus: You'd like that, wouldn't you? Lucky I've got other family who believe in me.
Hades: Be careful whom you give your trust. My brothers frolic on Olympus while we work. While *I *work! You're just like them. No wonder they like you.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 03 ---
Hades: So, how did it go? How did you die ignobly this time, pray tell? Cerberus and I can't wait to hear the tale.
Zagreus: In that case, I'll spare you the details.
Hades: Fine. Your failure is quite easily imagined. How often it recurs! Almost as though my realm is built to keep you here. You, and every single soul that's ever lived. But, by all means, continue struggling.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 04 ---
Hades: Welcome home, boy. You're late for dinner... or, breakfast, or whatever blasted meal's next.
Zagreus: That's all right, Father. I'm not feeling very hungry at the moment.
Hades: ...I've asked repeatedly for the construction of a sundial, but every time, they tell me no, can you believe it? Your impertinence with me inspires all.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 04 B ---
Hades: Welcome home, boy. You're late for dinner... or, breakfast, or whatever blasted meal's next.
Zagreus: That's all right, Father. I'm not feeling very hungry at the moment.
Hades: ...I've asked repeatedly for the construction of a sundial, but every time, they tell me no, can you believe it?


--- Hades Misc Meeting 05 ---
Hades: Blood and darkness, but this place is falling apart... nobody works an honest day down here.
Zagreus: Father, everybody's dead. Give them a break.
Hades: What would you even know of honest work? At least the wretched dead yet honor me as Lord. I cannot say the same for you.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 06 ---
Hades: Have you yet satisfied your foolish urges? Perhaps a lashing from the Furies' whips would set you straight.
Zagreus: I had it out with them already, thanks.
Hades: Such nonsense. First you defy me openly, and now you lie. On my next meeting with the Furies, we'll have a word about all this, you rest assured.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 07 ---
Hades: Why, I can scarce believe my eyes, is that you, boy?! Cerberus, look who it is, he's back!
Storyteller: *Cerberus looks mournfully toward the Prince.*
Zagreus: No need to drag the dog into this, Father.
Hades: Anything you say to me, you say in front of Cerberus! You might even learn a thing or two from him of listening, and of obedience!


--- Hades Misc Meeting 08 ---
Hades: He's back already, Cerberus! Just as I indicated.
Zagreus: I'm standing right here, Father.
Hades: I'm sorry he disturbed your rest again, Cerberus, you've done a good job. The realm is well defended still, to the high standard that you set.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 09 ---
Hades: What did I tell you, boy? Ever wasteful of your time, and mine. How fares my Underworld, *hm*?
Zagreus: I don't know how you can stand it.
Hades: Well, at least some things are running smoothly still. Next you go to die again, do give the tortured souls out there my warm regards.


--- Hades Misc Meeting 10 ---
Hades: *Ah*, for shame, boy. I thought perhaps you'd finally made it out.
Zagreus: Really...? I mean, oh, wait, you're not serious. That famous sense of humor shining through.
Hades: I jest, of course, you'll never make it out; as I keep telling you to no avail. But you've gone farther than expected. So, who knows....


--- Hades Misc Meeting 11 ---
Hades: ...You've been gone a while...
Zagreus: I'm going to find Mother. No matter how long it takes me.
Hades: For the last time, you're not to speak about that woman in my House. You want to know of her so much, you go find her, indeed.


--- Hades Post Flashback 01 ---
Hades: I know that Nyx has been abetting you. You wish to take advantage of her pity? I care not. Her powers have their limits, anyway.
Zagreus: How can you... Nyx is the Night Itself, and can do as she pleases, isn't that correct, Father? You think I asked she get involved in all this business?
Hades: You, boy, have already dragged this entire household, not to mention my fool relatives, into this mess, which you've created. Which you dare call *business*.


--- Hades Post Flashback 02 ---
Zagreus: So, tell me something, Father, if you please. Since we're more candid lately in regard to matters of my birthright here, and all... did you and Mother... how to put this? Any brothers or sisters I should know about?
Hades: I thought I told you never to invoke her here! Be thankful that you have no blasted kin. You've such weak blood, and such a temperament... why, then, would you think I'd risk another, such as you?
Zagreus: Sure, that's fair enough, it's just not all such things occur as planned, as I am told. From tales of your brothers and so forth.
Hades: Oh, blast my brothers, and blast you, as well! All those who know me know I have no heir. You could not rise to the occasion if you tried! And, there is no one else. You've only me. And I have only you.


--- Hades About Orpheus Unlock Item 01 ---
Zagreus: You call my chambers a mess, look at your desk, Father! Whatever happened to your court musician, huh, where's his sentencing parchmentwork? Stuck in Tartarus, all because he stopped singing for you on command?
Hades: My desk is far more organized than *you*, boy! And if you're so concerned about our court musician, why don't you commute his sentence, yourself? Seeing as I haven't gotten around to it yet.
Zagreus: Sure, happy to oblige. I'll just ask the House Contractor since you're too busy.


--- Hades About Orpheus 01 ---
Hades: I understand you have attempted to persuade our court musician to resume his craft. That is among the relatively useful tasks to which you have applied yourself of late.
Zagreus: I can't be completely sure but, what you said just now I think contained some of the component pieces of a compliment?
Hades: I'm certain that your boasts and twists of words shall soon inspire him to greater acts of compositional superiority, one of these days or nights.


--- Hades About Orpheus Sings Again 02 ---
Hades: I had a feeling that our court musician would eventually come back to his senses and his talents, boy. Here, yet again, my intuitions were correct. Though, you appear a bit perturbed. Don't like the song? It's about *you*!
Zagreus: It says I'm really the bastard son of Zeus, but also indelibly connected to the god of wine, and how your parents tore me to pieces, giving rise to mortals, but that I'm always going to be stuck here.
Hades: You fill Orpheus' mind with nonsense, he produces nonsense. Nonsense I presume shall spread from this place far and wide, so everyone might know that I have nothing to do with you.
Zagreus: I'm not worried. Orpheus plays for a very small audience.


--- Hades About Eurydice 01 ---
Zagreus: Father, I met an oak nymph called Eurydice. You know her name, I think. Is it really true what happened between her and Orpheus? They say you almost let her out, so why not me?
Hades: *Pah! *Orpheus is a talented musician, and a fool. I knew he would never get his beloved wife out of here. There's no escape for her, or anyone, including you.
Zagreus: So you tricked him. Or maybe offered him a deal in bad faith. No matter. What's it going to take to waive the separation order between them?
Hades: That's non-negotiable, boy. Waiving a separation order! That's a veritable fortune in dues alone. Off the table. Now, go mind your own affairs, and leave the waiving and the ordering to me.


--- Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01 ---
Zagreus: Father, have you ever considered that Orpheus might be much better as a court musician if you permitted him to see his muse again?
Hades: I have considered many possibilities, boy. And I trust Orpheus considered many possibilities before he signed away his rights to see his so-called muse when once he invaded my realm!
Zagreus: So you're forcing him to stay here for eternity just because he signed a contract with you?
Hades: Contracts with me are binding! Until such time as they dig themselves out of the archives and tear themselves up! And I don't see that happening anytime soon.


--- Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 01 B ---
Zagreus: Father, let's say, hypothetically, that I could pay the dues to waive the separation order between Orpheus and Eurydice. Would you honor the new terms, or spitefully cheat me out of a fair deal?
Hades: I honor the terms of my commitments, boy. The rules we put in place are all that keep this Underworld in any semblance of a shape! But, what you ask is utterly absurd. The costs of processing a separation order are well beyond your means.


--- Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02 ---
Hades: You voided the contract with our court musician. Used your own authority against me.
Zagreus: So what if I did? Just gives him a bit of break from time to time. He's still your court musician, isn't he?
Hades: He is. And he knows better than to undermine me, I think. Out with you, then! I'll deal with your insubordination some other time.


--- Hades About Singers Reunion Quest 02 B ---
Hades: You voided the contract with our court musician. Used your own authority against me.
Zagreus: So what if I did? Just gives him a bit of break from time to time. He's still your court musician, isn't he?
Hades: He is. And he knows better than to undermine me, I think. Though, I suppose the Queen would take your side that he has paid his dues in full, by now...?


--- Hades About Sisyphus Liberation Quest 01 ---
Zagreus: Father, let me ask you something work-related, here. I know the shade called Sisyphus once wronged both you and Thanatos, and has since paid a heavy price. But don't the Fury Sisters now have better things to do than torture him?
Hades: You come to *me *to question how I allocate my resources? Preposterous. I care nothing for that wretched shade. That he is tortured for eternity is but a technicality resulting from his arrogance. The terms of his incarceration are long lost!
Zagreus: So then if I could somehow find those terms, then theoretically, I could grant him a pardon...
Hades: If you could somehow do your job, and enact miracles, then yes! You could do anything, then, I suppose. Including waste your time on those of his undeserving ilk.


--- Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01 ---
Hades: You altered one of my own pacts, without so much as seeking my consent... undoing terms that were agreed upon. Do you intend to undermine everything in this House, boy? Or only me?
Zagreus: Only you, Father. Good thing I've inherited some of your Fate-given authority, being your son and all. Otherwise some of your most loyal subjects would be bound by exploitive terms for eternity.
Hades: Terms that *they *chose, themselves! Terms to the benefit of this House. What if Achilles were to leave his post for the green pastures of Elysium, what then?
Zagreus: You could find a replacement? But it's a pointless question anyway, because he's here! He isn't leaving. He might even do better at his job, now that he has increased ability to step away from it.
Hades: A naive hope, at best. The more you step away from your responsibilities, the less you shall want anything to do with them.


--- Hades Run Progress 01 ---
Hades: Megaera tells me that you surpassed her while out there. How utterly embarrassing for her, to say the least.
Zagreus: I suppose you're going to punish her in some cruel fashion, then?
Hades: Oh, I've already seen to that, of course. You think she volunteered to deal with you? Nobody did. That's how ignoble a task it is.


--- Hades Run Progress 02 ---
Hades: Tell me something, boy, did you enjoy the searing heat of Asphodel? You must have thought that you'd be more resilient to it.
Zagreus: I'm open to a change of climate. Even if it gets a bit uncomfortable.
Hades: You know nothing of discomfort, yet. Making it out of Tartarus is nothing in comparison to what lies ahead for you.


--- Hades Run Progress 03 ---
Hades: I understand that you created quite a stir within Elysium. An all-out brawl within eternal paradise!
Zagreus: You call that paradise? It's just a bunch of shades bored out of their former skulls, itching for a chance to feel alive again.
Hades: What would you know of it! The greatest mortals have their every need fulfilled within that place. I dread to hear what they shall say of all of this.


--- Hades Run Progress 04 ---
Hades: Tell me something, boy, because my own set of ideas on the subject is beginning to run dry: What, exactly, is it going to take for you to understand that you're not leaving here?
Zagreus: Perhaps you ought to have me bound next to Prometheus, and have the dreaded Eagle peck my liver for eternity?
Hades: You would have me resort to such barbarity? Blast you, boy. Punishment is not the path to rehabilitation; it is for its own sake. I'd have expected all your trips through Tartarus to have taught you as much.


--- Hades Run Progress 05 ---
Hades: I'm truly sorry that he's troubled you again, Cerberus. I know how much you value resting here, and yet, I have no better means to bar the entry to our realm than you.
Zagreus: I thought you'd figured out by now that guilting me into abandoning my quest won't work. You're the one who should feel guilty, forcing Cerberus to block my path.
Hades: What would you know of it? Cerberus cannot be forced to do anything. He simply understands he has responsibilities.


--- Hades About Charon Fight 01 ---
Hades: *Ah*, verify something for me, here, boy. According to the latest reports... you attempted unsuccessfully to shoplift from Charon, himself? And were consequently slain? Utterly ignoble end, even for you.
Zagreus: *Erm*, I was *borrowing*, OK? Not shoplifting. Why didn't anybody ever tell me Charon was such a monster? I thought the boating mercantile thing made for a peaceful life.
Hades: You incur the wrath of ancient chthonic gods, and then are surprised to be destroyed by them? Have you learned nothing, after all this time?


--- Hades About Weapon Enchantments 01 ---
Hades: How are you finding my old trusty spear, then, *hm*? Or perhaps you have a preference for my brothers' and my sisters' former arms. Kept under lock and key, and yet, they're now in your possession, it would seem.
Zagreus: The weapons in the courtyard. Of course you know about them, by now. I stole them. Why not just take them from me? I'd be stuck.
Hades: The thought has long since crossed my mind. However, I'm not fool enough to tamper with those cursed things. They go where they please. They cannot be contained. Like you. Now, why don't you go entertain each other more?


--- Hades About Fury Sisters Union 01 ---
Zagreus: Megaera and her sisters ganged up on me that time. I didn't think anyone could talk her into working with Alecto and Tisiphone again. Or even be in the same chamber.
Hades: I can be quite persuasive under certain circumstances, boy. Though my advice to you, not that you'll take it, is not to discuss the matter openly. Megaera is a professional; but she has made her feelings on the matter clear.


--- Hades About Satyrs 01 ---
Hades: It is woefully infrequent that I've cause for this, but I do have to thank you, boy. You've culled the Satyrs and the vermin bringing ruin to our Temple, there! Blasted creatures multiply at an alarming rate.
Zagreus: They're not doing your bidding, yet they're every bit as bothersome as all your wretched servants I've met. I'm surprised you aren't getting along.
Hades: They are a plague upon this realm, although we have them well contained, for now. And once they are rightly dead, they tend to swear to me their fealty.


--- Hades About Charon 01 ---
Zagreus: Father, you always said the Olympians wanted nothing to do with our kind. But doesn't Charon work directly with Hermes? Maybe it's *you *who wants nothing to do with *them*.
Hades: I want nothing to do with them, correct. My hasty nephew assists Charon out of necessity, alone. Not even Thanatos is able to keep up with the rate at which mortals expire and must then cross our borders.
Zagreus: Want me to pitch in? Just give me your blessing and I'll head straight for the surface.
Hades: *Hahaha*, no. I think not, boy. You are born of this realm. The surface is a wind-swept waste. You don't know how good you have it here.


--- Hades About Mother 01 ---
Hades: She is gone, boy. She is gone. You are never going to locate her. I thought you would have come to that conclusion for yourself, by now. But apparently it must be said.
Zagreus: You mean Mother. How would you even know? You said reaching the surface was impossible as well, and I'm in striking distance.
Hades: This is my final warning to you, boy... to cease this mindless quest. Or else, the consequences shall be worse than what you have experienced thus far.


--- Hades About Throne 01 ---
Hades: Whatever you did to my blasted seat is of no consequence to me. From my vantage-point, I can't even see it! A foolish prank and waste of valuable resources, nothing more.
Zagreus: It's more for everybody else than you, Father. Think of it as a tribute to Cerberus! Besides, you really should think about changing up the look of this place from time to time. Keep things fresh!
Hades: The limitless work keeps things fresh enough as it is. Though if making aimless changes in this House is how you choose to spend your limitless time, I'll have no part of it.


--- Hades About Skelly 01 ---
Zagreus: Father, of all the skeletons and such in your direct employ... you wouldn't happen to have any here around the House, would you? Out in my courtyard, for example?
Hades: *Skeletons*! I'm sure they'll welcome you when next you visit Asphodel. You may not realize it, boy, but we have a certain standard of decency we uphold around here!


--- Hades About War 01 ---
Zagreus: You ever think of giving Thanatos a break, Father? He seems to have more than his fair share of work of late.
Hades: Blame the blasted mortals for perishing so easily, or blame Lord Ares, prior to accusing me. With their surface wars, not only do they kill each other readily, but also often subsequently perish from the consequences of it all!
Zagreus: What wars, what's going on up there? Why don't the other Olympians do something?
Hades: *Pah*! How should I know? The mortals are equipped to settle their petty differences by any number of means. We have to make room for them all sooner or later, regardless.


--- Hades About Minotaur 01 ---
Hades: So, you had a run-in with the Minotaur out in Elysium, did you? Perhaps the only soul within this realm more bull-headed than you.
Zagreus: How long have you been waiting to use that line, Father? Wouldn't put it past you to have sent the Bull of Minos to Elysium entirely so we could have this conversation now.
Hades: You give me too much credit, boy. The Minotaur resides where he resides because of an entirely different arrangement.
Zagreus: He's working for you, isn't he? You think he can stop me.
Hades: Most in Elysium jump at the opportunity to do my bidding. Not that you know what that is like. Now go, see how you fare against the bull.


--- Hades About Theseus 01 ---
Hades: How goes your heated rivalry against the greatest king of Athens lately, boy? Your battles with him and the Minotaur must be the talk of the Underworld of late.
Zagreus: Admit it, Father. Theseus was the only hero you were able to recruit to stand against me. All the while he gets to boast about being the champion. What, was Heracles too busy for the task?
Hades: Speak not to me of Heracles. You know these heroes by their deeds, not by their character. Heracles is fortunate he's in my brother's favor. Else he would be in Tartarus where he belongs. The mortal concept of what constitutes a hero is absurd.


--- Hades About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01 ---
Hades: I know what you did. Stay out of Nyx's affairs next time, boy. She is needed here! Not wallowing in the primordial dark.
Zagreus: You're just angry because some of us still want to have anything to do with their parents.
Hades: Parents, *pah*! You know nothing of what parents are capable of. Conspire all you like against my wishes, I care not. Get out.


--- Hades Run Cleared 01 ---
Hades: So you were able to dispatch my Hydra, boy. Right down to the last hateful head. It's an accomplishment I felt was certainly beyond your talent set. Though, here you are again, nevertheless.
Zagreus: You cheated me. There wasn't anywhere that I could go! I could have gone much farther. All the way to Mother!
Hades: You shall do no such thing. Besides, if you were any help to me, you'd know vast portions of my realm are presently still under renovation. You won't be getting farther than you have.
Zagreus: I can wait. You can't just keep this place on lockdown for eternity. The mortals up there wouldn't stand for it.
Hades: They have no patience, yes. The same as you. Then wait, with all the rest of them. It matters not to me. For I have other work to do.


--- Hades Run Cleared 01 Follow Up ---
Hades: Now you begone from here, get yourself killed some more for all I care.


--- Hades Run Cleared 02 ---
Hades: Well, boy. Word has reached me that you were able to dethrone the Champion of Elysium as well as his bull-headed companion. Tell me, how did you accomplish such a thing?
Zagreus: First, you tell me when I can get out of there. The path guarded by Theseus was sealed! Is there even a surface? Is the outside world all a lie?!
Hades: Ah, now you are asking the big questions! Comforting to see such growth of character. Well if there is an outside world, you shall not be seeing it for quite some time. You know why, don't you?
Zagreus: Ongoing Underworld renovations?
Hades: Ongoing Underworld renovations. Now go and let King Theseus drive that sharp spear of his into yourself some more, until such time. The mortals soon shall force me to reopen, and then what?


--- Hades Run Cleared 03 ---
Hades: You are late, boy! Have you any idea what time it is?
Zagreus: No. Wait, what? I just vanquished you in single combat, and that's all you have to say to me?
Hades: Vanquished *me*? *Hah, hahaha*, nonsense. Don't you think I would recall such an event?
Zagreus: You can't be serious. You're going to pretend as though it never happened?
Hades: Everything is as it always was. And so shall it be, until the Fates determine otherwise. Or until our ongoing Underworld renovations are finally complete. Whichever comes first.


--- Hades Run Cleared 03 C ---
Zagreus: So you're really not going to answer my question about Mother from the other time, until the Underworld renovations are complete?
Hades: I know not what you're going on about, there, boy. Although, my focus is entirely upon our renovations, yes. Perhaps someday or night when this place is in proper working order, I shall have more time for your insipid questions.


--- Hades After Persephone Meeting 01 ---
Hades: You are *late*, boy! Have you any idea what time it is?
Zagreus: No. Wait, what? I vanquished you in single combat and finally found Mother, and that's all you have to say to me?
Hades: *Hah, haha*! Nonsense. Don't you think I would recall such an event?
Zagreus: You can't be serious. You're going to pretend as though it never happened? She wants answers, same as I do. She demands you let me pass! Let me go to her again.
Hades: Silence! This discussion is over. I hardly think this is the time or place to indulge your overwrought imagination.


--- Hades After Persephone Meeting 01 B ---
Hades: I told you, boy. I told you! There's no escape from here. Learned that the hard way, then?
Zagreus: You could have told me more important things. Mother left because she never even knew I was alive. Thanks to you! She's got a lot of questions, herself, as you can probably imagine. I'm headed back to her. You going to cooperate?
Hades: *Hahaha*, nonsense! Listen to me: If you have any sense remaining in that head of yours, I caution you not to discuss this here and now.
Zagreus: Let me go. Let me find her. She demands it!


--- Hades After Persephone Meeting 02 ---
Zagreus: Quite a mess you've created, I must say, Father... after being of no help whatsoever when it comes to disentangling it all. Though, this isn't the place to talk, right?
Hades: No! It most certainly is not. Though, I take it it shall not be long before another of our private meetings, then.


--- Hades Run Cleared 03 B ---
Zagreus: Something the matter, there, Father? You seem a little quieter than usual. Dare I say even a little somber and remorseful, for some reason?
Hades: Silence, boy! And better yet, why don't you get out of my sight? I've more important things to do now than indulge your boastfulness. We'll have to catch up at some other place and time.


--- Hades About Underworld Renovations 01 ---
Zagreus: You know, Father, while I'm sure you don't appreciate all the distractions as of late, your ceaseless toil has had some noticeable effect. Is it my imagination, or are the ongoing Underworld renovations almost complete?
Hades: There you go, getting ahead of yourself, again. The final stages of renovation are some of the most vital! Second only to the initial planning. There's a great deal of important work ahead!
Zagreus: I wasn't saying it wasn't important, I was just saying maybe there's finally an end to it in sight. What are you going to do with all your spare time, then?


--- Hades About Shrine 01 ---
Zagreus: What's the giant pact posted out in the courtyard, Father? You offering me a job?
Hades: Perish the thought. It's so that all your toiling can be more painful, nothing more.
Zagreus: Why would I want my toiling to be more painful than it already is?
Hades: Who knows, boy, or better yet, who cares? To make the mortals up there worship you for all your labors? Go on, then, go get yourself dispatched some more, so I can make well certain that my realm can properly contain you.


--- Hades About Bounties 01 ---
Hades: My records indicate that you've collected earnings based on some of your accomplishments, there, boy. I suppose you need an income of your own, having decided to cut ties and all.
Zagreus: What, you mean the bounties that you've offered up to anybody capable of beating Meg and all your other guardians out there? Don't you think that puts a lot of undue pressure on them, knowing that you've turned them into targets?
Hades: They must do better than they have, else they shall be replaced. If they're to grow in their respective roles, they have to know their weaknesses. And so do I. That you collect the bounties for it matters not.
Zagreus: What about the bounties for vanquishing you? Who's your replacement going to be?


--- Hades About Bounties 01 B ---
Hades: My records indicate that you've collected earnings based on some of your accomplishments, there, boy. I suppose you need an income of your own, having decided to cut ties and all.
Zagreus: What, you mean the bounties that you've offered up to anybody capable of beating Meg and all your other guardians out there? Don't you think that puts a lot of undue pressure on them, knowing that you've turned them into targets?
Hades: They must do better than they have, else they shall be replaced. If they're to grow in their respective roles, they have to know their weaknesses. And so do I. That you collect the bounties for it matters not.
Zagreus: Be sure to add those to the list of words you'll eat someday.


--- Hades About Shrine 02 ---
Zagreus: Saw your new Pact of Punishment out in the courtyard, Father. Impressed that you could find a parchment large enough to fit all the unpleasant stipulations. So you're taking even harsher measures to contain me?
Hades: Whether you consent to the terms of the Pact is entirely up to you, boy. But, in all your comings and goings, it is important that we have full knowledge of which property is being carried from the premises.


--- Hades Shrine Progress 01 ---
Hades: You've taken more advantage of the Pact of Punishment than I would have expected, boy. I almost wish to commend you for doing such a thing.
Zagreus: Almost? I've been rampaging through the worst your realm has to offer. Causing you untold inconvenience and likely a fortune in repair costs. I thought you'd be upset.
Hades: Upset? Heavens, no. Through your repeated bumbling, you have revealed a number of shortcomings in our operations, which my underlings are busy working to address.
Zagreus: You know you sound especially despicable when you say *underlings*, don't you?
Hades: Don't let me keep you any longer, boy, go forth! Try to escape again. You're helping make the Underworld a better place.


--- Hades Shrine Progress 02 ---
Hades: Explain to me something: How did you do it? I mean the Pact. For all of the conditions it imposed... you still surpassed me. How?
Zagreus: Plenty of practice, regular exercise, a positive attitude, the blessings of assorted family members you don't like, and your discarded Titan-slaying weapons I suppose. Nothing special. Why do you ask?
Hades: To think that you would squander such a talent on frivolous pursuit. You do not even realize what you have achieved, do you.
Zagreus: Wait, wait wait wait wait, care to repeat that first part that you said back there? The *talent *part?
Hades: Would that you had a talent for listening. Begone for now.


--- Hades About Extreme Measures 01 ---
Hades: Back to your senses, then, boy? The Pact of Punishment is not something one ought to trifle with unknowingly, in case you've yet to notice.
Zagreus: Father... the Pact... you were so blasted strong. I had no idea! All those other times we fought... I can't believe that you were holding back. You were desperate to stop me, you could have!
Hades: We are bound by the Fates to this realm. It is ours, and we belong to it, in turn. And... I did not hold back against you. Rather... I had forgotten my old strength. Some of it since returned to me.
Zagreus: Must have been all our vicious battles to the death? Or maybe it's from Mother being back in your life?
Hades: Pointless to even ask. What motivates us is a complicated thing. But if you long to face me with the power I once held during my own youth... you have available to you the means.


--- Hades About Extreme Measures 02 ---
Hades: *Urgh*... come, get your gloating well out of the way, so I can get back to this parchmentwork. It piled up, in my prolonged absence!
Zagreus: Not here to gloat, Father. Well fought back there. I can't believe I got you.
Hades: ...Nor I. Next time, the Fates may not decide to favor you like that. If there shall be a next time.


--- Hades About Zeus 01 ---
Zagreus: Father... look, Lord Uncle Zeus, I've been in contact with him, and he wishes to make peace. He asked for me to tell you. To tell you he forgives you for... whatever happened.
Hades: My brother Zeus... forgives me? Zeus forgives *me*?! How dare that blasted little brat! His beard may be luxurious but he's as much a child as are you. Forgives me, bah!
Zagreus: What did you do...? What happened between you?
Hades: None of your business! Go on now and frolic with that Lord Uncle of yours, the both of them! And don't you ever speak of him to me again, you hear me?


--- Hades About Persephone 01 ---
Zagreus: Question for you, Father. The name *Kore *happen to mean anything to you, by any chance?
Hades: *What*, where did you...?! *Ahh*, the cold witch brought it up, did she? Never repeat that name again, not here, nor anywhere, you hear me, boy? Know only this: The one called by that name despised it even more than I.
Zagreus: So let's see. Demeter's daughter went missing. She wound up down here. I... happened. Mother left. Demeter, and everyone else on Olympus apparently, has no idea. That about right? Tell me what happened.
Hades: I'll tell you nothing! Keep meddling in matters that you cannot understand, and you'll incur the wrath of Olympus on all that you hold dear. And, know that it is not for *my *sake that I'm warning you.


--- Hades About Persephone 02 ---
Hades: What is it now? I see that sneering look upon your countenance, which must mean you have yet another one of your insipid questions, haven't you.
Zagreus: Oh, this one's not insipid in the slightest. Let me get this straight. My mother's Persephone. Her mother's Demeter, but her father... evidently was some farm-boy? My red blood comes from him? And my propensity to die I guess.
Hades: You blame your ancestors for your own weakness? You should be thankful you were born with immortality! Though, your meddlesome curiosity and constant need for affirmation must certainly be from your mortal side.
Zagreus: Then, Mother, did... she grow older with age? Is she just going to expire as the mortals do? With demigods I hear it can go either way.
Hades: I said never to speak of her, blast you! You said, yourself, she is the daughter of the goddess of seasons! Use your fool head, for once.


--- Hades About Demeter 01 ---
Zagreus: Greetings, Father. Ran into Lady Demeter out there, on my last outing. Or should I say, my grandmother? What's she to you, then, ex-mother-in-law? Source of abject terror? Hard keeping track. Our family's rather complicated.
Hades: Do not invoke her name inside my House, you hear me, boy? You do not know at all what she is like. Though I can see why you two hit it off. She hated her father. Though understandably, as he was worse even than mine. Even than yours.


--- Hades Post Ending 01 ---
Zagreus: Greetings, Father. So! I can just... head on out there again whenever I want? Don't need to stick to any rigid schedule?
Hades: Your unpredictability is one of your assets. Our defenses must always be on guard. So, yes: Go about your business as you best see fit!
Zagreus: And the Olympians are going to keep helping me, thinking I'm trying to get away from you, to *them*. We can't keep this up with them forever, you know.


--- Hades Post Ending 02 ---
Hades: Tell me something, boy... Zagreus... why did you do all this? Return the Queen. Go to such lengths. At a certain point... you must have learned the way I felt about her. Yet still you persisted. If I were you... I'd not have done me any favors.
Zagreus: I didn't often stop to give it much thought. I just knew I needed to find her... and then as soon as I did, I knew I needed her in my life. In other words, doing you any favors was never a priority, Father. Just ended up that way, I guess.
Hades: ...I see. I appreciate your candor. Nevertheless... I thank you. I do not know how you accomplished what you did, but know that I am grateful for the outcome. Even if I fail to act like it, much of the time.


--- Hades Post Ending 03 ---
Zagreus: Say, Father... back when you drew lots with your brothers, and wound up with the Underworld, rather than the heavens or the seas... which would you have claimed, if the choice was yours?
Hades: I do not deal in hypotheticals, boy. Each realm has its host of unenviable problems. You have never experienced the cold and sopping sea, or the blinding heights of Olympus. I have. And I assure you, you're not missing much.
Zagreus: Didn't you try to leave the Underworld, yourself, at some point? You once gave me that impression. I always thought it was because you hated it here.
Hades: I hate not having any choice. Enjoy the freedoms that you have. As you grow long in years, you gain more burdens and responsibilities, until they bind you.


--- Hades Post Ending 04 ---
Zagreus: Father, all these shades... aren't they going to let on that Mother's back? What if word spreads... and the Olympians find out?
Hades: You are so well-accustomed to defying me that you forget there are no others, either living or dead, who would so dare. *None *in this House shall speak of this until we are prepared to make any announcements, on our own terms.


--- Hades Reveals Badge Seller 01 ---
Hades: Regarding your responsibilities: Our Resources Director is available to you. In my private quarters. Normally, it would be I, alone, transferring excess resources back into our realm.
Zagreus: The fabled Resources Director! So, now I get to give away the hard-earned resources I've painstakingly gathered over time?
Hades: You get to do precisely that. It is not necessary that you do. But if you wish to rise above your current station, you shall do it.
Zagreus: What's the point in rising above my current station? I thought our work was to be done in secrecy.
Hades: It is. There is no point but pride. And pride is dangerous. Do what you will. I care not, as long as everything gets adequately done.


--- Hades Reveals Badge Seller 01 B ---
Hades: Regarding your responsibilities: Our Resources Director is available to you. In the administrative chamber. Normally, it would be I, alone, transferring excess resources back into our realm.
Zagreus: The fabled Resources Director! So, now I get to give away the hard-earned resources I've painstakingly gathered over time?
Hades: You get to do precisely that. It is not necessary that you do. But if you wish to rise above your current station, you shall do it.
Zagreus: What's the point in rising above my current station? I thought our work was to be done in secrecy.
Hades: It is. There is no point but pride. And pride is dangerous. Do what you will. I care not, as long as everything gets adequately done.


--- Hades About Badge Seller Progress 01 ---
Hades: Briefly, now, boy: Our Resources Director informs me you've advanced in rank. Commendable. That's all.


--- Hades About Badge Seller Progress 02 ---
Hades: You are advancing through the ranks of your position, and returning to our realm the vast resources you have claimed. As well you ought. Carry on.


--- Hades About Badge Seller Progress 03 ---
Hades: We cannot speak of this, except... *Unseen One*... the highest ranking that we can bestow. I never once imagined that you could achieve that rank, yourself. Or any rank of note.
Zagreus: You always thought too little of me, Father. Though, thank you for taking note of that. I figured I ought to give back to the realm that made me what I am.
Hades: Yes. For this is the only world we know.


--- Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 A ---
Zagreus: Father... all this stuff with the Olympians... will you just tell me what's going on, for once? How did Mother come to join you here? What's your problem with Uncle Zeus?
Hades: I thought she already told you...! *Urgh*. Come with me. Now.
Hades: ...Swear to me that you shall never repeat what you are about to hear. Swear it!
Zagreus: All right, all right, I swear. I swear, in your own name, I'll keep what you're about to say between us.... So?
Hades: So... you had it mostly right, before. After I inherited the Underworld... your Uncle Zeus felt sympathy for me, he says. Your mother, he knew she was unhappy on Olympus. And... he knew I was drawn to her. So what did he do? He brought her here. Gave her to me as a *gift*!
Zagreus: You weren't expecting a gift like that. But she didn't want to return to Olympus, and you liked her, so you didn't send her away. And you're angry with Zeus for putting you in that position? Cut ties with him?
Hades: *Yes*!! The blasted fool, with all his flights of fancy! He does whatever he wants! He could have achieved a similar outcome in a limitless number of reasonable ways... rather than resort to what was tantamount to kidnapping! Even *if *she wanted to leave!
Zagreus: And now if Demeter and the others found all this out, you and Mother... even Zeus would be in a bad spot, wouldn't he? He must have a temper on him to match yours.
Hades: You know nothing of tempers if mine is your frame of reference, Zagreus. Now, enough of this! You know the rest. Remember your oath.


--- Hades About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 ---
Hades: One thing, before you depart again, boy. Until the Queen's intentions with Olympus come to pass... not a word to anyone about her presence, here. Do you understand?
Zagreus: I do. But she won't have to hide forever.


--- Hades Post Epilogue 01 ---
Zagreus: So, now that the festivities are over with, it's back to work like this, the same as ever?
Hades: Do you have any idea what happens when you announce the Underworld has a Queen, boy? *Urgh, damn it*! *Zagreus*, I mean. You become inundated with well-wishes from every blasted shade that wants something.
Zagreus: You're responding to well-wishes? *Aw. *Don't you think some of your subjects are sincerely happy for you?


--- Hades Post Epilogue 02 ---
Zagreus: I never stopped to think about why pomegranates grew here in the Underworld. Mother's doing from before, then? And all that stuff she told the Olympians, about how they bind you to this place... it's all nonsense?
Hades: You know full well that the pomegranates in my realm hold a certain power beyond the tartness of their taste, boy. The Queen... she has a way with plants, you see. A bit of her own mother's gift, applied more sensibly.
Zagreus: You kept them growing all this time... flourishing, even, because of her.


--- Hades Post Epilogue 03 A ---
Zagreus: So, what happened, when Mother first arrived, if I may ask? Some of your residents seem to remember the Queen from before. Yet the Olympians just never found out?
Hades: They had no jurisdiction here. No knowledge of our goings-on. Well, Hermes did, perhaps, but in a very limited capacity. As far as anybody knew beyond this realm... our Queen was Nyx. Ask nothing more of this.


--- Hades About Persephone Leaves To Olympus 01 ---
Zagreus: Father... how are you doing without Mother around? Will she be all right, on Olympus?
Hades: Clearly she is more than capable of handling herself. And we here have been well accustomed to not having her about.
Zagreus: So everything's back to normal, then? That sounds lovely.
Hades: Nothing is normal, anymore. Besides! She shall return. Knowing that she shall return, is that not sufficient for you? Be patient, for once.


--- Hades About Persephone Returns From Olympus 01 ---
Zagreus: It's good to see Mother's back. Not that I was too concerned, but... I was definitely a little concerned.
Hades: I shared in that particular concern, and yes... it is good the Queen has once again returned. And she shall have to depart again before we know it, so cherish your time with her, boy!


--- Hades Post Epilogue 03 ---
Hades: Tell me, in brief, boy. Our own upon Olympus... are they continuing to aid you as expected?
Zagreus: Still showing up and lending their support. I think some of them are a little disappointed I'm not planning to come join them, though... I think they understand now that they owe the Underworld a debt. We all have to do our part, looking after the mortals. Whether alive or dead.
Hades: Indeed. I half-expected they would disappoint. Abandon you to toil on your own. At least thus far they've honored their commitment, then.


--- Hades Post Epilogue 04 ---
Zagreus: So, are you maintaining better contact now with Uncle Zeus, Uncle Poseidon, and the rest? Oh, and... is it all right for me to speak about them here?
Hades: *Urgh*... I'm certain the superficial messages we have exchanged shall taper off, with time. We have always been apart, irrespective of the distance separating us. I know Zeus is content with your mother's version of events. Thus we are at peace, for now.
Zagreus: Wait, what do you mean, *for now*?
Hades: I mean only that our family is prone to causing problems for itself. Never content to leave things well enough alone. But if we have little to do with them... their quarrels, all their nonsense on Olympus... it should be of no consequence.


--- Hades Post Epilogue 05 ---
Hades: The latest reports indicate that mortals are fully twice as fearful of ending up in Tartarus as in our last evaluation period, thanks to the destruction you have caused. You are an unseen power in the Underworld. Commendable.
Zagreus: Commendable, me? An *unseen power*, huh. Surprised you're giving me the credit, Father.
Hades: I give credit where it's due. But the mortals? They know nothing of what transpires here. Only rumblings we permit to escape our realm... rumblings that reinforce their deepest fears about what shall transpire after their demise.
Zagreus: So the more havoc I wreak in the Underworld, the more mortals hear about all the unpleasantness, and... it makes them fearful of this place? If more of them lead upstanding lives, it'll keep Tartarus from overflowing, I guess.


--- Hades Chat 01 ---
Hades: Whatever you may wish to say, I do not wish to hear it.


--- Hades Chat 02 ---
Hades: You're interrupting me during my time at work.


--- Hades Chat 03 ---
Hades: I think I've heard more than enough from you lately.


--- Hades Chat 04 ---
Hades: You're willfully wasting my time, aren't you.


--- Hades Chat 05 ---
Hades: Go, get out. Don't let me stop you.


--- Hades Chat 06 ---
Hades: Shouldn't you be getting skewered by the dead?


--- Hades Chat 07 ---
Hades: Go to your room, or anywhere but here.


--- Hades Chat 08 ---
Hades: Blood and darkness, what is it with you?


--- Hades Chat 09 ---
Hades: Have you come up with more impertinence to spout at me?


--- Hades Chat 10 ---
Hades: I'll not be bothered with your disrespect.


--- Hades Chat 11 ---
Hades: Has it occurred to you that I'm preoccupied?


--- Hades Chat 12 ---
Hades: I am uninterested in conversing with you, boy.


--- Hades Chat 13 ---
Hades: Your presence is no longer welcome here.


--- Hades Chat 14 ---
Hades: How possibly could I have given the impression that I wished to talk?


--- Hades Chat 15 ---
Hades: You realize just how much property of mine you have defaced?


--- Hades Chat 16 ---
Hades: Fail all you like, you're never getting out of here.


--- Hades Chat 17 ---
Hades: You'll learn your place, the hard way, evidently.


--- Hades Chat 18 ---
Hades: To suffer such indignity, from my own kin.


--- Hades Chat 19 ---
Hades: Such foolishness as yours I scarce can comprehend.


--- Hades Chat 20 ---
Hades: We've nothing left now to discuss between us.


--- Hades Chat 22 ---
Hades: Have I mentioned that you're never getting out of here?


--- Hades Chat 23 ---
Hades: You're here to stay, boy. All of us are.


--- Hades Chat 24 ---
Hades: I'm busy now, as you can plainly see.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 01 ---
Hades: Blasted parchmentwork, it never goes away.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 02 ---
Hades: Your recent efforts have proved useful to this place.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 03 ---
Hades: Go instill some fear in those wretches out there, would you?


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 04 ---
Hades: He's back again, Cerberus! I'll try not to keep him for as long, next time.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 05 ---
Hades: Doubtless I shall get you for that one next time.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 06 ---
Hades: Another satyr outbreak to look out for next you venture there...


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 07 ---
Hades: Be certain to give your regards to your mother as well!


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 08 ---
Hades: Repairs for all the carnage that you sowed are already underway.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 09 ---
Hades: What else can we do to contain you, I wonder...


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 10 ---
Hades: I have some catching up to do, as you can see.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 11 ---
Hades: Ah, we ought to reconvene the court now, I suppose.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 12 ---
Hades: As you can see, I must attend to all this parchmentwork.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 13 ---
Hades: I must say, you made a hollow mockery of Theseus that time.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 14 ---
Hades: Our security efforts in Asphodel are evidently lacking.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 15 ---
Hades: Go rest yourself if need be. Though the Underworld is ready when you are.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 16 ---
Hades: Against my better judgment, I went easier on you that time.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 17 ---
Hades: Thus starts and ends our brief exchange of pleasantries.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 18 ---
Hades: Continue to perform your duties as you have.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 19 ---
Hades: Cerberus there was anticipating your return.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 20 ---
Hades: Your mother expected this most recent result of yours.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 21 ---
Hades: Do I appear as though I've time for conversation, boy?


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 22 ---
Hades: Let us discuss your work performance at some other time.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 23 ---
Hades: Your infamy throughout Elysium has only grown.


--- Hades Post Ending Chat 24 ---
Hades: I must admit... that was a job well done back there.


--- Hades Gift 01 ---
Zagreus: Hey, uh, Father. I thought, maybe, you know, here.
Hades: Where did you get this...? You think you can butter me up with such trifles? Give me that, and then get out of here.


--- Hades Gift 01 B ---
Zagreus: Hey, uh, Father. I thought, maybe, you know, here.
Hades: You owe me nothing, certainly not this. And I've nothing to give you in exchange. But fine, I'll honor our custom. Give it here.


--- Hades Gift 02 ---
Zagreus: *Erm*, Father... I know we can't exactly change the past, but we can try to move forward. Look, I know I'm not even supposed to have this stuff, but everyone likes it, won't you try it, at least? Here, take it, either way.
Hades: *Hrm*. I... can dispose of this properly. Speaking of disposal... I've no further need for this, here, so... rid me of it, why don't you? On your way out.


--- Hades Gift 03 ---
Zagreus: More Nectar for the old disposal service, Father, if you don't mind. Come on, you must have tried the stuff, at least in the days before you were here! Didn't you ever enjoy yourself, at any point?
Hades: I don't require beverages in order to enjoy myself, boy. Unlike so many of your kin upon their mountain. Yet this blasted substance somehow finds its way to my domain. Then, fine! You wish for the customs here to be more akin to Olympus, why not?


--- Hades Gift 04 ---
Zagreus: Have another bottle, why don't you, Father? Not like it's going to change anything between us, right? All the Nectar in the Underworld can't change what's already happened. Or change yourself.
Hades: *Hrm*. You're probably correct. You must think it is my age that makes me obstinate. Unable to change my nature. But I have always been inflexible. You think I'm proud of it? You call me *'Father' *like it's an insult. I deserve the title only as a technicality, I know.
Zagreus: You could start being a better father at any point. There's no one stopping you but you.
Hades: Yes, well... unfortunately, I am a significant impediment. You should be well aware of that. *You *were able to stop me. I have thus far been unable to do so...


--- Hades Gift 05 ---
Hades: Enough of this, boy! Even mortals know better. I don't want your Nectar, or Ambrosia, or whichever offerings. You owe me no such thing, and I shall not accept it any longer. In fact, here... you shall take all of it back!
Zagreus: Why? It's just Nectar, Father, lighten up. I get that you're surly about everything, but please at least try toward decency with me! If not for me, then for Mother.
Hades: How dare you lecture me? I mean... *urgh*... look. As you told me yourself... there's no changing what already transpired. And our memories are warnings. When you have lived as long as I have... you come to understand your weaknesses.
Zagreus: What are you getting at? You're just going to give up, stick with what's comfortable for you instead of making any real effort at making peace with your son?
Hades: *Rngh*. Listen to me. My attempts at making peace are going to be rather subtle for your tastes. I cannot change the past. And there is only so much I can do about the future. I tell you this because... I shall not lie to you again. That much, I swear.


--- Hades Flashback Day Night Job 01 ---
Hades: Well? What is the latest explanation for your tardiness? Lost track of time admiring the courtyard view? Perhaps you were recuperating from your martial training. Achilles is not prone to holding back.
Zagreus: I... I'm sorry, Father, I just overslept. I must have overslept. How am I even supposed to know exactly when to be here, I mean, every moment every day and night, here, it's all the same!
Hades: It's *not *at all the same! The hue of Ixion's green light takes on an obviously lighter hue when it is time! You're an embarrassment not just to me, here, boy, but to this entire operation. Now get back to work!


--- Hades Flashback Day Night Job 02 ---
Hades: Not only were you late, again... but then you also failed to perform even the simplest tasks that I had asked, repeatedly, that you complete. How many chances do you need at this? I am too lenient with you.
Zagreus: Too lenient? Instead of lambasting me nonstop, have you considered, maybe, training me some more to do this fascinating work to your satisfaction? You'll forgive me if I didn't memorize every laborious detail the last time you performed your monologue about how all this works.
Hades: *Excuse me*?! If I am not mistaken, you're deflecting your incompetence toward *me*? As though the Goddess of Wisdom herself has come to aid you in your time of need! I could replace you here and now with any number of simple shades, hungry to work here!
Zagreus: Then why don't you?! I don't want any of this. I'm not the one who drew the short lot with your brothers and got stuck here forever!! Why am I having to do this senseless parchment-pushing for you?
Hades: Why are you stuck? You're not. You're *fired*! I was wrong to think you were prepared to take on any responsibility at all. And, don't you ever invoke your uncles here again. Or I'll have you cast into the lowest pits of Tartarus. Now, get out of my administration, and my sight!


--- Achilles With Hades 01 ---
Achilles: ...You asked I train him, Master. Prepare him for life's labors. You ordered it! Now you admonish me?
Hades: Be careful of your tone and temper, Shade. You are in my employ. You could be wandering the pastures of Elysium again instead. Or lesser planes, if I so choose.
Achilles: ...What would you have me do?
Hades: I shall be giving it some thought. Until then, you just watch that hall. And watch yourself, as well.


--- Achilles With Hades About Myrmidon Reunion Quest 01 ---
Hades: ...I understand the terms of your employment have been altered in my name, Shade. Be grateful that you lack the standing for such changes to require my personal approval. Though you remain in my employ, correct?
Achilles: As far as I'm aware, yes, Master. I'm sworn eternally here to this House, except... it seems I'm now at liberty to see Elysium, from time to time. While off duty, of course.
Hades: How lenient they make these pacts, today. You are off duty now, is that not so? Go, then, take advantage of the added benefit.


--- Nyx With Hades 01 ---
Hades: ...You are not to aid him in these matters, Nyx; his foolishness is to be scorned and reprimanded, not indulged. Do we have an understanding?
Nyx: We have an understanding, Hades, yes. He is your own son, after all, and therefore your responsibility. I, in turn, have my commitments to this realm, and to this House. You have aided me in them, so I remain, as ever, in your debt.
Hades: It is not necessary to remind me. Surely all those who once defied my brothers and myself would much prefer a post within my House over eternity within the lowest depths of Tartarus. Not that the darkness there would trouble you.


--- Nyx With Hades 02 ---
Hades: ...It is plain to me that you are helping him; in spite of my insistence you do not. What do you expect that I should do about this, Nyx? What would you do, in my position? Deception, in my very house and home...! Answer me.
Nyx: Hades, my relationship with him remains unchanged. It is the very same relationship from when you first requested I take care of him. He has my full support, and always shall. You must know this. He wishes now to leave. I shall make no attempt to stop him.
Hades: *Tsch*. What good is any one of you? He's not even your son; and yet you coddle him. You know as well as I that he cannot succeed. You fill his mind with harmful delusions. If that is what you want for him, then, please! Proceed at pace.


--- Nyx With Hades 03 ---
Hades: *Olympus knows of him*?! Bestowing on him all their worthless blessings, here, within my realm! *Our *realm! Explain to me how, exactly, this is possible, Nyx. Either your limitless power has considerably waned, or you are up to something.
Nyx: Do not question my power, Hades. Your son was bound to be discovered the closer he came to the surface. The Olympians are pleased to know they have a distant relative, and bid him welcome to their mountain. That is all. Their influence is very limited.
Hades: Blood and darkness! Do not speak to me about their *influence*! I've seen their influence firsthand. You've made a foolish mistake.
Nyx: You would speak to me of foolish mistakes? You cannot change the course that has been set. Try all you like.


--- Nyx With Hades 04 ---
Hades: What now, Nyx? Do you realize the danger you have put her in? You claim to care for her, but now you threaten to expose her, to *them*!
Nyx: Hades. When have I even once been unaware of precisely what I mean to do? I shall bring no harm to the Queen, and neither shall your son.
Zagreus: Harm to the Queen, wait... what are you talking about?
Nyx: Child! Zagreus. Do you intend to betray the presence of your birthmother to the Olympians?
Zagreus: No! Of course not. She... seems content to be all on her own.
Hades: You take his word for it? How can you trust him not to ruin everything?
Nyx: Precisely how I trusted him to get us to this point.


--- Nyx With Hades 05 ---
Hades: ...What I attempt to tell you, Nyx, is I am grateful. For our long-standing collaboration, here. My rule was thrust upon you and your kin. By all rights, you ought have undermined my every move. I often thought you would. Yet once Olympus and I severed ties... you stood by me still.
Nyx: I am the Night Itself, as you well know, Hades. As I declared to you when first we met: I shall stand by your side, so long as you remain the fate-appointed ruler of this realm.
Hades: I shall require no additional reminders. Know, in turn, that I shall always oversee this realm to the full extent of my ability.


--- Hypnos With Hades 01 ---
Hades: ...You're late with your report, Hypnos. Again. Again! The dead of course can wait, but I'm less patient. Now, explain yourself to me.
Hypnos: *Oh*! Well, let's see, I woke up, I don't know what time it was, and I made sure that every shade had been accounted for, just like I always do, except I couldn't find my list at first, can you believe it? I thought maybe my brother played a little prank, and so...
Hades: Get to the blasted point already, I don't have all day! Or night. *Urgh*! Your report, where is it?
Hypnos: Sure I was just getting to it, Master! My list, I found it over by the lounge, it was inside, but I am not the one who put it there, no sir! So I've been making positively sure it's not been tampered with, that it has everybody's name, cause of death, place of birth, former body weight, any previous allergies or medications...
Hades: *Enough*!! Blood and darkness, that's enough from you, just... see to it the ledger of the dead is accurate, and get back to your post. *Ugh*, would that you could be more like your brother.


--- Hypnos With Hades 02 ---
Hades: ...Your reports have been much more punctual of late, Hypnos. That is to be expected. However... the illustrated edges... a clever detail. Ensures certain reports are easily procured from a stack of parchment.
Hypnos: Oh, *thanks*, Master, glad you like those! Ever since Thanatos made pretty clear to me I was about to lose my job, I started keeping a list of my *own *tasks, which I sort through each day, deciding on priority, estimating time to completion, cost-benefit analysis...
Hades: Yes, well. Certainly, then, you have a number of such tasks requiring your attention. Continue working diligently, then.


--- Hypnos With Hades 03 ---
Hypnos: Master, I just can't thank you enough for putting my picture on the board there in the lounge! I heard it's a good picture! I haven't had time to see it yet, but I am going to, it's on the list!
Hades: Hypnos... that shall be all. Lest I rescind your commendation and cast you out of here.
Hypnos: ....Um, could you say all that again with smaller words, Master, because I thought it maybe sounded kind of *bad*?


--- Thanatos With Hades 01 ---
Hades: Such tardiness is oft to be expected from your brother, but from you, Thanatos? You're practically the god of punctuality.
Thanatos: My lord, I apologize sincerely for the lapse in my performance as of late. I think my duties following the recent war above took more of a toll from me than I expected.
Hades: Thanatos, even we gods require rest from time to time. Someday we might get it around here, once this accursed House is well in order, finally. Until then, I appreciate your diligence. Do not overextend yourself.
Thanatos: Thank you, my lord. I am at your service. I'll be getting back to my assignment now.


--- Thanatos With Hades 02 ---
Hades: ...You have been rather slow about your duties, lately, Thanatos. And I'm receiving incident reports from Tartarus involving *you*. Remember your responsibilities. And, remember, *I am watching you*. Now, get out of my sight.


--- Thanatos With Hades 03 ---
Hades: You've been abetting him, Thanatos. Behind my back! Betrayal. I would ask you *why*. Well?
Thanatos: My lord, he and I... please. Go lock me up in Tartarus, or deal whichever justice you see fit, but... my loyalty is not subject to change. And I cannot stand by and watch you fight. The matter between you and Zagreus... there has to be some resolution, here.
Hades: You dare to lecture me? *Tsch*. My loyal subjects are too few of late, I think. This is *your *realm, not mine; I'll not cast you into that wretched pit. It's not like I have someone to replace you here, besides. Now then, begone.
Thanatos: I'm deeply sorry, lord...


--- Thanatos With Hades 04 ---
Thanatos: You wished to see me once again, my lord? It's been... a while since I had an audience with you.
Hades: It has. The last time, what was it you said? That there must be some resolution to the *matter*, as you called it, with my son? Well it is settled, now. Isn't it, boy?
Zagreus: I mean, you're still trying just as hard as ever to prevent me from escaping past the threshold of your realm, so, I don't know if I'd exactly call the matter *settled*. But... it does feel different, now.
Hades: And so you see... I would continue in our mutual good graces, if you please. This House can only function if the upper management is in accord. What do you say?
Thanatos: I say, you honor me, my lord. I appreciate you telling me, yourself. And I concur that, for the good of all the Underworld, it is imperative that each of us continue to perform at our full strength.
Hades: Then, as you were. Dismissed.


--- Dusa With Hades 01 ---
Hades: ...Would that all my subjects exhibited such promptness. Your report, then, if you please, Dusa?
Dusa: Sir! The office currently is running smoothly, sir! Lounge attendance is up by twenty-eight percent, with customer satisfaction ratings in the eightieth percentile. No issues to report at this time.
Hades: See that we achieve *thirty *percent before the turn of the aeon, Chief Custodian. Other than that... a satisfactory report. Now, carry on.


--- Orpheus With Hades 01 ---
Orpheus: ...You called upon your humble court musician, as I understand, Lord Hades sir? Referring to myself of course?
Hades: Well, Orpheus... if you're quite finished with your little stint within the depths of Tartarus, I'd like to ask again: Play us a song, already. Or else next time I'll not be quite so charitable with your punishment.
Orpheus: Oh, that. I must apologize, again, Lord Hades sir. For I'm afraid that I've no wish to sing as yet. In spite of your persuasiveness even. And, that, um, is my final word upon the subject. At this time.
Hades: Is that so...? Why, then, I'll go ahead and wait. I've all the patience in the world.


--- Orpheus With Hades 02 ---
Hades: Help me to understand something here, Orpheus. Why do I bother keeping such a worthless shadow of a court musician in my House? You prattle ceaselessly, yet I can't get even a single note out of you?
Orpheus: If I may be so bold, my lord? Perhaps the merest sight of me still stirs in you a memory of my performances of yore. It gladdens me you used to like my songs.
Hades: I used to tolerate your insolence. We're finished here. You find your voice. Immediately! You have one hundred years, and not a moment more.


--- Orpheus With Hades 03 ---
Hades: Finally returned to your senses, haven't you, Orpheus. A court musician who refused to sing! Such nonsense. I trust there shall be no more insubordination from you, moving forward?
Orpheus: I'm gladdened that my songs yet stir your soul, my lord. But, I have to confess my choice to sing again was motivated largely by the Prince. And by my muse, of course.
Hades: Still going on about your so-called muse, I see. You had your chance with Eurydice. You squandered it. And now you're here; a deal is a deal. I expect you to comply with your end of our agreement.


--- Orpheus With Hades 04 ---
Orpheus: ...I'm pleased to know my new, more flexible arrangement remains to your satisfaction, still, my lord. I must admit I feared that my departure would result once more in a protracted stay within the pits of Tartarus.
Hades: Don't give me such ideas, Orpheus! Instead, you go about your business, there, and play your blasted songs when circumstances call for it.
Orpheus: I shall be happy to oblige, my lord. Eurydice and I are grateful for your magnanimity.


--- Megaera With Hades 01 ---
Hades: ...Make certain of it, Megaera. I am finding, lately, that the help within this House is much more lacking than it used to be. I trust that you shall set it back on course.
Megaera: ...If that is your will, Lord Hades, then it will be done. To the fullest limits of my capability.


--- Megaera With Hades 02 ---
Megaera: ...Give me another chance, Lord Hades. I can do better. Don't... bring them here.
Hades: It is already too late for that, Megaera. They have been notified and are en route to Tartarus even as we speak.
Megaera: You know what they're like. They are best left to their specific tasks. Not this.
Hades: Megaera, trust me when I say I know the feeling all too well. However, surely, in your ingenuity, you may yet find a way to get your sisters to see eye to eye.


--- Megaera With Hades 03 ---
Megaera: ...I cannot work with them, Lord Hades. Please. They don't respect my words, or even listen.
Hades: *Enough*! Besides, Megaera, this is not your failing. It is mine. I must attend to these affairs more actively.
Megaera: ...I've often tried, but never to a satisfactory result. You're asking the impossible of me.
Hades: I am not asking, Megaera.


--- Megaera With Hades 04 ---
Megaera: ...But, I don't understand, Lord Hades. I have fallen to him countless times. How can this be...?
Hades: You and your sisters have protected Tartarus unerringly. The Prince has proven uncontainable. The fault is mine, not yours. Your duty to this realm must be commended.
Megaera: You honor me... I have done nothing to deserve this. There must be something more that I can do?
Hades: There is, and isn't, Megaera. I ask only that you remain committed to this realm. Bar passage in and out of Tartarus. And, if the Prince continues to show up... you give him hell.
Megaera: Lord Hades, it will be my pleasure, sir.


--- Olympian Reunion Quest Complete ---
Zagreus: It's done, Mother! Father. The invitations. Personally sent to everyone with whom I've been in contact. So, what do we do now?
Persephone: Excellent, Zagreus! Congratulate him, Hades! On a job well done.
Hades: *Grr. *Persephone, how can you be so certain your request was executed to your satisfaction?
Persephone: It's known as trust, Hades. Or faith? They're similar. Try one, sometime! It'll be good for you. As for what we do next... why, we've a great, big feast we must prepare!
Hades: This House is not a suitable location for such guests! Dionysus, alone, shall bring ruin to this place! Or... *urgh*... the faith thing that you said.
Persephone: Yes, good! Now then... we have a lot of work to go around, so why don't we call everyone on staff, and let them in on this, and dole out suitable responsibilities, all right?
Hades: All right....
Zagreus: All right.
Persephone: All right!
Persephone: ...*Whew*! I'd say that went about as well as could have been expected! And the cleanup wasn't all that bad. For the most part.
Zagreus: We're fortunate Uncle Zeus seemed to catch on right away, and went along with it. But, this whole elaborate tale you spun... I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
Persephone: Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.
Zagreus: You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.
Persephone: The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.
Zagreus: You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?
Persephone: Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive.
Zagreus: And Uncle Zeus is glad things didn't turn out worse for *him*. I get the sense he acts a bit impulsively at times, and deals with the consequences later.
Persephone: What can I tell you, Zagreus? We're family. You said it yourself to me before: We're stuck with one another. That any of us like each other in the slightest... it's a wonder and a blessing, I think.
Zagreus: Yeah. I know what you mean. Thanks, Mother. Think I'll be heading out again soon. See you when I get back?


--- Persephone With Hades 01 ---
Persephone: ...*Oh*, come on, Hades! Mortals are much more resilient than that! What, you think they'll show up at your gates here, all at once? They have our family looking out for them.
Hades: That is what I'm afraid of. Do you truly believe my brothers and the rest shall take the sort of care of them while they draw breath, as we do here after they have expired?
Persephone: It's true we have to look out for them indefinitely, while Olympus need only look out for them for a little while. But our relatives are always watching from their mountain! And if they do turn a blind eye once in a while... mortals aren't bad at fending for themselves.
Hades: But they are never satisfied! Always begging us to provide more, and more.
Persephone: They *like *us, Hades! They praise us, tell one another about us. What do you expect? Would you rather they forgot about us?
Hades: ...No. No, I suppose not. But they *need *us!


--- Persephone With Hades 02 ---
Hades: ...And what of the complaints from Elysium? They wanted the lawns thoroughly manicured for their athletic contests.
Persephone: Already taken care of. Though, the flooding in Asphodel, *hm*, that doesn't look like something we can clear up for quite some time. Fortunately, the residents seem to be getting accustomed to it.
Hades: There have been fewer reports about it as of late. And what of the Satyr problem? Blasted things are rampant up there, still.
Persephone: Well, they're probably contained up there, at least. And Zagreus has been keeping them in check, hasn't he?


--- Persephone With Hades 03 ---
Hades: ...Well, be that as it may... if they pester you at all, do let me know, and I shall have them dealt with quickly.
Persephone: *Oh*, Hades... I think the shades around here have been through enough as it is! I don't mind them. After all the time I spent on my own, having some company has been a welcome change.
Hades: You are certain all your needs have been provided for? Because if there is anything that you require...
Persephone: *Require*? Look at this place, Hades. Look at *me*! I have everything! And so do you. Try not to worry quite so much. And be patient with your son. That's all I ask.
Hades: Persephone, I cannot promise you such things, they're... not my strengths. Besides, I have a reputation to uphold! *God of the dead*! If the wretches do not fear me, or *you *for that matter... what, then?
Persephone: I'm not going to tell you how to balance your work, your marriage, and your parental responsibilities. I don't think anybody on Olympus or below knows quite how best to manage that. So long as we do our best.


--- Persephone With Hades 04 ---
Hades: ...Sometimes, I... still cannot believe that you are here. Returned to us. Your radiance, in all this darkness... you must miss seeing the coast.
Persephone: The coast was nice enough, Hades. But nothing is ever perfect, right? No matter how hard you try. Still... I think we get quite close around here, every once in a while.
Hades: You have taken much less time adjusting to this place than when first you joined us. Part of my surprise. I, myself, was forced to be here. I never thought anyone would come from the surface here by choice.
Persephone: The heart can make us do the strangest things, can't it?
