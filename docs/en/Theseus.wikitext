|"''Ah, hahaha'', it's finally time, Asterius. He's here! Aren't you, now, you vile, insignificant hellspawn? Prepare now to be overrun!!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, this is unfair... that's a bronze-plated Macedonian Tau-Lambda! What's an obnoxious bellyacher like you doing with the most durable chariot created, to date?"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Pah''! You don't deserve to know. Suffice it that Asterius and I were handsomely rewarded once again. And we shall not hesitate to exploit our hard-fought spoils against ''you''!"
|-

|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"He would pit you against me, Asterius. I can see it in his mis-matched eyes! I cannot shake the terrible vision that, someday or night, it shall be me, standing alone here, whilst you...? Whilst you take sides against me! With that ''fiend''!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Asterius, about that, please consider it a standing offer, if you like. I'd rather have you as a friend than as a foe. Not sure that I can say the same for Theseus, of course."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''You poisonous worm''! I knew you had a more sinister trick at play, because your fighting style certainly is of no concern just on its own! Are there truly no depths to which you would not stoop?!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 03 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"...I'm telling you, you're ''wrong'', Asterius! He is no ''royalty'', most certainly not any ''I ''would recognize! He's but a nameless, long-forgotten minor god born of the depths, and bound to stay in them!"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I, too, once was berated by such words, king. We've faced this enemy how many times? And in my estimation, he's fought bravely, here."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Bravely''?! Hiding behind those pillars is what you call ''bravely'', Asterius? We shall have to discuss this strange lapse of judgment after we achieve our victory!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 04 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"I hope you're perfectly pleased with yourself, hellspawn. Because Asterius has been quite cross with me! Such as he is. He says I have misjudged the likes of you! ''Outrageousness''."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"You don't hear me, king. We still have a lot to learn about this foe. Each time, he's differently equipped. Weapons, god-given abilities, and such. Despite our efforts... it's been difficult to read his strategies."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"And now, you're saying I can't fight, Asterius? Even though I had no difficulty besting ''you ''within that maze of yours?! Come on, let's do this fight!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 05 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Well, worm! Come fight us, I suppose. And take fullest advantage of the havoc that you sowed! We are no team! We're merely two combatants, simultaneously booked to be here, now."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"King, I think you are over-reacting, here. Try to be reasonable. And be more considerate about my point of view. Don't think I am asking for too much."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"You're asking the impossible of me! But, let us fight. And let us lose, I'm sure, because if we are not a team, what are we, then, Asterius...?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 06 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Please fight with me, again, Asterius. I mean, just like before! You must forgive me my indecencies of late. This blasted fiend! His lies and treachery get right under my skin. Or the phantasmagorical equivalent!"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Swear something to me, king. That you'll discard your fears about our bond. The short one here is never going to break it. He doesn't even understand it. The only one who can break it is you, yourself."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"I... oh, my dear friend, Asterius. I see, of course, you're right, you're right. ''You're right''! And I solemnly do swear to you, indeed, that I shall never again doubt our brotherhood! Nor shall I ever listen to this fiend! Together, now and always!!"
|-

|'''Theseus'''
|"Come forth, blackguard, and you shall soon be crushed under the massive wheels of the finest chariot the world has ever known!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You only have that chariot because of me, you know. It's all because of a condition of the Pact of Punishment! Nothing you did or earned. So drop the act!"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Hahahahah'', what?! You claim to be my benefactor, when in truth, you are my figuratively mortal enemy?! I'll do the chariot-equivalent of trample you!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Extreme Measures 03
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Come, blackguard! And be crushed beneath the raging wheelwork of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda, once again!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Theseus, you do know you look even more ridiculous than normal wearing that mask? I get the chariot and the unsporting weaponry, but why wear ''that ''thing?"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Bah! ''This blessed mask was crafted by great Daedalus, himself! A work of art, and my entitled claim as champion! What has he ever done for you?!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Pact Reverted 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Well now, Asterius, he's returned! And this time, we shall have to vanquish him without the aid of our divine armor! A worthy challenge, no?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Be cautious not to underestimate him, king. He has proved troublesome before."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Nonsense, my friend! For how can one underestimate that which deserves no esteem whatsoever?! Together, now, ''attack''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Well, you senseless monster, I suspect you're not so pleased with yourself, now! Behold!! For my glorious chariot has been restored!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, indeed, nice work! Though must have cost a fortune in gemstones and diamonds, restoring an old Macedonian. I thought it was totaled after last time."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"The only thing which shall be totaled here, you heartless property-destroying scourge, is ''you yourself''! Asterius!! Together, let us break him!"
|-

|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"My chariot and I stand ready for you, daemon! And I assume Asterius, as well! I feel it in my phantom heart, we shall not fall to you this time!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You know, my opinion of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda has fallen precipitously of late. Though perhaps it's not the chariot but the driver."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Silence''!! Show me a finer chariot-driver anywhere within Elysium, why, you cannot! I'll run you down for such an insult to my pride!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 03
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Ready yourself and your fine armor, friend Asterius! I shall drive circles around him, whilst you dispatch him with your mighty axe!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Your strategy might work a little better if you didn't shout it loud enough for me to hear. Though I have to say I'm impressed you can drive, fight, and shout all at the same time."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"And ''I'', fiend, am impressed that ''you ''yet live and breathe! A temporary state Asterius and I shall soon alleviate! ''To war''!!"
|-

|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Poseidon Quest Reaction 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Avert your eyes, fiend, lest the shining bronzework of the Macedonian should strike you blind! We are prepared to face your devilry!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Prepared for me, really? I've dismantled your ridiculous chariot before. Even Poseidon knows you're just a blowhard with a fancy ride."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"How ''dare ''you to invoke my Lord Poseidon's name?! And, to besmirch our complicated past! No god shall ever favor you as he has favored both Asterius and me!"
|-

|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Theseus?! The Bull of Minos?! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!"
|-

|"''Ahh'', a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"I warned you, short one. Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only other foe whom I have ever faced, who bested me."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here."

|-

|"You know full well that wasn't a fair fight. Face me yourself and we'll see how you fare."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Silence'', you monster! I'll hear no more such wicked lies, half-truths, or quarter-truths! You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!"
|-

|"Besmirch ''what ''honor? You're just complaining that you lost. Even though I was outnumbered!"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Silence'', you monster!! I'll hear no more such wicked lies, half-truths, or quarter-truths! You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!"

! colspan="2" |Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"What are those bestial gloves of yours, blackguard? Beginning to show more of your true and savage nature, here perhaps?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"No. He bears the Twin Fists in the aspect of a king called Gilgamesh. That king, he, too, wrestled a beastlike man, who then became a friend. Maybe that's why I knew this fight would come."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"What are you telling me, Asterius? Now is certainly not a good time for waxing philosophical, I think! And, surely this King Gilgamesh of whom you speak is much more competent a fighter than ''this ''filth!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Encounter 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"So, hellspawn! You seek to break through to the surface of the world. But you shall not achieve your goal, whilst I yet live and breathe! Or the equivalent of it, here in the splendors of Elysium!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Then you leave me with little choice but to make you shut up, already. And your bull-headed manservant there."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"That ''Minotaur ''whom you address is my dear friend, you preconceiving stain upon the earth! Asterius and I are brothers here in death as we were enemies in life. Not that you could ever understand fraternal bonds as strong as ours!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Encounter 02
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Ah-hah'', the fiend comes crawling back once more, drawn as he is much like the unassuming moth unto the flame of righteousness!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh no! Not the flame of righteousness! Are you finished? Let's get this started, I've come a long way."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Hear that, Asterius? Our fiendish visitor is begging us for mercy. Begging us, no doubt, to drop our guard!! Together now, my friend, let's vanquish him, and may the glory of Olympus guide us!!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Encounter 03
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"And where do you think you're going, fiend?! Thought you might scoot right past Asterius and myself without a fight?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"No, on quite the contrary I've been under no impression that avoiding conflict is an option here. So say your piece, and let's get on with it."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"You, hellspawn, shall not traverse that gate behind me whilst my compatriot and I equivalently live and breathe! Prepare for death!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Encounter 04
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Ah, hahaha, ''you are just in time, Fiend from Lowest Depths! Asterius and I have trained extensively since our last skirmish here!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So all you do here in Elysium is train for martial competition? You're constantly awaiting your next fight to the death?"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"And who are ''you ''to judge, you misbegotten, shameful, unfilial maggot? It is an ''honor ''to have the opportunity to spend my afterlife perpetually standing in your ruinous path!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Encounter 05
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"See here, Asterius! The god-hated fiend is back once more to be destroyed by our joint, righteous fury!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''God-hated''? You'll have to be more specific. I have the gods on my side. Though I suppose you do, too. Why can't they make up their minds?"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"They ''have ''made up their minds! They stand united against darkness, as do I! With the exception of Asterius, here, who serves the light! Let's serve it now, my friend! To battle!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Win Streak 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Upon my word, the fiend again darkens these halls! Alas, Asterius, it seems I was mistaken and he hasn't learned his lesson after all!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And what's this lesson that I ought have learned? Is it to always slay you first since you're so damn insufferable all the time?"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Your lesson, monster, is to never, ''ever ''take up arms against those favored by the gods themselves! You shall never see the light of day as I once did! Uh, no offense, Asterius."
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Lose Streak 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Well, hellspawn, you stained my honor last we battled here. But as you plainly see, I have returned! As has Asterius! And we've no shortage of honor left to spare!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Shouldn't ''I '' be the Champion of Elysium, now that I've beaten you? Isn't there someone else around to challenge me, say, Heracles? Someone less chatty?"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Ah, hahaha, ''very clever, fiend. Invoking Heracles' name, in an attempt to drive me to a jealous rage. It shall not work! But you shall dearly pay nevertheless!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Lose Streak 02 A
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"The monster has returned, in a vainglorious attempt to wrest the title Champion from me!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I couldn't care less about your title. Though, shouldn't you share it with the Minotaur? He's more than half the reason you've been any trouble."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"You'll not drive a wedge between us, fiend. Asterius and I share a fraternal bond forged from the strongest bronze! Nay, adamant! But you have caused us both offense, so, die!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Lose Streak 02
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"I have recovered, as you can plainly see, monster! As has Asterius! And this time we are filled with renewed vigor, to destroy you utterly!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So we're locked in an endless cycle of violence, basically. I guess that's one way for you to pass the time here in this stodgy place."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"You take that back about Elysium! Or, better: I shall make you eat those careless, inappropriate remarks! Come, Asterius, ''to war''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus With Asterius 02
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"We're well-equipped to deal with you, short one. Though I know better than to disregard your might."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Speak for yourself, Asterius! I, for one, know only pure contempt for this foul daemon and his underhanded fighting style! A style we shall easily dismantle, now!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus With Asterius 03
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"What hope have you, monster, versus the blessed bonds of brotherhood?"
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"Best not belittle him, king. He is more powerful than he appears. We must remain alert, this time."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Oh, I am perfectly alert right now, Asterius! And were I still alive, I would be positively salivating at the thought of running through this pustule with my spear, or whichever means I had available! Now, ''let's go''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus With Asterius 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Theseus, before you flap your ghostly gums at me again, I'd like to hear from good Asterius this time! He almost never gets a word in, thanks to you."
|-
|'''Minotaur'''
|"The king speaks for the both of us, short one. Though if you wish to hear me say something to you, I will oblige."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"And I, too, shall oblige! That is, oblige my trusty spear, which yearns to penetrate your soft and vulnerable, altogether pallid flesh! Now, die!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Post Ending 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Why, look, Asterius, the fiend returns! The rumors that he fled to haunt the surface must have been mere lies!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well no, in this case, those rumors must have been quite accurate, it's just, I'm back! Realized I didn't want a future for myself that didn't include crushing you repeatedly like this."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Oh, ''hoho'', such ''clever ''excuse-making from one so versed in treachery! Well, if you are indeed contained within this realm, then we shall be delighted to make sure it always stays that way! Now come and fight!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Have you yet heard, monster?! The Queen Persephone is back! To rule the Underworld in all her terrifying grace! Perhaps one of these days or nights she shall be present in the stands, to witness your destruction at our hands!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah, about that? She's my mother. So maybe watch your fool mouth with me, or else I might just put in a bad word!"
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Oh, you disgust me, daemon, that you would even dare to say such things about the Queen! Prepare now to be ''vanquished ''in her name!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Low Health 01

|"What's this, Asterius? This blackguard thinks that he can saunter in here whilst bleeding profusely, and confront the two of us?! A hollow fool!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Ran into trouble on the way with your combative friends here in Elysium. One more unfair advantage in your favor."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"How would you know of fairness, fiend? You belong in the lowest depths, forgotten in the mists of time! Come, let us send you there!"
|-

|"Look at this contemptible fiend, stumbling half-dead already into our hallowed colosseum! What transpired, monster, did perchance my Exalted brethren trouble your dark path?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Theseus? I would appreciate it if you could be more considerate of the substantial effort necessary just to reach this point where I can make you shut your mouth."
|-

|"Effort, ''pah''! You shall be imminently slain, and ''effortlessly'', I am quite certain of that! Asterius, to arms!!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Theseus Low Health 03

|"What hope can you possibly have of vanquishing us, hellspawn, when you are visibly upon the verge of death? You are, more than usual, a miserable sight!"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thanks for your concern, there, Theseus. But I trust I have plenty of life left in me with which to destroy you, if not your companion as well."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, this? I just picked it out of a Well. Was supposed to help me get here. No offense intended, more than usual. What's it to you?"
|-

|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"Maybe ''you ''should ''shut up''!! That Ariadne's dead to me. She has been since we were alive! I cherish her memory, yes. But only because, if not for her, I'd not have met Asterius! Now, meet his axe!!"

|"You ''do ''know I'm related to them, right? The god of the dead is my father? I'm sure word's gotten around. Not that I want deferential treatment from the likes of you."

|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"So, I am honored even in the lowest pits of hell? And yet, remembered in my carefree youth. Not in the wisdom of my latter days! Well then, remember ''this''!"

|'''Theseus'''
|"How ''dare ''you say such things to me! I was the greatest king of Athens in my day! The tales of my exploits with Asterius and many other challenges shall long outlive whatever comes of ''you''!"

|"Oh, this? I wouldn't say I stole it, so much as naturally wooed the Fates into bestowing it upon me. You could say I'm kind of testing it out."
|-
|'''Theseus'''
|"''Ahh'', well then! I pity whosoever shall lay hands upon that cursed thing, once you are finished with this ''testing ''of yours. I think that we can make it rather quick!"
