! colspan="2" |Zeus With Artemis 01
|-
|'''Zeus'''
|"Now, Zagreus, once you arrive, we'll have to find for you a suitable mate, won't we? Fine young man such as yourself! Normally, there's much to choose from around here, with some exceptions, of course... such as my cunning daughter, Artemis. Willfully uninclined to take a mate, at all!"
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Yes, Zagreus, in spite of all these perfect, chiseled prospects everywhere about, yearning to marry or embarrass me, for some reason, I prefer to spend my time mostly alone or with my nymph friends in the woods!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Zeus 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"''Tsk'', ''um'', Zagreus... rather than greet you as I normally would do, instead, allow me to present you my illustrious, kind, generous lord father, your greatest Uncle Zeus!"
|-
|'''Zeus'''
|"''Erm'', thank you for the introduction, Daughter! Now, you run along, go frolic with your nymphs, or something! Leave me to assist my nephew, here. Bestow on him your faint blessing, if you must."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Poseidon 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You know my father and my uncle, by now, right, Zagreus? I don't know which of them is worse. ''Uh'', I mean... superior! Superior, despite technically spending most of his time in the seas, beneath Olympus, isn't that right, Uncle?"
|-
|'''Poseidon'''
|"Oh, Artemis, you needn't boast to little Hades there on my account! Besides! Whether you're in the sea, above it, or beneath, makes little difference to your measure as a god! You two are young as yet! Keep at it, and you'll soon be practically as great as I!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Aphrodite 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, ''uh'', Zagreus! There's something I've been wondering, and don't take this the wrong way or anything, OK? Oh, no. It's her."
|-
|'''Aphrodite'''
|"Why, Artemis, you're absolutely tongue-tied! Due to our little godling in the Underworld, or a little due to me? ''Hm-hm'', you shall figure it all out I'm sure!"
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Look, what was I, ''ugh'', just, never mind. I'll talk to you some other time, I guess."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Aphrodite 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"''Erm'', Zagreus, despite my hunter's instincts here, it seems I was unable to elude Aphrodite in this particular case, who insisted that we present ourselves to you at the same time, for whatever reason..."
|-
|'''Aphrodite'''
|"Oh, come now, Artemis! I'm sure you're very capable of hiding from a common beast, but I can see you plain. Why not be honest with yourself, next time?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Ares 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Zagreus, I wish we all could hear you so that good Lord Ares here might be persuaded that my powers are entirely for different purposes than his!"
|-
|'''Ares'''
|"Perhaps our skillsets once were meant for different purposes, dear Artemis; but who are we to doubt the end result? Observe what shall transpire once we grant our kin our combined might."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Ares 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Zagreus, I was just hoping for a little privacy before this hunt, which is consistently my preference here, except, you see, Lord Ares always seems to come sniffing about, first sign of any hunting instruments!"
|-
|'''Ares'''
|"Why, my dear Artemis, the hunt is but a prelude to a war, is that not so? For if all mortalkind knew naught of hunting, why, they would not be nearly so adept at killing one another."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Look, Lord Ares, if I lend you better marksmanship ability, you think that you could bother someone else?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Dionysus 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Oh, great, it's you, Zagreus! Here, let me offer you some fine new Boons, as well as Lord Dionysus here, who I am sure would love to talk your ear off just as much as mine!"
|-
|'''Dionysus'''
|"''Eh'', tells me I'm being awful loud, and to back off, all sorts of nasty stuff like that, what can you do, though, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis With Demeter 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Oh, hi there, Zagreus, I was just failing to persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up off the snowy stretch that we've been having for a while. Some of the mortals are quite weary of it now, and it sure doesn't make the hunting any easier!"
|-
|'''Demeter'''
|"The mortals are resourceful, Artemis. Their one redeeming quality, perhaps! They'll find a way through our long winter here. They ought to, since they brought it on themselves."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Rama Aspect 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Um, Zagreus, did you attempt to chat with Coronacht just yet? Remember, tell the bow ''I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! ''Something good's supposed to happen if you do, some divine archer-person's aspect I should think? You going to try it soon, or not?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Rama Aspect 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, look at that! The message must have worked! Practically can see that shiny bow from here! I've never wielded Coronacht myself, at least not yet. Though if the Fates are sending visions to me of its past or future bearers, why, I guess I'm bound to get my shot eventually!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Olympian Reunion Quest 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Found you, Huntress, here. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Especially for you, Lady Artemis!"
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Some kind of special message for me...! Oh, looks like there's one for everybody on Olympus, then. Felt rather special for a moment, there! And now you're making me check in with all the others. Great!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Have to say, I had a pretty decent time with everybody at our little visit recently! Met you, Uncle Hades, even great Achilles! Still don't quite appreciate you tricking us, but ''eh''! I can get over it eventually. Anyway, you still could use assistance from me, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Zeus 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Ah, good old Father Zeus, he must have blessed you with his lightning bolts, did he? Always looking out for everyone."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Poseidon 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Uncle Poseidon blessed you, didn't he. To think that big, fat oaf is your own father's brother. I'm told to be respectful near him, but it's hard."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Athena 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You met Athena earlier, I guess? I'd never trade my bow for all that pomp and armor, but... I guess to each her own."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Ares 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You're pretty close with Ares, aren't you? And here they said it couldn't be done. If I were you I'd watch myself with him."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Aphrodite 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"So Aphrodite reached you first, did she? Sounds exactly like something she'd do. She has a knack for trouble. So, let's just stay focused, here!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Dionysus 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"That lush and lecher, Dionysus, counts you as a friend? I'm hoping that there must be some mistake, yeah, Zagreus?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Hermes 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You seem particularly light on your feet, there, Zagreus. I'd figure Hermes, himself, was speeding you along, except I've not seen him about in... been a while, really."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Demeter 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"So even Demeter's become involved in this! Didn't think she would. Though you'll be glad she did! Provided you stay on her warm and fuzzy side, of course. Working on that, myself!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Backstory 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Something's troubled me a little, about you. You fight so desperately. At first I thought you simply lacked in patience. But now I see it's urgency that drives you. What is it that you're after, really...?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Run Progress 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Let's see. You blundered headlong into danger for the past six chambers or more. And you made such a racket I could almost hear it from Olympus. I have to say, your hunting skills are rather unconventional."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Run Progress 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I'm with you every step till you arrive here, Zagreus. Then I will probably ignore you like the rest. Just warning you ahead of time, all right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Vermin 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Say, were you hunting vermin near the surface lately, Zagreus? That's practically just like the real thing! It must have been a thrill!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Vermin 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You've become a right accomplished vermin hunter, Zagreus! Maybe you'll get to use those skills against worthier creatures soon enough."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Vs Meg 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"That Fury down in Tartarus has been a real problem, hasn't she. I see the huntress instinct in her. She thinks she knows your weaknesses. Don't let yourself become predictable."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Vs Achilles 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, I once heard Lord Hades has in his employ the greatest hero of the Trojan War, you happen to know anything about that? I'm kind of a fan. You see Achilles, tell him he's the best for me!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Vs Achilles 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"So, I have heard that Achilles, himself, taught you how to fight! No wonder you can hold your own down there, that is amazing...! You be sure to honor him from time to time, got it?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Post Flashback 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Living on Olympus here, I'm surrounded by my family, but I always felt alone. I know that's not the same as your experience, but, I'm just saying I relate to what you're going through."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis High Affinity 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I think you might enjoy it on Olympus, there's... a lot of feasting here, I guess, and the air is cool and crisp, and it's much brighter than it is down there. Sounds like a dream, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis High Affinity 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I hope that once you make it to Olympus we'll go hunting sometime, you and I, you know? I like being on my own and all, but it's been nice, talking to you like this."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis High Affinity 03
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I grow so tired of the others here, you know? Much rather be out with the woodland nymphs than with these gods upon this mountaintop. You must know what it's like."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Callisto 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Not everybody on Olympus is a total disappointment, Zagreus. Why, someday maybe you could meet Callisto, she goes hunting with me all the time! Bet you don't see many woodland nymphs down there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Callisto 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey Zagreus, that Nectar you sent? Callisto and the nymphs and I, we popped it open recently, and it was really good! Had us positively frolicking about. So, thanks!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Callisto 03
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You must have a friend or two, don't you? It's hard being alone all of the time. At least I have Callisto and the other nymphs, and... I have you! A distant friend is still a friend, isn't that right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Callisto 04
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hope you don't mind, I told Callisto all about you recently! Don't worry, I was quite discreet about it, the two of us were on the hunt, not like I just shouted out your story from the mountaintops!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Callisto 05
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Zagreus, if only you could turn yourself into a woodland creature and just fly or burrow out of there! My Callisto, she can turn into a bear, you ever seen those? Monstrous, furry things, quite huggable, if they don't kill you first!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Callisto 06
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You've never even seen the woods, have you? I hope you do, someday. You could meet Callisto and the others! It's quite beautiful, and green, and calm, it's... anyway."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Callisto 07
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Don't know what it is about you, Zagreus, but I feel like I can be me with you, you know? Maybe it's that you don't constantly talk over me like everybody else, besides Callisto and the nymphs I guess. Not that I can even hear you, but, you know what I mean, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Has Weapon 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, how'd you get your hands on a nice bow like that? You take good care of Coronacht for me, so I can try it too once you're up here."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Bow Weapon Progress 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Have to admit, you're very capable with Coronacht. Now I can hit a bull's eye in my sleep, but you'll be right there with me if I don't keep practicing I think!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Spear Weapon 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, that's the Eternal Spear, Varatha, isn't it? Your father used to use that, didn't he. A bit ornate for hunting, but a spear's a spear, is what I like to say!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Achilles Aspect 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, that can't possibly be the spear once wielded by the great Achilles, there, can it?! The shape is unmistakable, I mean, have you even the slightest just how many mortals got completely slaughtered by that thing? Oh, it has seen some use!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Chiron Aspect 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"That's not the Coronacht I know, isn't that... Chiron the centaur's bow? So that was Coronacht, as well? Seems every decent bow was just a version of that thing! Except for mine, of course."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Hera Aspect 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Say, that's the bow Stepmother Hera herself once wielded, isn't it? Her aspect of Coronacht! I'd know it from the... frankly rather sinister skulls all over it. It's very Hera, trust me."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Fist Weapon 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"When did you get your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists? Hands ''in'', I ought to say! I heard that one time, Demeter, she smacked her father right square in the face with those! Bet you can probably relate."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Gun Weapon 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Well, look at you, with Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! Seems much too noisy-complicated as a hunting weapon when you could just use a nice quiet bow, but hey, to each her own."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Reveals Rama Aspect 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Now listen, Zagreus, admittedly this is a little strange, even from me. I have a message for your bow! That's right, just go on up to Coronacht next time, and tell it with a firm, commanding voice, ''I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! ''Let me know how it goes, OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Keepsake 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, that's my Adamant Arrowhead on you! Normally, it's for killing things, but in your case it makes it even easier for me to hunt you down, even in the dark. Now that I found you... here!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis About Zagreus 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Your name, it means '''great hunter''', Zagreus! I guess your mother Nyx must have expected someday that you'd pick up a few pointers from myself!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Run Cleared 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, hold a moment, Zagreus, I could have sworn... you were so close, before, but now you're back? Ah, must have tripped up just when victory was close at hand, it happens all the time. We'll get you out of there, you'll see!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Low Health 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, you all right there, Zagreus? Wouldn't do to have you die on me just moments after meeting here like this."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Low Health 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"''Oh''! Look at you, you're hurt there pretty bad, but, just stay focused on the hunt, and it'll help to keep the pain at bay."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Low Health 03
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Look, I'm just goddess of the hunt, not medicine, so... I don't know if this is going to help right now, but, here!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Low Health 04
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Your hunt has evidently not been going very well so far, I see. Though, maybe we can still turn it around."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Low Health 05
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Well, one good thing about all of the blood you've lost is it was even easier to track you down this time!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Legendary Pick Up 01
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"All right, get ready for this, Zagreus, because I seldom share the greatest of my hunting secrets like I am about to."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Legendary Pick Up 02
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"All right, no need to keep on toying with your prey. Here comes one of my finest blessings, ''now''!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Legendary Pick Up 03
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I don't reveal my greatest hunting techniques for just anybody, Zagreus, so you better appreciate what you're about to get, and use it to go far!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Legendary Pick Up 04
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"How about we not take any chances this time, Zagreus? So here, this is the best I've got. You better not waste it!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis First Pick Up
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"There's only one heavenly archer I know of. Well, several, really. Anyway! In the name of Hades! Olympus? I accept this message."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I heard about you. Look, I'm not like all the others on Olympus. The power of the hunt helps keep me company, so... maybe it'll help you, too!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 01

|"Hey. You're not alone. You're not alone down there, OK? Here, let me show you."
|-

|"The dead must make a rather easy target, wouldn't you say? Let's see what you can do to them, given your choice of these."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 04
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You busy, Zagreus? Thought maybe I could interest you in some of these old hunting tricks of mine."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 05
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"How fares the hunt this time around, OK? I bet it could be better, so, ''erm'', here! Maybe this'll help."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 06
|-

|"Let's take a little hunting expedition, yeah? You'll do most of the work, but hey, I'll be with you in spirit!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 07
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Sorry you're still stuck down there. Sometimes I feel stuck myself, but, a good hunt always sets me straight."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 08
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"When I am on the hunt, my mind is clear, and nothing stands between me and my target. Though, have a blessing just in case you can't relate!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 09
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I'd love to know about your life down there. I'll try and help you live through it this time so that way you can tell me?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 10
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"The wretches whom you face down there have died already, sometimes more than once. Should make for easy targets, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 11
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I've never come across a target I couldn't take down. I expect the same of you, you hear me? Hopefully you hear me."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 12
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Good hunting, Zagreus! The sooner you get out of there the sooner you can save me from my insufferable relatives. Please?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 13
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey, Zagreus, good luck out there, this time. I'd tell you '''may your aim be true' ''but I can guarantee it, actually."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 14
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"The hunt requires utter concentration, so, I'll leave you to it, and... just watch your every move in silence over here..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 15
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You want to make it out of there, you... don't have to listen to a word I say, to be quite honest, but... my huntress blessings ought to help."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 16
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Well, Zagreus, you getting out of there this time, or am I going to have to keep on hunting by myself for the time being? Probably?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 17
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Looks to me like you could use a little help, so I'll just have a look in my big bag of blessings here, and, ''oh''! Here's just the thing."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 18
|-

|"The hunt comes down to kill-or-be-killed. Except for us immortals, who have to live with our shame, which is worse?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 19
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Those wretched things harassing you throughout that Underworld just won't give up, will they? Well, just keep killing them, I guess!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Misc Pickup 20
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Need a hunting partner, Zagreus? Not that I'm able to join you myself down there, or even hear you respond for that matter, but, anyway, here."

|-

|-

|-

|"You hunted down a real bargain there in Charon's shop, though how about we try a slightly bigger deal on for size right now?"

|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Rejection 03

|"''Huh'', so that's your choice! Maybe you're more like my relatives than I'd care to admit."
|-

|-

|-

|-

|"Lady Artemis, I hope that you'll accept this offering, for all your kindness and support."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Hey thank you for this, really. And, I've just the thing to offer in return. It's just a gift, OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Gift 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"My lady Artemis! This is nothing, next to all your grace and favor."
|-

|"Hey wait, this is an offering, for me? I, ''oh'', that's very kind, though, let's get back to hunting, now, OK?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Gift 03
|-
|'''Zagreus'''

|-

|"Look, Zagreus, I don't know what to say, except for... thanks!"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Gift 04
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"My lady Artemis, your favor's been invaluable to me. No finer huntress ever walked the surface of the earth, or underneath."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"You're being very nice to me, and that makes me suspicious, understand? So, you want more of that... you keep this up."
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Gift 05
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"At the risk of incurring your wrath, Lady Artemis, I hope you will accept this from me, and see that my gratitude for all you have done for me is genuine."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"What do you know, another gift of Nectar, that's... quite thoughtful of you, Zagreus! Normally don't care much for the stuff, but, every now and then, I mean... why not?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Gift 06
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"In your honor, Lady Artemis! Your mighty blessings have helped me through so many trials now, and I always welcome your level-headed presence here."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Look, I like being worshiped just as much as anybody, Zagreus, though bear in mind that you can always leave the worship of me to the forest nymphs, all right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Artemis Gift 07
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I know you have no shortage of Ambrosia on Olympus, Lady Artemis, but I imagine it's less often that the stuff go all the way from there to here, and back. What can I say? You make me proud to be a member of this family."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"I never felt like I could be myself with everybody on this mountaintop, you know? So much posturing, and bickering, and... I just head out to the woods most of the time. Maybe you understand me better than the rest, I've no idea still. But I appreciate you've made attempts to try."
|-

|"Oh dearest! I have brought you keen-eyed Artemis, who, in her focus on the hunt, has not developed social graces suitable enough to come to you herself!"
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Social graces, she says! Going about like ''that''! I'm sure you know that I can find you when it's necessary, Zagreus. Though, how to get away from Aphrodite, I have no idea."

|"Zag, man, I was just attempting here to get our good friend Artemis to finally make an appearance at one of my feasts, it's just... wouldn't you know, she's all preoccupied, something about a hunt?"
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"That's right, Lord Dionysus, a ''hunt''! Which requires lots and lots of ''total quiet'', and clear-minded focus. So, if you'll excuse me?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Athena With Artemis 01
|-
|'''Athena'''
|"If you've a moment, Zagreus? One of my relatives has claimed that I usurp your time. So I invited her to contact you."
|-

|"Um, hello, Zagreus... Athena here is grandstanding or trying to prove a point, or something. I don't know. Anyway, nice talking to you."
|-
|'''Athena'''
|"Well, I suppose that's settled, then. I am afraid such interactions aren't uncommon here amongst my family; but what's a family without flaws?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Poseidon With Artemis 01
|-
|'''Poseidon'''
|"The thing about me, Nephew, is I get along with everybody, here! A skill apparently that's rather rare! Take my niece Artemis, for instance! Can't ever take a simple jest, at all! You won't easily attract a mate with such a sour look about you, girl!"
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Oh, and wouldn't that be such a pity, Uncle Poseidon. I wonder what could be the cause of this sour look that I perpetually have up here? Maybe Zagreus knows."
|-
|'''Poseidon'''
|"''Hahaha''! See exactly what I mean, Nephew?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Demeter With Artemis
|-
|'''Demeter'''
|"Why, Zagreus, my gentle Artemis here was just saying how concerned she was for your predicament! I'm sure she'd like it if we both could help you in this case."
|-
|'''Artemis'''
|"Concerned? I don't see anyone concerned, you have this, Zagreus! You don't need anybody's help, and you can get through this all on your own, though just in case, and I mean just in case! Um, here."
