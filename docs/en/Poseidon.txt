--- Ares With Poseidon 01 ---
Ares: Well, my hellborn kin, I have to say that there are times I wish I could have been acquainted with your father somewhat more, if you'll forgive my saying so. My father and my uncle, here... they're predisposed quite differently than I.
Poseidon: Perhaps if you were not so odd, and made more effort to be somewhat more approachable, Ares, then we'd have more in common, you and I! Should you need any tips on that, why, you just let me know!


--- Artemis With Poseidon 01 ---
Artemis: You know my father and my uncle, by now, right, Zagreus? I don't know which of them is worse. *Uh*, I mean... superior! Superior, despite technically spending most of his time in the seas, beneath Olympus, isn't that right, Uncle?
Poseidon: Oh, Artemis, you needn't boast to little Hades there on my account! Besides! Whether you're in the sea, above it, or beneath, makes little difference to your measure as a god! You two are young as yet! Keep at it, and you'll soon be practically as great as I!


--- Aphrodite With Poseidon 01 ---
Aphrodite: The thing to know about this family, dearest, is that, each of us, we have our little quirks. Although, we always stick together and our love for one another perseveres!
Poseidon: Oh, *hoh*! What do we have here, little Hades? Seems to me that you have *company*! Well, I'll just leave the two of you alone. My lips are sealed tighter than a warship hull!
Aphrodite: Oh, feel free to stay, Poseidon! I was just explaining what an idiot you are, though you're able to articulate this best! Anyway, dearest, what was I on about...?


--- Dionysus With Poseidon 01 ---
Dionysus: *Uh*, Zag, *erm*... your uncle's passing through. Not Dad, *erm*, the other one I mean, and he just wanted to check in, see how you're doing, so...
Poseidon: *Ah-hah*, there you are, my little nephew! Dionysus showing you the ropes, or what? You want a real feast, though, you just stick with *me*! Now take my blessing, *go*!
Dionysus: *Oh*, anyway we're here, man, waiting up for you! We know you're going to make it, I would say eventually?


--- Athena With Poseidon 01 ---
Athena: When I first notified Lord Father Zeus and other members of our family of your existence, Zagreus, it was Uncle Poseidon here who first leapt up, and pledged his power over sea and earth to you. Is that not so, Uncle?
Poseidon: Exactly so, Athena! You, with that fine memory of yours! For it isn't everyday I learn my doleful brother Hades sired a fine son! He does not know how good he has it, there! And *you*, Nephew, could have it even better, *here*!


--- Poseidon With Zeus 01 ---
Poseidon: Now, little Hades, you have met my brother Zeus! He's sometimes known as king of all the gods! Although, in many ways, he's not as powerful as I! Nor anywhere as dashing. Why, I, *oop*--!
Zeus: Now, Brother... you know better than to say such things about me, I should think. I know that tact does not come easily to you, though I'd be careful what you say to our good nephew, there.
Poseidon: *Buh*, *erm*, anyway, as I was saying, little Hades! Brother Zeus is king of all the gods! And the most dashing, powerful, and hey, let's face it, *godliest *of all!


--- Poseidon With Athena 01 ---
Poseidon: As you can see by now, we are a big and clever family, little Hades! My niece Athena here being the cleverest of all. You'd never know that she was childless, the way she looks after and cares for all of us!
Athena: Surely my cleverness comes from your brother and yourself, Lord Uncle Poseidon. And I would only add, my feeling is we've more than enough children in this family, thus no further need for more of them, for now.


--- Poseidon With Ares 01 ---
Poseidon: Now, little Hades, you must know by now I've other nephews here, don't you? For instance, Ares comes to mind, the god of war! Some mighty wars have taken place at sea, is that not so?
Ares: Indeed, they have, good Uncle Poseidon. Mortals show great ingenuity when war is concerned; it drives their sense of progress, more than anything at all. Perhaps someday they shall wage war even in Father's skies.


--- Poseidon With Artemis 01 ---
Poseidon: The thing about me, Nephew, is I get along with everybody, here! A skill apparently that's rather rare! Take my niece Artemis, for instance! Can't ever take a simple jest, at all! You won't easily attract a mate with such a sour look about you, girl!
Artemis: Oh, and wouldn't that be such a pity, Uncle Poseidon. I wonder what could be the cause of this sour look that I perpetually have up here? Maybe Zagreus knows.
Poseidon: *Hahaha*! See exactly what I mean, Nephew?


--- Poseidon With Demeter 01 ---
Poseidon: My foster-sister Goddess Demeter, despite her stern approach, she often likes to make good sport of me, Nephew! Why, here she is right now!
Demeter: If you're quite finished blathering, Poseidon, our young Zagreus has more important things to do. He needs your blessings, not your point of view. Don't you, young sprout?


--- Poseidon Beat Theseus Quest Complete ---
Poseidon: *Ah-haha*! I knew that I could count on you, Nephew! So the ungrateful Theseus, the winsome prize he earned was just some chariot, correct? And he was vanquished on it, anyway! That's what he gets! Boasting his prize was greater than any in his mortal days, *pah*!


--- Poseidon Fish Quest Complete ---
Poseidon: *Ah-haha-hah*, little Hades, I was certain you'd the wherewithal to thin the ranks of the betraying river denizens who fled my surface-seas to your father's domain!! I bid you good fish-hunting forevermore!


--- Poseidon About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 ---
Zagreus: All right, here goes. In the name of Hades! Olympus! This is an official message! Uncle Poseidon, hope you can make this out.
Poseidon: What's this, Nephew? Why, isn't this a note? Or, part of one, addressed to me, but it appears there should be other pieces, for the others here? *Ah*, it's like a sunken treasure, then! Which means I must seek its mysteries at once!


--- Poseidon Post Epilogue 01 ---
Poseidon: You know, Nephew, I had a positively raucous time down there, with your old father, and Persephone, was she a sight! I never thought I'd see *her *again! So then, we're one big happy family, at last! But you've a job to do, and we upon Olympus, we'll do our fair share!


--- Poseidon About Zeus 01 ---
Poseidon: So, Nephew, my honored brother Zeus already has endowed you with his thunderous might? Well you shall soon forget about all that, after a taste of *this*!


--- Poseidon About Athena 01 ---
Poseidon: *Ahh*, you've received a blessing from Athena there already, little Hades! So careful all the time, that one, but here, I'll help you live a little, just in case!


--- Poseidon About Aphrodite 01 ---
Poseidon: *Oh-hoh*, so you've already heard from Aphrodite, have you, Nephew? Understandable, but first things first, now let me add a little something to all that!


--- Poseidon About Ares 01 ---
Poseidon: Hoy, Nephew! It's my understanding you've been blessed already by one of my *other *nephews, Ares! As you can see, not all of us are cut from the same cloth; and thank the Fates for that!


--- Poseidon About Artemis 01 ---
Poseidon: I sense that you've been marked by the elusive Artemis, correct, Nephew? She shies away from most of us, so if she's taken somewhat of a liking to you, great!


--- Poseidon About Dionysus 01 ---
Poseidon: Whenever Dionysus calls a feast, I'm turning up sooner or later, hear me, Nephew? So make room for one more blessing, and, let's go!


--- Poseidon About Hermes 01 ---
Poseidon: Little Hades, it appears that you are moving right along! Almost at an uncanny pace!! I wonder how you got to be so fast! Aquatic exercise?!


--- Poseidon About Hermes 02 ---
Poseidon: Nephew, how is it you're navigating your cruel father's realm at such a blinding speed?! There's only one Olympian who moves that quick! Besides myself! Where is he, anyway?


--- Poseidon About Demeter 01 ---
Poseidon: Why, little Hades, there's a certain chill about you, meaning you received an ice-cold blessing courtesy of Elder Goddess Demeter, correct? Now, personally, I think water's best in liquid form, but who am I to judge?


--- Poseidon Vs Zeus 01 ---
Poseidon: You've come to know your Uncle Zeus, by now, correct? Just want to let you know, good Zeus gets very busy on the regular, so you just stick with me, I've always time for you, Nephew!


--- Poseidon Backstory 01 ---
Poseidon: Nephew, your cruel father, Hades, he's my elder brother, you know that? Not exactly the expressive type, and never was. We seldomly saw eye-to-eye on things!


--- Poseidon Backstory 02 ---
Poseidon: I daresay, little Hades, you've some spunk in you! Why, I think you take after me more than my crusty elder brother! You'll get away from that old codger yet!


--- Poseidon Backstory 03 ---
Poseidon: My crusty elder brother Hades must have tried to poison you against us lot! I can imagine it as clear as water, Nephew! I'm proud that you've resisted his undoubtedly most-twisted words!


--- Poseidon Backstory 04 ---
Poseidon: Last time your father and I spoke, he told me I was all washed up, can you believe the nerve of it, Nephew? Why, he took the words right out of my mouth!


--- Poseidon About Powers 01 ---
Poseidon: It's likely, little Hades, that you currently reside just underneath one of my boundless seas! Normally you'd have to be submerged to use this power, but you know what, close enough!


--- Poseidon High Relationship 01 ---
Poseidon: You know I've many vitally important things to do besides lending my aid to you repeatedly, Nephew? But, all of that can wait! Family comes first!


--- Poseidon Max Relationship 01 ---
Poseidon: If you should ever make it here, Nephew, know this! I shall be pleased to stand in for the father figure I can tell you never really had. We can engage in all sorts of aquatic competitions, solve riddles, visit the sea-nymphs! Oh, it would be great, wouldn't you think?


--- Poseidon About Seas 01 ---
Poseidon: Nephew, why, the seas up here, they're just about as widely feared as your vast Underworld down there! For water can be deadlier than bronze!


--- Poseidon About Seas 02 ---
Poseidon: My oceans, they are filled with danger, not just water, little Hades! Many of the dead you face, they met their mortal end at sea, and not on land!


--- Poseidon Vs Meg 01 ---
Poseidon: *Ahh*, it seems to me you've had yourself a spot of lady trouble, lately, isn't that correct, Nephew? I mean the Fury down in Tartarus, of course! You going to let her keep on bossing you around?!


--- Poseidon Vs Meg 02 ---
Poseidon: *Hah*! I heard you showed that good-for-nothing Fury after all, I knew you'd handle that old crone, Nephew! And if she troubles you again, you just remind her who's in charge down there!


--- Poseidon Run Progress 01 ---
Poseidon: Good tidings, Nephew! I've learned that you have managed to get all the way to Asphodel, fine work! Now, you just keep on going!


--- Poseidon Run Progress 02 ---
Poseidon: *Ohh*, Nephew, you've stood against the Bull of Minos, have you? Well I must apologize for any inconvenience there, because, he was a living testament to my revenge! Long story, boring really, rather sordid, too. Stay strong!


--- Poseidon Run Progress 03 ---
Poseidon: Word reaches us that you've come very far, indeed, Nephew! Striking distance from the surface! You just keep at it like that, and with our help, we'll have you out of there for sure!


--- Poseidon Run Progress 04 ---
Poseidon: I wonder what monstrosities await you near the surface, little Hades? There's your father's terrifying hell-hound, for one thing! Ah, well, I'm sure you'll find a way to sail past whatever's in your way!


--- Poseidon Run Progress 05 ---
Poseidon: Now don't lose heart, Nephew! Because in spite of all your efforts, it is probably the case that you still have a long and painful road ahead!


--- Poseidon Run Cleared 01 ---
Poseidon: *Ah*, I thought for certain you were well on your way out of there last time, Nephew! But, no matter, we'll just get you on another voyage to the top!


--- Poseidon Run Cleared 02 ---
Poseidon: Little Nephew, why, I could have sworn you made it to the surface recently, and yet, you're all the way back there, again? Must be some sort of terrible monstrosity preventing your way out!


--- Poseidon Post Epilogue 02 ---
Poseidon: I'll tell you, Nephew, I was quite taken aback to learn Persephone, she was your mother all along! Just disappeared up here, one day! Ran off, I figured, as she's got some mortal blood in her. But she was with your father! That rascal is my brother, after all!


--- Poseidon Post Epilogue 03 ---
Poseidon: So how is crusty old Hades faring down there of late, Nephew? Fewer worries there upon his brow? That Underworld of yours all running smoothly, and all that? We'll keep on pitching in from over here. Least we can do!


--- Poseidon Post Epilogue 04 ---
Poseidon: Persephone, she says you're really stuck down there, born of the Underworld, something like that? Well, if you ask me, that's no kind of attitude to have! You can do *anything *you set your mind to, Nephew! Take it from me!


--- Poseidon Post Epilogue 05 ---
Poseidon: If you *do *ever get the opportunity to spend some time up here, Nephew, know I shall take you on a grand tour of the surface! From the depths of my seas to the height of Olympus! Sure, maybe not today, or tomorrow, or even the next aeon! But sometime, we should go!


--- Poseidon Post Epilogue 06 ---
Poseidon: Been nice to see my brothers getting on again, just like old times! Well, not exactly like old times, and come to think of it, there always was a bit of tension there between those two, but still! It's better than before!


--- Poseidon About Persephone Visit 01 ---
Poseidon: Your good mother Persephone, she's here all safe and sound, thought you should know, there, little Hades! Shame you can't be here with her, too, but *ah*! Doubtless we'll someday meet again!


--- Poseidon About Keepsake 01 ---
Poseidon: Ah-*hah*! I sense you have in your possession that fine shell I sent to you, a little gift plucked straight out of the sea! You keep it close so I can better track you down!


--- Poseidon Has Weapon 01 ---
Poseidon: My, my, little Hades, you brandish Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! That weapon's power was so terrifying that we sealed it away. Oh well! Surely its mortal-damning secrets shall be safely guarded in your hands!


--- Poseidon About Fist Weapon 01 ---
Poseidon: Huh! Why, if my eyes do not deceive me through those murky depths, you brandish *Malphon*! Let me tell you, little Hades, those old gloves have done some dirty work before your time!


--- Poseidon Has Weapon Upgrade 01 ---
Poseidon: Why, little Hades, it is awful murky where you are, but if I'm not mistaken, and I never am, you wield fearsome Stygius! She once belonged to me, you know! Not quite my type, but we sure had our times! You take good care of her for me!


--- Poseidon About Hades Aspect 01 ---
Poseidon: Say, is it me, or do you bear your father's ancient spear, Nephew? I always wanted one a bit like that. And now I have one even better. *Hah*!


--- Poseidon Low Health 05 ---
Poseidon: Your hated enemies, they almost got the best of you, I fear! But you can still turn it around, especially now that you have my aid!


--- Poseidon Low Health 05 ---
Poseidon: Your hated enemies, they almost got the best of you, I fear! But you can still turn it around, especially now that you have my aid!


--- Poseidon About Theseus 01 ---
Poseidon: Say, word has reached me that you squared against one known as Theseus, now champion there in Elysium? He was a handful even when he lived! So much so that my honored brother Zeus, he took to calling him my son, can you believe the nerve?


--- Poseidon About Theseus 02 ---
Poseidon: So, little Hades, doubtless you have seen that we upon Olympus also lend our favor to the mighty Theseus, who bars your passage from Elysium! Now, don't you take it personally, there, because our blessings go to *all *who deserve them. Although, we try to save the best for you!


--- Poseidon Beat Theseus Quest 01 ---
Poseidon: That scoundrel Theseus! Apparently he earned himself some sort of winsome prize, for all his blustering there in Elysium! Though, I'm quite certain that, no matter what he and his bull friend have at their disposal, you've the power to defeat them, utterly! So go do it, surely I'll get word!


--- Poseidon About Fishing 01 ---
Poseidon: Why, Nephew, you've procured the Rod of Fishing, I detect! Fine handiwork if I say so myself! Its line is nigh-invisible and causes denizens of my domain to flock to it like mortals to temples of mine! Good fortune with that thing!


--- Poseidon About Fishing 02 ---
Poseidon: I'm told a number of the underwater denizens from my domain were captured fair-and-square through your surpassing skill using the Rod of Fishing, little Hades!! They're yours, I've millions more!


--- Poseidon About Fishing 03 ---
Poseidon: All these river denizens you've caught, little Hades... it can only mean we share a deep connection, don't you think? I, with my power over the entire vastness of the seas! And you, with the power to ensnare a hapless fish with but a flick of the wrist!


--- Poseidon About Guan Yu Aspect 01 ---
Poseidon: Say, what exactly is that very mighty-looking spear I think I faintly see in your possession there, it's... why, I've not seen a thing like that except on very distant shores! It's almost as impressive as my trident here! *Almost*, I say!


--- Poseidon About Arthur Aspect 01 ---
Poseidon: You bear some sort of splendid-looking weapon, there, Nephew! Must be another aspect of fair Stygius, my old discarded blade! Never did see that one myself, but, I saw many others that were splendid, too!


--- Poseidon Low Health 01 ---
Poseidon: *Hoh*, you look positively in atrocious shape, there, Nephew! What's the matter, one too many run-ins with the wretched dead before *I *intervened?


--- Poseidon Low Health 02 ---
Poseidon: Seems to me that you're in dire straits, there, little Hades! Why, you're bleeding everywhere! Here, let me try and do something for that.


--- Poseidon Low Health 03 ---
Poseidon: *Ah*, what happened to you, little Hades?! I can tell even from here that you've been beaten like a skiff during a storm!


--- Poseidon Low Health 04 ---
Poseidon: Now, don't go dying on me, yet, Nephew! You have to *live*! Or else the Boon I offer you shall go to waste!


--- Poseidon Low Health 05 ---
Poseidon: Your hated enemies, they almost got the best of you, I fear! But you can still turn it around, especially now that you have my aid!


--- Poseidon First Pick Up ---
Zagreus: It's uncle number two, it's got to be. Then, in the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.
Poseidon: Hoy there, little Hades! You recognize your uncle, do you not? We've a lot of catching up to do, but first things first, you get yourself out of that dour Underworld! As for me, I'll see if I can *stir *things up a bit to cover your advance!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 01 ---
Poseidon: Hoy, Nephew, it's excellent to see you once again, and in good spirits, still? Then, come, let's make some waves!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 02 ---
Poseidon: Ahoy, little Hades, it is I! The greatest of your uncles! Here to aid you in your daringest escape attempt! And I do admire your persistence!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 03 ---
Poseidon: Good tidings once again, there, little Nephew!! It is I, returned as ever here to make a splash against your many, many foolish enemies!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 04 ---
Poseidon: Ahoy, Nephew! I bet you have your hands full dealing with your enemies down there, so let me see what I can do. And I can do a lot!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 05 ---
Poseidon: It seems you're getting somewhere, little Nephew! Good, but here, allow your favorite Uncle to bestow a little boost!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 06 ---
Poseidon: *Ah, hahaha! *Found you down there, Nephew! Now let's overwhelm your enemies in a typhoon of godly might, what do you say?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 07 ---
Poseidon: Little Hades, have I ever told you I detest the dead? Well, I admit it, I just cannot stand a mortal past his due. So how about we get you far away from all such filth, agreed?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 08 ---
Poseidon: What do you say, there, Nephew, ready to get wet, or no? Oh I suspect you are, so let's get to it, and dispense some liquid justice!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 09 ---
Poseidon: How fares your feud against my crusty elder brother lately, good? Big Hades, he is disagreeable with all of us, not just with you, so, don't you take it personal, and stick with me!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 10 ---
Poseidon: Looks like *you *could use the power of the sea, wouldn't you say so, little Hades? Good thing I'm here, so that together, we might wash your enemies away!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 11 ---
Poseidon: Enough kidding around without me, Nephew! I am here, so let's go bust you out, much like a raging river through a frail little dam!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 12 ---
Poseidon: You're looking somewhat stronger than before, there, little Nephew, but you're much too scrawny still, to be quite blunt. So, here! Let's fatten you right up!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 13 ---
Poseidon: *Hoy*, my nephew! I think I have kept you waiting long enough, so then, let's *go*! And break our enemies to pieces, like so many ships upon the shoals!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 14 ---
Poseidon: I'll have you know, the power of the seas themselves is yours once more, Nephew! So how about you put it to its rightful purpose, and go smash some stuff!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 15 ---
Poseidon: Are you perchance in need of godlike aid, Nephew? Well, excellent! Because I happen to command the sea, and I shall hereby let you take it for a whirl!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 16 ---
Poseidon: Who dares to mess with little Hades? You simply point me at them, Nephew, and we'll leave them shivering and sopping wet, you'll see!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 17 ---
Poseidon: At last I found you once again, Nephew! You eating well and getting strong, correct? I'll help you with the latter category in a moment. Here!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 18 ---
Poseidon: The awesome bounty of the sea is yours to do with as you please, Nephew! I've mustered forth a sample, anyway!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 19 ---
Poseidon: Hoh, little Hades! I'd heard you were preparing to rain terrible destruction on your enemies! So I got here as quickly as I could! I'm not too late, am I?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 20 ---
Poseidon: All of us must sail through troubled waters now and then, correct, Nephew? Fortunately, navigation is my speciality, so let's be on our way!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 21 ---
Poseidon: Your victory's most certainly at hand now that I'm here, Nephew! So long as you make sure to take advantage of the absolutely awesome power I bequeath!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 23 ---
Poseidon: Why, if it isn't the most favored of my nephews, stuck as ever though you may yet be! We'll get you from there, little Hades, don't despair, Uncle Poseidon's here!!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 24 ---
Poseidon: Good tidings, my most favored nephew! All is relatively well, I hope? But hope alone is worthless without action, is it not? So here, let's act *together*!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 25 ---
Poseidon: Just wait until you see the seas, Nephew! My underwater realm is the most glorious of the world's habitats. It positively teems with life, and it's much cooler there than in that sweaty Underworld of yours!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 26 ---
Poseidon: Well, Nephew, supposing it's high time for the high seas to lend their might once more?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 27 ---
Poseidon: Your uncle's offering to shake things up once more, what say you, little Hades?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 28 ---
Poseidon: No more dallying about, now, little Nephew! Time instead we really got somewhere!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 29 ---
Poseidon: Good tidings, little Hades! It is I! And I am always here to help!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 30 ---
Poseidon: Fear not, Nephew, it is I, your uncle! Come to wash away your troubles, here and now!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 31 ---
Poseidon: Just point me toward your enemies, Nephew, and they'll become sworn enemies of mine!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 32 ---
Poseidon: Let's get you out from underneath the sea, there, little Nephew!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup 33 ---
Poseidon: Ahoy, my godly Nephew, I've arrived, so set aside your worries and let's drench the dead!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 01 ---
Poseidon: How about we set you up here with some real *water*-power, little Hades?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 02 ---
Poseidon: I take it you could use some liquid courage at this time, no, little Hades?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 03 ---
Poseidon: How about a swim, there, little Hades? A swim, that is, within the Pool of Blessings! Now, dive in!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 04 ---
Poseidon: I'm here, Nephew, to aid you in your time of need, with *this*!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 05 ---
Poseidon: I heard that you could use the awesome power of the sea, Nephew!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 06 ---
Poseidon: Go on and make a splash for me, why don't you, little Hades!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 07 ---
Poseidon: The treasures of the sea are limitless, so here! You take your pick!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 08 ---
Poseidon: What do you say we make some waves, right, little Hades?


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 09 ---
Poseidon: Don't let the wretched dead dampen your spirits, little Hades! Dampen *theirs*!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 10 ---
Poseidon: Here comes another cool, refreshing blessing for you, Nephew!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 11 ---
Poseidon: Water can even cut through solid stone, with enough time! So you keep at it, there!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 12 ---
Poseidon: I know that you can do it, little Hades! Whatever it may be!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 13 ---
Poseidon: It's darker than the bottom of the sea in there! Are you alive, Nephew?!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 14 ---
Poseidon: The secrets of the sea can all be yours! Eventually at least, I have just three for now!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 15 ---
Poseidon: You still alive down there, Nephew? Because if so, why, this ought to keep it that way!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 16 ---
Poseidon: Must get so stuffy in that dreary place, Nephew! So why don't you cool off a bit, with *this*!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 17 ---
Poseidon: You have a dirty job down there, Nephew, but I can help you to clean up a bit!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Extra 18 ---
Poseidon: All that I ask, here, little Nephew, is for you to do your best! As I would do!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 01 ---
Poseidon: Ahoy, and now prepare yourself! For I've a rare treat here, especially for you!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 02 ---
Poseidon: I am ever impressed with your will to succeed, Nephew, so here! Great blessings be with you!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 03 ---
Poseidon: You've earned only the very finest of my blessings, little Hades! Why? Why *not*!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 04 ---
Poseidon: If you are ever going to get out of there, only the mightiest of all my blessings will suffice!


--- Poseidon Misc Pickup Rare 05 ---
Poseidon: My favorite Nephew ought have access to my greatest blessings, should he not?


--- Poseidon Loot Bought 01 ---
Poseidon: Ah-*hah*! You found me, little Nephew! Strewn among the inventories of that most disturbing river-boatman! That means you win my blessing!


--- Poseidon Loot Bought 02 ---
Poseidon: Well, well, my plan to get ahold of you via the boatman worked out flawlessly! Harness the might of the sea, then, why don't you?


--- Poseidon Loot Bought 03 ---
Poseidon: Well, Nephew, I know that salty Charon can be difficult. But I am certain that whatever price you paid, you got a *deal*!


--- Poseidon Loot Bought 04 ---
Poseidon: Nothing comes freely for the mortals on the surface, Nephew! And from the sound of things, it isn't any different with that Charon character!


--- Poseidon Loot Bought 05 ---
Poseidon: Let me just say, Nephew, that money-hoarding boatman best be fair with you! Because I'd hate to see anything happen to that little boat of his!


--- Poseidon Rejection 01 ---
Poseidon: *Whaaaa*, you think that you've a chance in hell without my help, am I to understand?! You made a big mistake there, little Hades, just you watch.


--- Poseidon Rejection 02 ---
Poseidon: How bold of you to throw your lot in with my relatives instead of me, given the choice, there, little Hades. But don't you ever bet against *this *horse!


--- Poseidon Rejection 03 ---
Poseidon: Oh, now, it seems to me your strength outweighs your smarts, there, Nephew, if you're prone to picking other sides than mine!


--- Poseidon Rejection 04 ---
Poseidon: A word of caution, little Nephew: Never turn your back against the sea. And, while you're at it, never take up sides against your greatest uncle!


--- Poseidon Rejection 05 ---
Poseidon: *Augh*! I'm absolutely flabbergasted, Nephew!! I offer you the finest blessings of the earth and sea, and they're not good enough?


--- Poseidon Rejection 06 ---
Poseidon: Apparently my crusty elder brother failed to teach you any manners, if you deign to thusly spurn my offerings! But I can teach you yet!


--- Poseidon Rejection 07 ---
Poseidon: *Betrayal*, little Hades!! Of all my nephews, you should know better than this! Or perhaps I should. One of us, at least!


--- Poseidon Rejection 08 ---
Poseidon: That's definitely not the choice *I *would have made, Nephew! Because, for me to side against myself, why, that would make no sense at all!


--- Poseidon Rejection 09 ---
Poseidon: Nephew, what you have just done is tantamount to spitting in my face! Let me remind you, then, the ocean can spit back!


--- Poseidon Rejection 10 ---
Poseidon: You wound me, little Hades, with your callous choice! It's fortunate I'm quite impervious to harm. But I don't think the same is true for you!


--- Poseidon Rejection 11 ---
Poseidon: You know the saying not to play with fire, don't you, Nephew? You'll find the same is very much the case with water, too!


--- Poseidon Rejection 12 ---
Poseidon: Again, you would defy me, little Hades? I'm beginning to see why your father might be very frustrated, indeed, having to deal with you!


--- Poseidon Rejection 13 ---
Poseidon: It seems that you require yet one more gentle reminder not to scoff at chances to accept my blessings, little Hades! Now remember this!


--- Poseidon Rejection 14 ---
Poseidon: Sometimes I think, surely my nephew takes to heart my strongly worded threats about my distaste for his little acts of treachery, but *no*!


--- Poseidon Rejection 15 ---
Poseidon: I could have sworn I told you never to take the power of the sea for granted, little Hades? It seems the time for words is over, then!


--- Poseidon Make Up 01 ---
Poseidon: Oh, very well then, little Hades! Uncle's going to let you off the hook this time. Just mind your manners next we meet!


--- Poseidon Make Up 02 ---
Poseidon: I must hand it to you, little Hades! I did not expect that you would weather such a storm! I'm mightily impressed!


--- Poseidon Make Up 03 ---
Poseidon: Ah, I can't stay angry! Let us call all that unpleasantness back there water under the bridge, what say you, Nephew?


--- Poseidon Make Up 04 ---
Poseidon: My, a show of strength like that deserves a commendation I should think! Although, for next time, know my favor's not a thing to trifle with!


--- Poseidon Make Up 05 ---
Poseidon: All right, that's quite enough, I take it you have had about enough of that, correct? You're pretty good! So here, why don't you run along!


--- Poseidon Make Up 06 ---
Poseidon: Oh, *hoh-hoh*, you've got some fire in you, don't you, little Hades? Here! I've just the thing to cool you down, fresh from my own domain!
Poseidon: *Ah-haha*, my fits of anger come and go just like the tides, Nephew! Now take this from me, and get out of here!


--- Poseidon Make Up 07 ---
Poseidon: Now that was truly finely fought, indeed, Nephew! And I've a suitable reward here, just for you! Don't even know what I was mad about!


--- Poseidon Make Up 08 ---
Poseidon: What can I say, Nephew? Sometimes our tempers get the best of all of us. You're fortunate mine didn't get the best of you back there!


--- Poseidon Make Up 09 ---
Poseidon: You weathered the storm, there, little Hades, and the sea is once again at peace. And you'll make every attempt to keep it that way, correct?


--- Poseidon Make Up 10 ---
Poseidon: All right, no need to fight about this any longer, don't you think, Nephew? Here, take my blessing, like you should have in the first place!


--- Poseidon Make Up 11 ---
Poseidon: Now let's not set a bad example for the family, Nephew! We're better than all that. Besides! They've many bad examples as it is.


--- Poseidon Gift 01 ---
Zagreus: Uncle Poseidon, it's been excellent to know you, sir, so, please, this is for you.
Poseidon: Oh I am positively moved by your affection, little Nephew! Though, I think I have just the thing for you, in turn! Here, I shall transfer it to you!!


--- Poseidon Gift 02 ---
Zagreus: Uncle Poseidon, this here is for you. Would that my father were as easygoing as yourself.
Poseidon: *Ah-hah*! A show of generosity from my most favored nephew! Your gift is mightily appreciated!! I'll just go ahead and add it to the pile.


--- Poseidon Gift 03 ---
Zagreus: Mighty Poseidon, greatest of my uncles, arguably, please accept this gift!
Poseidon: For all the times I'm offered gifts or sacrifices, little Nephew, I still always very much appreciate it! I mean, look! I'm grinning ear to ear!


--- Poseidon Gift 04 ---
Zagreus: Uncle Poseidon, I have a special catch for you! Although it pales next to your sheer awesomeness.
Poseidon: *Whaaa*, now would you look at that! Is that an offering to your most favored uncle, *me*? You know what, Nephew? I've decided I shall take it! Thanks!!


--- Poseidon Gift 05 ---
Zagreus: I salute you, Uncle Poseidon! Your strength and confidence inspire me, and you accepted me as part of the family without question. It means a lot.
Poseidon: *Ahh*, Nephew, but you needn't shower me with offerings and praise, you know! Why, I've no need of showering at all! Not when I've the sea itself, to do with as I please!


--- Poseidon Gift 06 ---
Zagreus: Whenever I encounter you, Uncle Poseidon, my spirits lift, and I feel there must not be anything that can stop me. I only wish we met sooner, though I'm grateful to have met you at all.
Poseidon: I thought I told you, Nephew, not to make such offerings to me? Ah, probably forgot! Or getting you mixed up, perhaps, for I have many other nephews, thanks to Zeus! Though, between us, I don't like any one of them as much as you!


--- Poseidon Gift 07 ---
Zagreus: Uncle Poseidon, sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like had you been a part of it sooner. Your encouragement, your enthusiasm... it means a lot. To you! This Ambrosia's been to hell and back!
Poseidon: *Hohhh*, but isn't this a kingly offering, indeed, my little Hades! I know how difficult it must have been to get, so distant from Olympus as you are! I'll never understand how come your father's cruel to you, for if you were my son, I would be proud! Proud anyway, but you get the idea.


--- Demeter With Poseidon 01 ---
Demeter: Ah, little sprout. I was just notifying Lord Poseidon here that all of his domain exists because it pleases me; remember, my good foster-brother, I could freeze your oceans solid if I chose.
Poseidon: *Ah, hahahah! *Excellently stated, venerable Goddess Demeter! I'm reminded once more of your vast experience, though, I think we all prefer our oceans liquidy, isn't that right, Nephew?!


--- Poseidon Wrath Intro 01 ---
Poseidon: I have to tell you something, little Hades: My relatives and I, we've been holding back one of our greatest gifts!! To see if you were worthy. And you are! My aid is yours, so call me if you need anything! Especially to smash your enemies to bits.


--- Poseidon Fish Quest 01 ---
Poseidon: Nephew! I'm mightily impressed with your ability to cull those rivers there of all the denizens of my domain! Your crusty father's not entitled to the bounties of the sea! But, on my limitless authority, you *are*! You have my Rod of Fishing... now have *this*!
