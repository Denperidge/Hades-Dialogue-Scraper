HermesAboutSkelly01|Hermes About Skelly 01|Hermes|I got a keen eye, boss, so I happened to notice that you've got a certain tooth you're carrying about. Know you're from the land of the dead and all, but don't you think that comes across as just a little odd?
HermesAboutPersephoneMeeting01|Hermes About Persephone Meeting 01|Hermes|Heard that you finally got out of there, Coz! Big congratulations due for that: Congrats! The secret's safe with me, of course! The others here, they think you're still at it. Though, I guess you are!

HermesExpectingMiscOlympian04|Hermes Expecting Misc Olympian 04|Hermes|I'm sure that keepsake that you brought will come in handy soon enough, there, boss!

HermesAboutPoseidon01|Hermes About Poseidon 01|Hermes|Want to bring you in on something, boss. Reason that Uncle Poseidon got to you before I did is, I let him. He's under the impression he's as spry as ever! *Hah!*
HermesAboutAthena01|Hermes About Athena 01|Hermes|So then Athena's looking out for you, that's good, that's good! She likes to put a lot of thought and stuff in everything, it's all a little much, if you ask me!
HermesAboutAres01|Hermes About Ares 01|Hermes|You know who keeps me awful busy, Coz? Ares. Nothing like a good old war amongst the mortals to create demand for lots and lots of messages to go around!
HermesAboutArtemis01|Hermes About Artemis 01|Hermes|Did Artemis manage to locate you already, boss? She's pretty good at that, I have to say. I'm faster! But she's fast, she's pretty fast, all right.
HermesAboutAphrodite01|Hermes About Aphrodite 01|Hermes|Aphrodite's really something, don't you think so, Coz? Normally I'd stop for no one here. But when it comes to her, exceptions must be made!
HermesAboutDionysus01|Hermes About Dionysus 01|Hermes|You ever get the feeling life's been moving all too quickly for you, boss? Well Dionysus doesn't, as you're probably aware. Throws quite a feast, though!
HermesAboutDemeter01|Hermes About Demeter 01|Hermes|Been downright chilly up here lately, Coz! We've Demeter to thank for that! Me, I try to stay out of her way, she doesn't think I'm of much help to her. Although I'm sure she's warmed to you at least!
HermesAboutHadesKeepsake01|Hermes About Hades Keepsake 01|Hermes|Say, isn't that your father's blessing on you, Coz?! I almost can't believe it, but you've done such a good job of things, how could he *not *approve?
HermesBackstory01|Hermes Backstory 01|Hermes|Whoa, what's good, there, Coz? Though, who am I kidding, we can cut the small talk. I don't mind. I interrupt my brothers and my sisters all the time!
HermesBackstory02|Hermes Backstory 02|Hermes|Boss, you've probably caught yourself thinking: *Hermes sure is quick! So how come it took so long for him to show up in the first place? *Well, I'm afraid that's not for you to know. But! It's not because I was late. Not late for anything.
HermesBackstory03|Hermes Backstory 03|Hermes|Hey, uh, could you do a little favor for me, Coz? My brothers, sisters, family, and whatnot, they're unaware I'm working with you, here. It's no big deal, but let's keep it that way for now. All right?
HermesBackstory04|Hermes Backstory 04|Hermes|Happened to be in the area, boss! Seeing as the mortal folk up here keep dying off, and someone's got to bring their souls to your domain, now, don't they.
HermesBackstory05|Hermes Backstory 05|Hermes|Know that saying *'don't be hasty'*, boss? That comes from me. I swear! A little way to stave off competition, masquerading as the wisdom of a sage. Those stupid mortals will buy anything!
HermesBackstory06|Hermes Backstory 06|Hermes|Not that I really know *exactly *what you're up to, Coz, but! If I did, I don't think anybody on Olympus is aware of it. Or, if they are, they're keeping their mouths shut. The same as me!
HermesBackstory07|Hermes Backstory 07|Hermes|You ever wonder how I got this fast, Coz? Lots of practicing, I'll tell you that! And being born unnaturally quick, I guess!
HermesAboutSkinnyLittleChap01|Hermes About Skinny Little Chap 01|Hermes|Once took a skinny little chap down to the Underworld, got the business end of a sharp spear, he did! He had it coming, though, a lot of lying, cheating, and the like. Last that I heard, he's still making his amends down there. *Eh*!
HermesAboutSkelly02|Hermes About Skelly 02|Hermes|Boss, I know you've heard a certain rumor from a very skinny individual who's uninclined to move. You best keep that one to yourself, all right? Or else our jig is up, and your father wouldn't like that, nor would you. So, cheers!
HermesAboutSkelly03|Hermes About Skelly 03|Hermes|Say, you're in good with what's-his-name, the one who gave you his lucky tooth? So he's an all-right sort, then. Has to be, if you put up with him!
HermesAboutSecretService01|Hermes About Secret Service 01|Hermes|So, now you've found me out, haven't you, Coz? Heard from the big boat-man himself. Well, good! We're pleased to be of service. And *we've *got a lot of dirt on *you*, so you be sure to keep our secrets, too. All right?
HermesAboutSecretService02|Hermes About Secret Service 02|Hermes|So my professional associate, the fearsome boatman on the River Styx? You got to know him pretty well in all of this, right, Coz?

HermesAboutMegRelationship01|Hermes About Meg Relationship 01|Hermes|Heard you've been seeing the Fury, Megaera, Coz? Got the impression she was quite a handful, though I guess the same can probably be said of you, there, huh? You two have fun!
HermesAboutCharonFight01|Hermes About Charon Fight 01|Hermes|I can't believe you got into a fight with my professional associate, you daft or something, Coz? Just about everybody that I know, they're all at least a little bit afraid of that one and his boat, yet you think you can take him, huh?
HermesAboutCharonFight02|Hermes About Charon Fight 02|Hermes|So you took on my good professional associate, is that right, Coz? And you beat the big boatman himself! I knew you were pretty tough, but not *that *tough! Impressive work! He's impressed, too. He isn't even mad!
HermesBeatCharonQuest01|Hermes Beat Charon Quest 01|Hermes|Hey, uh, so I kind of placed a bet with the old boatman, my associate that is, that you could beat him in a fight, twice in a row! No pressure, or anything, but just in case you prove me right one of these days, I would appreciate it, Coz!
HermesMessage01|Hermes Message 01|Hermes|Message from Olympus for you, boss! It says, *'It sure is nice up here upon this mountain, not having to escape the Underworld! Come join us soon, won't you?'*
HermesMessage02|Hermes Message 02|Hermes|Message for you, boss. It says, *'You're rather slow. If only somebody could help you out with that.' *Huh, fancy that, what a coincidence!

HermesRunProgress01|Hermes Run Progress 01|Hermes|You know, Coz, all this time that I've been bussing souls across the borders of your father's land, it's good to have the chance to help somebody out the other way!
HermesSquelch01|Hermes Squelch 01|Hermes|Hey, Coz, you're now well accustomed to our little chats, but I want you to level with me here. You're the boss, if you prefer, I would be happy to shut up, no harm no foul. Just give the signal, hey?

HermesAboutThanatos01|Hermes About Thanatos 01|Hermes|You're pretty close with Thanatos, aren't you, boss? We don't often run in the same lanes, though our duties sometimes intersect a bit. Odd chap. Seems good at what he does, though!

HermesPostEpilogue03|Hermes Post Epilogue 03|Hermes|Even though everything's out in the open, now, and all my brothers, sisters, and whatnot are going to keep helping you fight your way out of there, I've still been keeping to myself, of late! That way nobody slows me down.
HermesPostEpilogue04|Hermes Post Epilogue 04|Hermes|Some members of the family up here, I know they haven't helped at all, but just don't take it personal or anything, all right? Think of it this way: You've got more of us getting along and talking properly than I have ever *seen*!

HermesLootBought01|Hermes Loot Bought 01|Hermes|Why, hello, Coz! Odd that we're running into one another here! Among the wares of my professional associate, I mean. Must be some sort of clerical mistake!
HermesLootBought01_B|Hermes Loot Bought 01 B|Hermes|Why, hello, boss! Odd that we're running into one another here! Among the wares of my professional associate, I mean. Must be some sort of clerical mistake!
HermesLootBought02|Hermes Loot Bought 02|Hermes|You're well familiar with my professional associate, there, with the boat? Souls of the recently departed got to make it over to the Underworld somehow. Part of my job! I bring them in, he takes them down.
HermesLootBought03|Hermes Loot Bought 03|Hermes|I guess I'm used to these one-sided chats here, boss, thanks to my work experience with my professional associate down there! You tell him I said hi, all right?
HermesLootBought04|Hermes Loot Bought 04|Hermes|A word of caution, Coz. Don't ask too many questions about me, or my professional associate down there. I hand souls over to him, and that's it, you understand?
HermesLootBought05|Hermes Loot Bought 05|Hermes|Wouldn't you know it, boss! I was just minding my own business, handing off a few dearly departed souls to my professional associate, and who shows up, but *you*?
HermesLootBought06|Hermes Loot Bought 06|Hermes|My heavy-breathing professional associate was gracious enough to drop me off here with his other stuff, and for quite an affordable price, at that!
HermesLootBought07|Hermes Loot Bought 07|Hermes|All right, then, let's go make that spend of hard-earned coin well worth your while! What do you think, Coz?
HermesLootBought08|Hermes Loot Bought 08|Hermes|I'd tell you not to ask too many questions of my good professional associate nearby, but then, *who are we kidding*, boss? Not like he'd answer you those questions anyhow!
HermesLootBought09|Hermes Loot Bought 09|Hermes|Message for you, boss, from my professional associate, who wanted you to know, and I quote, *'Hhhrrrrnnnngggggghhhhhh.'*
HermesLootBought10|Hermes Loot Bought 10|Hermes|Been working with my good professional associate, the boatman there, since I-don't-know-how-long. Though, let me tell you, Coz, we haven't had a job quite like this yet!
HermesLootBought11|Hermes Loot Bought 11|Hermes|Among the many ways in which you could parlay your earnings into better chances of survival here, I'm flattered you would think of me this time!
HermesLootBought12|Hermes Loot Bought 12|Hermes|How strange of a coincidence that you keep running into me along the riverside like this, don't you agree, there, Coz?
HermesLootBought13|Hermes Loot Bought 13|Hermes|Don't normally go selling off my blessings to the highest bidder, boss, but your bid there is good enough for me!
HermesGift01|Hermes Gift 01|Zagreus|Lord Hermes, please accept this gift as a small token of my appreciation. Thank you for always keeping me on my toes.
HermesGift01|Hermes Gift 01|Hermes|*Oh*! Mighty keen of you to leave a tip, there, boss. And I've a tip for you: Don't be slow! Maybe this will help with that.
HermesGift02|Hermes Gift 02|Zagreus|Lord Hermes sir, you've asked for nothing in return, and so, please take this humble offering, because... it's nothing, really!
HermesGift02|Hermes Gift 02|Hermes|Well now, that's awful kind, there, Coz! No need to thank me, though. Not so profusely anyhow!
HermesGift03|Hermes Gift 03|Zagreus|Hermes, my friend? May I call you my friend? I hope this modest offering will lift your spirits but won't slow you down.
HermesGift03|Hermes Gift 03|Hermes|I look like I got the sort of time to sip Nectar, Coz? Well, guess what, I do! So, cheers!
HermesGift04|Hermes Gift 04|Zagreus|Ever since we met, Lord Hermes, life here in the Underworld has been much faster-paced, and I am ever grateful. This is for you.
HermesGift04|Hermes Gift 04|Hermes|Hey, boss, I appreciate the tip. But just as a reminder, all my services are paid in full already! No need for special thanks. Though... cheers.
HermesGift05|Hermes Gift 05|Zagreus|I never could have come this far this quickly had it not been for your tireless support, Lord Hermes, sir. I'm in your debt.
HermesGift05|Hermes Gift 05|Hermes|You know, Coz, I got to say I had a few concerns when we first met, your father being who he is and all. But you're all right!
HermesGift06|Hermes Gift 06|Zagreus|This one's for you, swift and sure-footed messenger of the gods! You make what you do look easy. But I know you're going out of your way. Thank you so much, Hermes.
HermesGift06|Hermes Gift 06|Hermes|My rule is not to let things get too personal as far as work-related matters are concerned, Coz. But you're family! And, well, you're a right decent chap, I think. Offering up a bit of Nectar to me in the middle of all this!
HermesGift07|Hermes Gift 07|Zagreus|I salute you, Lord Hermes, with this rarest of delicacies! Pretty rare here, anyway. You never show it, but I can only imagine how hard you must be working to back me up. Cheers, mate!
HermesGift07|Hermes Gift 07|Hermes|You know, the last time anybody offered me Ambrosia from the Underworld was *never*, before now! That's quite a gesture on your part. You could have just as well taken my services for granted and I'd not have minded in the least! But, thank you, Coz.
HermesGift08|Hermes Gift 08|Zagreus|Message for you, Lord Hermes! It says, *'This offering is dedicated to the incomparable god of swiftness, from whom the news is always good, because he's bringing it. You are a real mate, you know that? I really owe you one.' *Zagreus.
HermesGift08|Hermes Gift 08|Hermes|Look, Coz, I am going to accept this choice Ambrosia from you one last time, all right? But from this point, I am doubling down on all professional responsibilities, here. Strictly business between us! Although, secretly, you're one of my best mates. Want you to know.
