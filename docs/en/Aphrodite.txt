--- Duo - Zeus and Aphrodite (1) ---
Zeus: Young man, I know you'd like to get to know the comely Aphrodite face to face, or I don't know, you can decide once you arrive at last! He can decide, isn't that right, my Lady Aphrodite, hm?
Aphrodite: Why, I never, Lord Zeus! That sounded rather like a crass remark, from *you*! How shocking that the golden standard for the rest of us should have such words for *me*!


--- Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (1) ---
Ares: I so anticipate the day you finally arrive upon Olympus. There are few amongst us here with interests such as those I think we share.
Aphrodite: There are at least a few of us who share such interests here, isn't that so, Lord Ares? As for *you*, dearest, you take all the time you need!


--- Duo - Ares and Aphrodite (2) ---
Ares: Wars waged over love, my kin... can you imagine that? The lady Aphrodite and I can endlessly discuss such circumstances. I trust, from time to time, you stop to ask yourself how come you choose to fight. Not that you need a reason, of course.
Aphrodite: Oh, Lord Ares, truly there isn't the need to cloud our little godling's thoughts and judgment with such comments, is there, *hm*? Let's give him what he wants, and we can carry on in private, about that.


--- Duo - Artemis and Aphrodite (1) ---
Artemis: Hey, *uh*, Zagreus! There's something I've been wondering, and don't take this the wrong way or anything, OK? Oh, no. It's her.
Aphrodite: Why, Artemis, you're absolutely tongue-tied! Due to our little godling in the Underworld, or a little due to me? *Hm-hm*, you shall figure it all out I'm sure!
Artemis: Look, what was I, *ugh*, just, never mind. I'll talk to you some other time, I guess.


--- Duo - Artemis and Aphrodite (2) ---
Artemis: *Erm*, Zagreus, despite my hunter's instincts here, it seems I was unable to elude Aphrodite in this particular case, who insisted that we present ourselves to you at the same time, for whatever reason...
Aphrodite: Oh, come now, Artemis! I'm sure you're very capable of hiding from a common beast, but I can see you plain. Why not be honest with yourself, next time?


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Zeus (1) ---
Aphrodite: Dearest, your lord uncle wishes to address you from our mountaintop, although I had assured him that the two of us, we had everything well under control!
Zeus: Come now, Zagreus, the only thing Lady Aphrodite has under control is her long list of salivating suitors, am I right? Aphrodite, how about you bestow your blessing and be off, and I'll take it from here.


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Poseidon (1) ---
Aphrodite: The thing to know about this family, dearest, is that, each of us, we have our little quirks. Although, we always stick together and our love for one another perseveres!
Poseidon: Oh, *hoh*! What do we have here, little Hades? Seems to me that you have *company*! Well, I'll just leave the two of you alone. My lips are sealed tighter than a warship hull!
Aphrodite: Oh, feel free to stay, Poseidon! I was just explaining what an idiot you are, though you're able to articulate this best! Anyway, dearest, what was I on about...?


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Athena (1) ---
Aphrodite: You must forgive us, little godling, meaning our extended family here upon Olympus! Some of us are terribly stuck up, and must be making matters much more complicated than they have to be.
Athena: I wonder, dearest Aphrodite, whether you'd be willing to repeat such things directly to my countenance?
Aphrodite: Oh, you must know full well that I would do much more than that directly to your countenance, Athena dear! Quite frankly, you could use a lot of work!


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Athena (2) ---
Aphrodite: Dearest, you must know, Goddess Athena and myself, we don't always share a common view, perhaps because she overthinks things constantly, while my heart leads me on!
Athena: I'm glad we understand each other, then. It would be most embarrassing to be caught bickering amongst ourselves in front of Zagreus.


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Ares (1) ---
Aphrodite: I think for many of us, dearest, it can come as a surprise to learn that love and war often go hand in hand. Opposite forces, yet this connects them, doesn't it. The fiercest passions of gods and mortals! Isn't that right, Lord Ares?
Ares: Mortals are so bent on clinging to their lives, that many among them would gladly kill for it. The surge of emotion which they feel... one passion is no different from another, Lady Aphrodite, dear.


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Artemis (1) ---
Aphrodite: Oh dearest! I have brought you keen-eyed Artemis, who, in her focus on the hunt, has not developed social graces suitable enough to come to you herself!
Artemis: Social graces, she says! Going about like *that*! I'm sure you know that I can find you when it's necessary, Zagreus. Though, how to get away from Aphrodite, I have no idea.


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Dionysus (1) ---
Aphrodite: My powers, dearest, oft go hand-in-hand with those of Dionysus, with his power to persuade the mind to find such beauty where it isn't, really!
Dionysus: *Ah, haha*, no need to flatter me like that, there, Lady Aphrodite! Beauty's almost entirely within the mind, I'm sure! And in the muscles and the jawline and the winning smile and, well, who am I to tell you, yeah?


--- Duo - Aphrodite and Demeter (1) ---
Aphrodite: The venerable goddess of the seasons, Demeter, chooses to look as stately as can be, can you believe it, dearest? Although, why one would mark so many fine lines upon their face, I wouldn't know.
Demeter: Oh, Aphrodite, dear... you wouldn't know a thing of substance if it offered you a cloak. Your chosen countenance makes plain the full extent of your intentions, and your interests alike.


--- Aphrodite About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 ---
Zagreus: OK, I think I'm ready. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! And I hope it finds you well, Lady Aphrodite!
Aphrodite: Why, *this *is something, dearest! Such an enigmatic message you have sent. How positively captivating; I must know what it says. It bears the marks of others on Olympus, so... perhaps we ought to share some common knowledge on the subject, hm?


--- Aphrodite Post Epilogue 01 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, dearest, you've no idea what a delightful time I had while visiting you recently! So many new sights and sounds and smells, why, it was wonderful! And you are burdened with a big responsibility, aren't you? Mind if I lend my graces to you still from time to time...?


--- Aphrodite About Zeus 01 ---
Aphrodite: Lord Zeus has made acquaintances with you? Oh I sometimes forget that he's your uncle! His favor's well worth having, I assure you.


--- Aphrodite About Poseidon 01 ---
Aphrodite: That oaf Poseidon spoke to you already, didn't he? All bluster, muscles, and bravado, that one. I'm glad you're not the type.


--- Aphrodite About Athena 01 ---
Aphrodite: You've met Athena, dearest, so you know not all the ladies on Olympus are alike. And I, for one, am grateful to our forebears for *that*!


--- Aphrodite About Ares 01 ---
Aphrodite: I sense the mark of my Lord Ares on you, love. He's poorly understood among the gods, yet surely you can see fair qualities in him, and me?


--- Aphrodite About Artemis 01 ---
Aphrodite: The sullen Artemis reached out to you, did she? Oh, that's adorable, dearest! Just don't make any sudden movements with her, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite About Dionysus 01 ---
Aphrodite: You are so fortunate to have received the Boon of Dionysus prior to my own! He, the most noble and important of us all, the god of wine, himself!


--- Aphrodite About Demeter 01 ---
Aphrodite: Why, did sorrowful old Demeter get all the way to you before I did? She stubbornly refuses me when I offer to help! Unlike you, little godling!


--- Aphrodite Post Gift Pickup 01 ---
Aphrodite: How I *love *to have these unexpected little run-ins with you, love! You are just so spontaneous, and I've a liking for that sort of thing!


--- Aphrodite Post Gift Pickup 02 ---
Aphrodite: Keep following that heart of yours, dearest! It's good enough a guide, believe you me. Mine tells me you are going to succeed!


--- Aphrodite Post Gift Pickup 04 ---
Aphrodite: You *do *know that I'm married, don't you, love...? I'd forgive you if you didn't, for my husband, he's always... busy with his work. I'm grateful that you're there for me to talk to.


--- Aphrodite Post Flashback 01 ---
Aphrodite: You're going to love it on Olympus, little godling. The air is beautiful and brisk, the gardens lush, the feasting plentiful...! Why, it must be the opposite of everything to which you are accustomed!


--- Aphrodite Post Flashback 02 ---
Aphrodite: What shall we do here once you finally arrive? Perhaps we could go out and meet some *mortals*! I know all too many maidens and/or noble gentlemen who'd absolutely love to get to know you.


--- Aphrodite Vs Achilles 01 ---
Aphrodite: A little bird once told me that the shade of the great hero called Achilles now resides within your father's residence, dearest? I always wished to meet with him someday...


--- Aphrodite Vs Achilles 02 ---
Aphrodite: You met Achilles after all, godling. He was quite instrumental in a war of my design. Still, he resisted my attempts to sway his actions. You tell him, simply, I admire him.


--- Aphrodite Vs Achilles 03 ---
Aphrodite: The great hero Achilles, he continues to ignore my polite outreach, doesn't he? Why, I've attempted to reach out at least several times! Your father's realm is really quite a lot. How terribly frustrating it must be!


--- Aphrodite Vs Meg 01 ---
Aphrodite: You've had a brush with Megaera, the Fury, haven't you? Oh I know a thing or two about that one. Though, lately we Olympians no longer mingle with those living in the Underworld. You're the only exception!


--- Aphrodite Vs Meg 02 ---
Aphrodite: A little birdy told me recently that you and Megaera the Fury, why, you've grown quite close! Now *do *be careful around her, and, try not to get attached, there, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite About Keepsake 01 ---
Aphrodite: Why, you have my Eternal Rose, don't you? I am so very touched that you'd think first of me among my mighty kin. It pleases me to know I'm in your thoughts!


--- Aphrodite Run Cleared 01 ---
Aphrodite: Oh what is going *on *down there, dearest? I thought for certain you would make it out, but seems that nasty place has kept you grounded, hasn't it. But don't despair, and you take heart, won't you?


--- Aphrodite About Persephone Meeting 01 ---
Aphrodite: Something has stirred within your heart, dearest! Oh, I can always tell! A certain kind of love, for family? Yes, that must be it, I think! What could have transpired with you, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Post Epilogue 02 ---
Aphrodite: To think your father and that sweet Persephone, they were together down there, all along! I was so certain that your father's heart was cold. That's just the thing with love, dearest! That, sometimes, it surprises even me!


--- Aphrodite High Affinity 01 ---
Aphrodite: My dearest little godling, how fares everything with you of late? I love to have these little interactions with you, simple as they are, for they have brightened many of my evenings here.


--- Aphrodite About Love 01 ---
Aphrodite: Little godling, you must know the seven types of love by now, don't you? It's quite a complicated field, though several types intrigue me most of all. In fact, why, I have several types of love for you, right here!


--- Aphrodite About Love 02 ---
Aphrodite: Dearest, why... I sense your heart is very full, indeed! You positively emanate with love. You must have grown quite close to many dear to you. Perhaps so you may do the same with me...? I'm so delighted to have seen your spirit shine.


--- Aphrodite About Love 03 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, my, dearest! I have to say, your heart is positively bursting with such love for so many you have come to care about! Your dearest friends, your burning passions, family, *everyone*! Why, you're like a living testament to my entire body of work!


--- Aphrodite Backstory 01 ---
Aphrodite: I cannot help but wonder, dearest, why Lord Hades would have kept your mere existence hidden from us all this time. Perhaps he knew that, once you met us, you would stop at nothing to come seek us out!


--- Aphrodite About Meg Relationship 01 ---
Aphrodite: I sense you finally acted on your pent-up passion for the Fury Megaera, yes, little godling? These types of things, they don't escape my notice, and they're always so enjoyable to see!


--- Aphrodite About Meg Relationship 02 ---
Aphrodite: How's fearsome Megaera the Fury treating you of late, *hmm*, dearest? I know her type so very well, indeed. She acts as though there's nothing that can get under her skin, isn't that right?


--- Aphrodite About Than Relationship 01 ---
Aphrodite: *Mmm*, so my heart tells me that you've developed quite the bond with moody Thanatos, haven't you, there? I always figured that his brooding quality was just an act!


--- Aphrodite About Than Relationship 02 ---
Aphrodite: Little godling, would that I knew every last detail of how you and Thanatos are getting on of late! The notorious incarnate of death, and the newly discovered son of Hades, fraternizing? It's positively scandalous I think!


--- Aphrodite About Dusa Relationship 01 ---
Aphrodite: *Erm*, dearest? If my perfectly developed senses are correct, then you appear to be quite smitten with a little gorgon that you've met down there...? Why that must be adorable, if rather strange!


--- Aphrodite About Dusa Relationship 02 ---
Aphrodite: Why, something's changed about the beating of your heart, dearest! *Oh*, it's the little gorgon, isn't it. You Underworld dwellers and your complicated feelings! I can never get enough. My blessings to the both of you, then, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Low Health 01 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, look at you, you poor, poor thing, you're hurt! Though, let me see if I can make it better.


--- Aphrodite Low Health 02 ---
Aphrodite: *Tsk*, you're in no condition for an outing with me, dearest. Though, perhaps you might recover from your hardships with my aid?


--- Aphrodite Low Health 03 ---
Aphrodite: Dearest, why, your heart rate's fluctuating wildly! Has it really been that bad up to this point? I'll try to help however much I can.


--- Aphrodite Low Health 04 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, you're just in an awful situation, aren't you. Yet, I can tell your proud heart keeps on beating, for the moment anyway! Don't die just yet!


--- Aphrodite Low Health 05 ---
Aphrodite: Ah, little godling, you're about to die! Why, none of us want *that*, because if so, you won't get to enjoy my blessings here!


--- Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 01 ---
Aphrodite: I have been waiting for a special moment to confess my great appreciation for your deeds... this moment's special enough, isn't it?


--- Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 02 ---
Aphrodite: My loveliest of blessings is reserved only for those who've earned my deepest adoration. So, congratulations, love! And here you go!


--- Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 03 ---
Aphrodite: Sometimes, our hearts become so full that they could burst! If only you could see how much I care. I would do anything to aid you in your plight! My heartfelt blessings be with you, dearest.


--- Aphrodite Legendary Pick Up 04 ---
Aphrodite: Little godling, you must know that the heart has infinite capacity for empathy. And I so feel for you there, that I have mustered for you some of the most beautiful of blessings I can offer!


--- Aphrodite First Pick Up ---
Zagreus: I must be a mess, let's see here. Hi there! In the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.
Aphrodite: Why hello, hello, there, little godling. I have to say you're quite the specimen, and so, I've decided I shall aid you for the moment. You interested?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 01 ---
Aphrodite: Did you miss me, little godling, *hm*? I thought I'd steal away a bit and that together we might make up for lost time.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 02 ---
Aphrodite: Hello again, there, little godling, let's get to it, *hm*? I want what you want; there's no further need for words.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 03 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, boo, looks like you've rather got yourself into a bind, there, haven't you. Though, not to worry, dearest. I can pull some strings.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 04 ---
Aphrodite: There, there, dearest, you'll tell me all your troubles just as soon as you arrive, so let's just get you out of there for now.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 05 ---
Aphrodite: What is it, love, are you still having problems with the dead? I swear, you'd think they had enough of me in life!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 06 ---
Aphrodite: What did I miss since last time, anything of interest, *hm*? You'll have to fill me in once you break free, dearest.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 07 ---
Aphrodite: Well, look at you, there, love! So well-prepared to take on any danger that may come! But, I must wonder, are you well-prepared for *this*?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 08 ---
Aphrodite: Ready yourself, dearest, because you and I? We're going to have ourselves a little outing I expect that neither one of us shall soon forget.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 09 ---
Aphrodite: Would you by any chance have room, there, in your heart for a most-gentle blessing from a goddess such as me?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 10 ---
Aphrodite: Don't lose heart, now, little godling! I won't have you giving up before you get to see me in the flesh among the gardens of Olympus here...!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 11 ---
Aphrodite: Dearest, I've known many gods and godlings through the ages. And, I have to say, you're *quite *intriguing, even for our kind.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 12 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, dearest, I suspect we'll have ourselves a most exciting time together, you and I! Just do your best and it'll all be fine!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 13 ---
Aphrodite: I am always here, or close enough, to help you through whatever troubles you may face, my little godling. So do not hesitate to call upon me, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 14 ---
Aphrodite: I'd ask you show me a good time, there, love, although I almost can't imagine a good time where you reside! So dreary, constantly!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 15 ---
Aphrodite: I missed you terribly, my little godling! All that I ask is that you do not die on me again, why, I don't think that I can take it anymore!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 16 ---
Aphrodite: How you must yearn to reach the surface, little godling! It likewise stirs in me a yearning to assist you, by all means at my disposal!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 17 ---
Aphrodite: No need to worry any longer, dearest! I bring you strength and comfort, and I shall be watching every step of yours most carefully.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 18 ---
Aphrodite: Ah, how I long to see you face-to-face! Until such time, however, this old means of keeping touch shall have to do. So you take care, now, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 19 ---
Aphrodite: You know I would do anything to have you here among us, don't you, love? Oh, I just hope my blessings are enough...!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 20 ---
Aphrodite: Love tends to blossom in the strangest places at the strangest times, you know that, don't you, dearest? All one can do is entertain the chance.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 21 ---
Aphrodite: Don't work yourself too hard down there, you promise, little godling? We need you in good shape and spirits on Olympus here.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 22 ---
Aphrodite: What do you say we skip the chat and get right to it, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 23 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, would you look at whom I found, all by his lonely self.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 24 ---
Aphrodite: Let's see what mischief we can make, between the two of us!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 25 ---
Aphrodite: You want my blessings, dearest, here they are!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 26 ---
Aphrodite: I hope I didn't keep you waiting very long, did I?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 27 ---
Aphrodite: Even immortal hearts can break, my little godling.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 28 ---
Aphrodite: What do you say we go and make new friends together, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 29 ---
Aphrodite: You seem like you could use a helping hand, there, love.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 30 ---
Aphrodite: The bond of love is strong enough to suffer any hardship, dearest.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 31 ---
Aphrodite: Times of adversity make love grow even stronger, little godling.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 32 ---
Aphrodite: I hate to see you struggling, dearest! Please do be careful, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 33 ---
Aphrodite: Love conquers everything, you see that, don't you, dearest?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 34 ---
Aphrodite: Think of all those you love, and may they spur your courage, little godling.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 35 ---
Aphrodite: Your passion to achieve your goal is quite inspiring, I have to say!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 36 ---
Aphrodite: It's such a pity I can barely see you in that awful darkness, little godling.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 37 ---
Aphrodite: Love spurs the heart to greater acts of valor, doesn't it, dearest?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 38 ---
Aphrodite: Take heart, now, little godling. And how about you take this from me, as well.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup 39 ---
Aphrodite: I'd love to help you however best I'm able, my little godling.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 01 ---
Aphrodite: I have the loveliest selection of my blessings for you this time, dearest!


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 02 ---
Aphrodite: I think I'll give you something very special this time, little godling.


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 03 ---
Aphrodite: Is not the purest act of love to aid somebody in their time of need?


--- Aphrodite Misc Pickup Rare 04 ---
Aphrodite: I'm feeling wonderful of late, dearest, so here, enjoy the benefits!


--- Aphrodite Loot Bought 01 ---
Aphrodite: Looks like we meet again, dearest, here among the foul detritus of the boatman's wares! You truly take me to the best of places!


--- Aphrodite Loot Bought 02 ---
Aphrodite: At first I didn't know how to get through to that odd river-boatman, Charon. Turns out he lusts for coin, and now I understand him well!


--- Aphrodite Loot Bought 03 ---
Aphrodite: You spent your hard-earned wealth on my account, dearest? Why if that isn't just the sweetest thing!


--- Aphrodite Loot Bought 04 ---
Aphrodite: One cannot put a price on love, but on my blessings, from the boatman, for my dearest? I'd say we're settled up.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 01 ---
Aphrodite: And here I was beginning to think that we had something special going, no...? Look here, little godling, let me save you lots of future suffering: I happen to be the jealous type.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 02 ---
Aphrodite: You'd best not take for granted my affection, godling. Yes, I've lots of it to go around; but I can just as easily rescind such privileges.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 03 ---
Aphrodite: They say a lot of things about me, dearest; and they'll tell you, in your dealings with me, ample caution is in order. Let me show you why.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 04 ---
Aphrodite: Don't *ever *take me for some thoughtless nymph to be manipulated, dearest. I expect reciprocal devotion from you. Do you understand?


--- Aphrodite Rejection 05 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, *really*? You shall find I don't take such rejections lying down. And you shall find it out the hard way.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 06 ---
Aphrodite: If it's your wish to test the limits of the fine relationship we've built, why then... I can confirm you're testing them, all right!


--- Aphrodite Rejection 07 ---
Aphrodite: Now, dearest... surely there's no way that could have been one of the wiser choices that you've lately made?


--- Aphrodite Rejection 08 ---
Aphrodite: Dearest, just in case it hasn't been made clear as crystal lately, let me tell you: When presented with the opportunity, don't *ever *reject me.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 09 ---
Aphrodite: You'd spurn my love this easily, dearest? You are about to find the consequences are much harder to dismiss without a second thought.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 10 ---
Aphrodite: I must admit I'm unaccustomed to rejection, love. But *you *must be accustomed to swift death! Here comes one for you now.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 11 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, but this is such a heartbreak, dearest! Why would you do that? You know that I won't take this lying down.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 12 ---
Aphrodite: You *dare *to play with *my *heart, little godling? I'll just take yours, and shatter it to pieces, then, I think!


--- Aphrodite Rejection 13 ---
Aphrodite: Sometimes I think that you're quite *different *than most all the others here, darling. And then, you go and do something like *this*.


--- Aphrodite Rejection 14 ---
Aphrodite: You think you can brush me aside like that? Well, I think I can crush you into tiny, little bits! Let's see who's right, shall we?


--- Aphrodite Make Up 01 ---
Aphrodite: Let's say we kissed and made up, dearest. Just, do not anger me again, or I might come down and kill you there myself!


--- Aphrodite Make Up 02 ---
Aphrodite: Alas that passion sometimes drives me into vengeance, dearest! Yet, who among us isn't without vices, *hm*?


--- Aphrodite Make Up 03 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, how I hate to fight with you like this! Let's forgive each other and forget, go back to how things used to be?


--- Aphrodite Make Up 04 ---
Aphrodite: I'm not angry with you any longer, dearest! Though, might I suggest you take some extra steps to keep it that way, hm?


--- Aphrodite Make Up 05 ---
Aphrodite: A loving heart is a forgiving heart, don't you agree? So I shall let this little matter slide, and you've my loving heart to thank for it, *hm-hm*!


--- Aphrodite Make Up 06 ---
Aphrodite: The truth is I'm a lover, not a fighter, dearest. So how about we call this matter put to bed, and get on with our lives?


--- Aphrodite Make Up 07 ---
Aphrodite: I'd say this little squabble can be put to bed, for now. I'm better for the moment, but I was very angry with you, love!


--- Aphrodite Make Up 08 ---
Aphrodite: I cannot bring myself to stay upset with you forever, little godling, so let's move along from that small misunderstanding there.


--- Aphrodite Make Up 09 ---
Aphrodite: There is no common sense with love, godling, so... why don't we pretend your indiscretion there did not occur.


--- Aphrodite Make Up 10 ---
Aphrodite: It is through times of difficulty that the love we share is tested and reforged. But you just watch yourself when testing it like that.


--- Aphrodite Make Up 11 ---
Aphrodite: Love and jealousy go hand in hand, don't they, dearest? Although the former's much more pleasant, isn't it.


--- Aphrodite Make Up 12 ---
Aphrodite: Oh, all this fighting! It's just not like us at *all*, dearest! Let's say we kissed and then made up, all right?


--- Aphrodite Gift 01 ---
Zagreus: Lady Aphrodite, I am truly blessed simply to have made your acquaintance, so, this is for you.
Aphrodite: Lasting relationships are built on reciprocity. So if you lavish me with gifts, why, what am I to do but give you something in return?


--- Aphrodite Gift 02 ---
Zagreus: My lady Aphrodite, if not for our acquaintance, I am certain that my days or nights would be much drearier indeed.
Aphrodite: Why, dearest, such a wonderfully thoughtful gift, for me? I love it, and I would be lying if I said you shouldn't have!


--- Aphrodite Gift 03 ---
Zagreus: Lady Aphrodite, I'm afraid there really isn't much here worthy of you, but perhaps this can suffice.
Aphrodite: My, but if this isn't such a treasure to behold, and I accept it as a sign of your affection! Of something even more, perhaps...?


--- Aphrodite Gift 04 ---
Zagreus: Dear Aphrodite, surely you have all the offerings you can stand, but I would ask that you accept one more.
Aphrodite: Ah, dearest, but it stirs my heart to know you care so deeply for our wonderful relationship! To celebrate it with such princely gifts!


--- Aphrodite Gift 05 ---
Zagreus: Dear Aphrodite, the incomparable beauty of Olympus is less difficult to fathom, having already met you. I am so grateful to have earned your favor.
Aphrodite: My, but don't *you *come on rather strong, there, little godling! Though, I can take much more of your affections, you shall see!


--- Aphrodite Gift 06 ---
Zagreus: Aphrodite, you must have more worshipers and suitors than all your kin upon Olympus combined. I may not fall exactly into either category, though I hope you know my gratitude for all you've done for me is true.
Aphrodite: You know, dearest, I am more worshiped than perhaps anybody else upon Olympus! You'd think getting such praise would roll right off my back by now, but no! I love receiving it. Especially from you.


--- Aphrodite Gift 07 ---
Zagreus: My lady Aphrodite, once more you've graced me with your presence and your favor, which inspire the best from me. Let this modest gift of Ambrosia signify I'm forever in your debt.
Aphrodite: My little godling. I'd say you've honored me more times than I could count, but that would be a lie, now, wouldn't it. I so admire your devotion and your perseverance! If ever you do reach us on Olympus, I should very much enjoy getting to know you even better, then.


--- Duo - Dionysus and Aphrodite (1) ---
Dionysus: Look, Zag, you should know by now that when it comes to feasting, it's Yours Truly here who puts on the best performance. But I do have Lady Aphrodite's help!
Aphrodite: Wine does have a rather special way of making everybody look even more beautiful than ever, Dionysus dear! And from such beauty, why, long-lasting love is born! And also shorter-lasting love, much of the time.


--- Duo - Athena and Aphrodite (1) ---
Athena: Your predicament has pulled our family together, united in a desire to assist you, Cousin. Even those who typically do not think much of those other than themselves.
Aphrodite: Oh, if only I had wisdom such as yours, Athena dear, so that I was more capable of picking up on subtle jabs and insults such as that! You're not fooling anybody with your feigned benevolence, you know.
Athena: The world is not all lies and deceit as you make it out to be, Aphrodite. Sometimes, a lending of assistance is no more than it appears to be. Now either back up Zagreus, or stand aside.


--- Duo - Demeter and Aphrodite (1) ---
Demeter: Remember something for us, Zagreus. A frozen heart holds no sway over anyone at all. Isn't that right, oh Aphrodite, dear?
Aphrodite: Oh, I don't know, my dearest Demeter! The frozen heart has tendency to thaw, and then begin to beat with renewed vigor after that. I trust your time shall come! It can never be too late, except for mortals, the poor things.
