! colspan="2" |Achilles First Meeting Alt
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Good to see you, lad. You've been awful busy as of late, there, haven't you? Let me know if there's something I can do, though from what I can tell, you've had a pretty good handle on it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Grants Codex
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You'll get the hang of it out there, lad. For all our sparring practice, there's no teacher like the real thing. Now then, I have something for you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, wait, you're giving me your Codex? I can't accept something like this!"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Please, I insist. I want your love of history to grow, not just your love of warfare. Besides, maybe you can finish out the rest of it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Lounge Closed 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, is it really true that Cerberus ripped the lounge up right after I left? He must have gotten in a lot of trouble."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I only wish you could have seen it, lad. The place looked like a vineyard after a typhoon! Your lord father was livid. But he never gets so angry with the dog. Poor Dusa, though, she's picking the place up."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, no... I wondered what became of Dusa. She's always worried Father's going to fire her, even without something like this."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Ghost Admin Progress 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I have to say, lad! This place is livelier than usual, of late. Some of the old fixtures of the House getting patched up, new furnishings... it's rather nice, really. We've you to thank, don't we."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, that? It's nothing. Though I'm glad it's made a difference for the better. Our contractor's been doing all the work, I'm just putting in the orders."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"And the funds. Your father runs the Underworld a certain way. This old House is lavish, I suppose, but he has long since ceased trying to make it livable, at all. So the changes are appreciated."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Misc Meeting 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Keep at it, lad. I've known great men throughout my life, and I can always tell when someone's better than their circumstances. Fight like I'd fight out there."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I'll give them hell as you once did, Achilles. Though, doubtless many of the shades who stand against me first arrived in Tartarus because of you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Misc Meeting 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Happen to know whom I should thank for the weapons just outside my chambers, Achilles?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I'm sure I wouldn't, lad. Though if I happen to run into them, I'll let them know."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Misc Meeting 03
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Your enemy is not the wretched dead, and not your father, lad. It is the Underworld, itself. It has been fashioned to prevent escape. You must have seen, by now, how all the chambers seem to rearrange themselves."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"The Underworld itself, my enemy... I'll do my best anticipating its surprises, sir."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Misc Meeting 04
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"The sealed weapons by your chambers; your father won't observe their absence, I don't think. They remind him of a time he stood together with his brothers and sisters. He wants nothing more to do with any of that. I think it's fitting you've inherited their power."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"A power that once sealed away the Titans... maybe it's a power that can break me out of here. Thank you for helping me, Achilles."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Fist Weapon 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I got acquainted with the Twin Fists of Malphon recently, sir. Fills me with a kind of battle-hunger I'd not felt before. To think the empty hand could have as much destructive force as any weapon."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"The empty hand has more destructive force than any weapon, lad. It is the only weapon that can wield all others. And without it, all others are nearly powerless. The Twin Fists are a testament to that. Use them with care. Don't lose your head out there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Gun Weapon 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I found another weapon waiting for me in the courtyard, Achilles. ''Exagryph''. I never entirely believed it was real."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Between us, lad... I wish it wasn't. Were such a thing available to my enemies during my fighting days, I surely would have come here even sooner. But I trust you have the training to use it well. May it serve you as it served the fire goddess Hestia... she hasn't needed it in a while."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Quest Log 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I have to say, lad? Authorizing transfer of the Fated List from the old archives, straight into your chambers... bold of you! And right beneath your father's nose, at that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, that? Just another job from the House Contractor near as I'm concerned, sir. Not like anything on the list was getting done while it was stuck in the archives, besides!"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, that's the spirit, I suppose. If there's one thing I know, it's that the Three Fates always get their way; but if you wish to help them go about it, then perhaps they'll pay you back in kind."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Boon List 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Thought I'd put in a House Contractor order to keep that Codex of yours sorted, lad. Now that you know so many on Olympus, figured it must be a lot keeping track of all their blessings and such."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yes, that should definitely come in handy, sir! I'm still getting a handle on everything I can do, with all the Olympians' powers fused with mine."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Super Lock Keys 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir? I got a relic of some sort out there... a globule of ancient blood, which formed after I fought with Megaera. Is this really the Titans' blood I found?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"As far as I know, yes, lad. That it is. Though whose, exactly, I'm not so sure. You'd best hang onto it, and keep it safe. Your weapons... they shall thirst for it and drink it up. Not yet, perhaps, but soon."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Super Gift Points 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, look at what I got out there, Achilles sir! A vintage bottle of Ambrosia, plucked straight from Elysium! I hear this stuff is very good, but... can't even open it. I've no idea what to do with it, right now."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"The drink of the gods! I hear it's good, all right. But only for recipients with whom you're close. Perhaps hang onto it until it's ripe for use? Somebody would be grateful I am sure. Or it could fetch you something from the Wretched Broker over there."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Onions 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir, I have a very important question... why do you detest onions so much? Have they wronged you, somehow?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"As soon as you slice into one of those things... it makes you cry. Don't you find that a bit unsettling, lad? I won't shed tears over a cut-up vegetable."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, apparently they're pretty tasty if you don't eat them raw."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Post Flashback 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Your extended family, the Olympians... they wish to help you from this place, don't they? I just hope that their intentions are as pure as they appear. They don't get on well with your father."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Neither do I, last time I checked. I'll take all the help I can get trying to break out of here."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I'm pleased to hear you say that. I have known too many far too proud to accept help, even when it was sorely needed. You just be careful, lad."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Flashback 02
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Talk later. Best not keep your father waiting."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Megaera Relationship 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, you know, just... the usual struggles of battling toward the surface, generally to some ignoble death, though... wait, you mean between myself and Megaera, don't you."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I think she likes you more than she lets on. You have a certain way, besides. I know you two got off to a rough start. And circumstances lately haven't helped. But, if you love her... follow your heart."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And, what if I don't...? I hesitate to even use the word."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"If you don't... then cease with giving her such lavish gifts, I ought to think! No need to send the wrong impression, and there is nothing to be gained from such an empty gesture, anyhow."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Thanatos Relationship 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, you know, just... the usual struggles of battling toward the surface, generally to some ignoble death, though... wait, you mean between myself and Thanatos, don't you."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I think he cares for you more deeply than you know. You have a certain way, besides. It has been difficult between you two. And circumstances lately haven't helped. But, if you love him... follow your heart."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Whoa, just a moment, there, I mean... I've never said something like that, have I?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You haven't, no. And it is not my business to presume too much. Nevertheless, if your friendship with Thanatos is bounded... then, I would suggest you cease with giving him more lavish gifts. No need to send the wrong impression, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Meg And Than Relationship 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, you know, just... the usual struggles of battling toward the surface, generally to some ignoble death, though... wait, you mean between me, Meg, and Thanatos, don't you."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"If I may presume a bit, I gather that they share by now the feelings that you have for each of them; each in their respective way, of course. If you love them... one, the other, perhaps both? I mean, you're gods...! Follow your heart."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Whoa'', just a moment, there, I mean... ugh, I suppose you're not presuming much at all. Follow my heart, though? Where?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Wherever it should lead; that's how it works. Yours to decide when you've gone as far as you ought, and cease with the lavish gifts. No need to send the wrong impression, and there's nothing to be gained from such an empty gesture, anyhow, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Multiple Relationships 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I think I see that look again, if I am not mistaken in it, lad. What's on your mind? If you would like to share, I'm listening."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Oh'', it's just... sometimes, I find my thoughts, they wander between those I care about, it's... not just one. You mortals, typically you had a single suitor, did you not...?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"So we often told each other, yes. But... you're not like us mortals, or us shades. Nor are most of the others here. You gods... I cannot think of even one who had a single mate. Although, your father... maybe he is one."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wait, you're saying Father, he was never with somebody else besides... my mother?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, I of course don't know so very much about him, lad. But that's the way of it, from what I've learned. You needn't follow in his footsteps, though; I think you know that well enough by now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Being Close With Megaera 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Meant to tell you. Recently, I noticed Megaera, and... I believe I saw the faintest smile play across her lips. That anything to do with you, perhaps? Not asking for specifics, mind."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You really think that has to do with me...? I mean, I hope you're right, and I suppose it's possible, it's just... how can you tell?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Perhaps with time, I've grown keen to more than just the weaknesses of my enemies on the battlefield. Especially since I don't have those anymore. I'm happy for you, lad. The two of you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Being Close With Thanatos 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I have to tell you something, lad. When Thanatos returned to seek you out, I was very concerned. Not just for you, either. But you've since patched things up...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I think so. I hope so. It was complicated for a while there, but... I think things are clearer for us, now. Not just in the moment, but in retrospect. ''Ugh'', I'm not making any sense."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, on the contrary. I think I know exactly what you mean. I don't know Thanatos particularly well. Wasn't he who brought me here, you see. And he was always very busy, like your father. But, he always struck me as a decent sort."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Fury Sisters 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I ran into Meg's sisters out there. We didn't really hit it off. Meg said they're not permitted in the House. Not that I'm complaining, but... what's that about?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"They have not earned the right, lad. Nor expressed any desire to exist here with the rest of us. Your father has assigned them to specific roles that suit their dispositions. They're... not as sensible as Megaera, in my experience."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's what I was afraid of. Although, fear is for the weak."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Thanatos 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You saw that Thanatos is back, didn't you, lad? He's been over there brooding, when he's around, at least."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I saw, Achilles. I think he's angry with me because of my decision to leave the House. Not that it's any of his business."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, don't say that. It isn't everyday or night when one discovers that his closest friend has had it with his temperamental father, and decided to leave home. I think he's struggling with what to make of it. Be gentle with him, will you?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Zagreus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Achilles, I... uncovered a late passage in the Codex, with regard to Thanatos and me. It says, ''you ''say, you think that I'm the god of ''blood''? I'm not the god of anything, I think..."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, nonsense, lad! If you're a god, then you're the god of ''something'', I'm sure. It's just an observation, and I genuinely hope it's no offense. But, see... your father, and your mother, and your bloodstones, and your disposition..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Skelly 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I've been meaning to ask you about the odd skeleton usually standing around in the courtyard. Old acquaintance of yours? A hireling, perhaps?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"That one, Skelly, was it? We only met when all this business of escape began. If I have a connection to him, I am unaware. Does he claim to know me? Perhaps I slew him when we were alive."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I don't know that that's it. So neither of us has any idea where he's from or how he got there, huh. Can you think of any leads? Nyx doesn't seem to know him, either."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Perhaps the gods of Olympus sent him to your aid? Their methods can be odd. And, there are many who support you. Regardless, he does not appear to be your father's spy, if that is your concern."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Skelly 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Remember that Skelly character out in the courtyard, sir? Turns out he's been working with Charon all this time. Working for him more like! I had so much help in this, from all of you."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Charon! Of course. He has a stake in all that goes on in the Underworld. And he probably thinks highly of you. This Skelly character, though... he must have been somebody if Charon's confided in him."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"He won't tell me. He was either a venerable sea captain, or a petty thief. Maybe both?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Nyx 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"In my recent audience with Nyx, lad, she let on that you have mentioned Chaos as of late. Is it true you've met her parent, yourself?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I have. Chaos is... not like anyone I've ever met. At first I was a little worried, meeting this vast primordial entity apparently responsible for all creation, but... they seem all right. Chaos and Nyx haven't been talking for a while, though. You don't know what happened there, do you?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I know a little bit, I think. Nyx, she and Chaos, they just... slowly drifted apart. No animosity, not anymore, at least. It happens between parents and children. And once such ties are severed, they cannot always be restored. Especially among primordial gods as old as time, I suppose."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Nyx 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wanted to ask you more about Nyx and Chaos, sir. So they just drifted apart, I mean... why not just keep in touch? I don't understand. How hard is it just to say hello from time to time?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"It can be harder than you know. For someone like Nyx... she was responsible for no small part of creation, herself. As her relationship with Chaos grew more strained, she gave birth to Strife, Misery, Doom... sons and daughters you don't hear about too much."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, really? I've never heard Hypnos or Thanatos mention any of them, let alone Nyx. They sound like a handful. Where are they, what happened?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I don't know, lad. On the surface, I suppose? My point is, Nyx had her own problems to contend with. Dealing with her brood, governing the Underworld all on her own before your father arrived. Her relationship with Chaos suffered for it."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Nyx Chaos Reunion Quest 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Lad, I heard from Nyx! She said that she was able recently to reestablish contact with Chaos, thanks to you? You're just full of surprises, reforging old bonds between primordial gods like it was nothing."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, just took a bit of tampering with the Sigil in the admin chamber. Whole bunch of Darkness, too. But I could tell that Nyx and Chaos, they... seemed to really miss each other, to the extent they are able to miss anybody."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I think they're plenty capable of missing their loved ones, lad. The amount of time that either of us have existed... it's nothing compared to either of them. Imagine, being apart from someone you care about, for that long..."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Theseus Extreme Measures 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir? You happen to know whether Father authorized the transfer of a Macedonian Tau-Lambda chariot to Elysium in recent memory? I ran into the former hero Theseus, all joyriding about in one of those."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I know the chariot you mean. It's not just any Macedonian. It's modified, apparently by Daedalus, himself. No earthly weapons can do what it does. Though, please don't tell me Theseus put on that mask...?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you mean the golden matching mask? I saw him wearing it, all right. Looked like a proper fool, I thought. What of it, though?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Hahah'', well! I think that Daedalus would certainly agree. Heard that he fashioned that mask and outfit as a little joke. For someone deeply prideful, and well unaware. It must have suited Theseus quite well, then, yes?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Weapon Enchantments 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, wanted to ask you more about the weapons I've been using. They can change shape! So, they've molded themselves to suit me, and remember their past wielders, something like that?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Something like that. They seem alive, don't they? Taking everything in. I think they long predate even your father's time. Some have seen many different owners. Chances are, you shall not be the last."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"As you may know, lad, I've a connection to the weapons that you use, having once wielded one of them myself. Of course not knowing its significance back then, but I digress. Sometimes, it... well, it keeps in touch. And I've a vision from it to impart."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"What, you mean a vision from Varatha the Eternal Spear? That's... out of the ordinary, and also a bit concerning. So, what did you see?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well... I saw a great, bearded warrior. Bigger than me, pitch-black hair. Bearing an aspect of Varatha unlike any with which I'm familiar. Then he was gone. But, what still lingered were these words: ''I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix''."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix''... I don't understand. What's that supposed to mean?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"There's one more thing. This was not my first such vision. Long ago... I saw one of Varatha's other bearers. It was ''you''. Your Infernal Arms... they must be weapons of the Fates' design. They know already who shall brandish them. Now they ask a favor. Seek Varatha. Speak the words. Go."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Reveals Guan Yu Aspect 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles...! Something awakened in Varatha when I spoke the words. It revealed to me a form I'd never seen. Wielded by the warrior called Guan Yu. Handsomely dressed! And just as you described. That's no Greek name, is it..."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"No, I don't think so, lad. I don't know who this Guan Yu is, or where he's from. Or even ''when ''he's from. But the Fates must have a plan for him, and you. Anyway... I think my part in this is ended. Varatha's served you well, no? I trusted it in life; I trust it now. Fear is for the weak."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Arthur Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir! I've uncovered the hidden aspect for Stygius! Nyx gave me the words this time, and a vision of a noble leader among mortals. An entire armored legion of them! Arthur was his name. ''Will be ''his name, I guess."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"A future leader among men, wielding that blade? The mysteries of the Infernal Arms run deep, don't they. Although it seems that you and Stygius formed quite a bond."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Rama Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Heart-Seeker. Lady Artemis herself told me the words, and... it seems Coronacht belonged to, maybe ''will ''belong to somebody called Rama. Peerless with the bow. Even among gods..."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Many lay claim to peerlessness with bows in my experience, there, lad, although... I'm not to judge a vision from an ancient weapon such as that. I hope this Rama shall use his weapon wisely when the time comes; same as you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Beowulf Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, sir, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Shield of Chaos... thanks to Chaos, themself. Apparently someday it'll protect an armored warrior known as Beowulf from all sorts of dangers... even a dragon! Mortals don't stand much of a chance against those, do they?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Depends upon the dragon, I suppose. I've heard they differ all across the world. Though, that's a fascinating find, there, lad. This Beowulf... sounds like he'll find a way to make good use of all that protective gear. Always preferred mobility, myself, but then, to each his own."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Gilgamesh Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"The Bull of Minos led me to another hidden aspect, Achilles! A beastly form of the Twin Fists, belonging to an ancient god-king known as Gilgamesh. You ever hear that name? He had a half-beast friend, apparently. Like how Asterius is friend to Theseus."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Gilgamesh, you said...? That name isn't familiar to me, but... with these hidden aspects, there's bound to be a connection to the future, or the past. Say, why is the Bull of Minos aiding you? I thought he was one of your rivals barring passage from Elysium."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, he is. He's loyal through and through to Theseus, and never holds back when we fight. But he seems to be the respect-for-his-opponent type. Unlike his companion."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Lucifer Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I discovered the hidden aspect of the Adamant Rail, after Lord Zeus himself told me the waking-phrase. It's from a winged fellow by the name of Lucifer... apparently had a bit of a falling out with his lord father. Wonder how that worked out for him."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Huh''! Perhaps it's from a time even before the Olympians rebelled against the Titans. But I've never heard of any Lucifer, with or without wings. Suggests to me, perhaps that falling out of his did not work out so well."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Legendary Aspects 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, something I've been wondering... now that I've discovered all the hidden aspects of my weapons... as far as I know, anyway... I can't see any pattern there, at all. Guan Yu, Gilgamesh, Rama, and so on... any idea why them?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"To know for certain, I suppose you'd have to ask the Fates, themselves... and get an answer from them, too. I ask myself how come you found an aspect of mine, among them all. What made me so special, do you suppose?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You were a great warrior! Famous, in your time! It's no surprise to me at all the Fates chose you to have a stint with one of their world-altering weapons."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, that's just it! I was quite famous, yes. Infamous, perhaps, but no matter. Perhaps it's just that these weapons demand to make themselves known, above all. To leave a lasting impression in the hands of their wielders."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You think the Infernal Arms just want to be ''popular''? Have exciting stories told about them and whatnot?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Achilles Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I've had the opportunity to use your aspect of Varatha, sir. So, you once wielded it yourself? It... fills me with a hunger for battle even more so than usual. A bit of your fighting spirit, perhaps."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Be very wary of that spirit, lad. It was what brought me here before my time. Although that spear indeed once served me well. A parting gift from my old master Chiron. He cautioned me as I am cautioning you. Though, may you be a better listener."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Chiron Aspect 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I meant to ask, did you know that Coronacht the Heart-Seeker once belonged to the centaur, Chiron? Because one of its aspects is his own. He didn't have it back when you trained with him, did he...?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Master Chiron, truly...? Ah, of course. He granted me a spear, I think you know. If he possessed one such weapon, why not more? I remember his bow shined like the sun. It was splendid, and never missed its mark... though I attributed that to Chiron's extraordinary skill."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Mirror 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I have to thank you for the mirror back there, lad. Lets me get a better look at things out in the great hall every now and then."

|"Of course, sir, don't mention it. You're really stuck having to guard this corridor most of the time, huh?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh certainly, it's an important corridor! Think of it, if just any shade could pass through either of those doors back there. Your father's barely keeping it together, as it is."

! colspan="2" |Achilles About Warrior Statue 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Quite a statue you commissioned over there. I suppose I can think of worse subjects than mighty Heracles for me to have to stand about and stare at."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"They say he was the strongest demigod who ever lived. Though, I bet you could take him, sir. Big guy like that, you'd be too quick, I'm sure. You ever meet him?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Only in passing. He once died a mortal's death... worse than mine. Had a brief stint down here, but... he's favored by Olympus. Got a special arrangement of some sort, I heard. Haven't seen him since."

|"Achilles, looks like I could buy back my right to go in the administrative chamber, there. I never want to go in there again, but... can you think of any reason whatsoever that I should?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Hah'', well. Perhaps we all want what we cannot have. Other than that, I suppose certain documents or records in there could be of some benefit under the circumstances, right?"

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Yes, well... that was before I was reunited with Patroclus, and had the opportunity to help you in a pinch, with him at my side. I trust we were of some small service, then?"

|"Achilles, I... sometimes I fear that Father, if he learns that you've been aiding me, that he will... not be generous with you."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Don't worry about me, lad. Your father's still getting caught up with work that I created for him in my mortal days. Besides... there's nothing he can take from me. We have a mutual arrangement, he and I."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Vs Hades 02
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, I'm concerned that Father's growing angrier with you. He thinks you've taken sides against him in all this. I don't want anything to happen."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"He's right, lad. I have taken sides. But, as for you not wanting anything to happen... while I know what you meant, I don't want you to say such things again. Do you understand? You're doing this because something here ''needs ''to happen. Hold back your fear."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Vs Aphrodite 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Wanted to say, the Lady Aphrodite asked that I relay a message to you, sir. She said that she admires you. Mentioned a certain war."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Admires me, does she? Sometimes, lad, I think that Aphrodite is the mightiest of all the gods. Her power is what spurs us all to action. Whether to love, or war. Or sometimes both the two. I'm grateful for the message."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Vs Artemis 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Hey, Achilles! I heard from Lady Artemis out there. It seems you have a bit of a fan in her. She wanted me to tell you you're the best! She's not mistaken, by the way."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"The goddess of the hunt herself said that? That's very flattering to hear. Good thing she doesn't know I'm all washed up, by now. Her memory is of my glory days."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Daedalus 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, have you ever run across the shade of Daedalus in all your time? I've found some of his legendary hammers out there, but no sign of him."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I've never met him, no. Your father keeps him fully occupied with building out his Underworld, and renovating constantly. No wonder some of his old crafting-tools are strewn about. I take it you've been able to make use of them?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Gifting Gods 01
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, did you ever use to pray to the gods? Make offerings to them and such, back when you were alive?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Prayed mostly to my mother, lad. I always had my doubts the gods were listening. That they could even hear. Though, I suppose that if you make an offering, they might be so inclined, just for the moment, anyway. They helping much?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Demeter 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You have a worried look about you, lad. Spare me your thoughts?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, it's just... I met the goddess Demeter out there. The blessings that she offered, they... just drained the heat and life from everything. I thought she saw to fruits and grains and vegetables and such? Not that I'm complaining."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"All gods and goddesses are to be feared. Demeter, she has the power to give life, or take it. Seems she's more interested in the latter, though. She's the eldest on Olympus, and your father seems to harbor a particular dislike for her. I don't know why. Be careful."

! colspan="2" |Achilles About Dusa Firing 01 A
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Achilles, what happened between Nyx and Dusa? Dusa's really gone?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Nyx cut her off, lad. I'm sorry. I know you cared about her. I was as surprised as you when I found out. I knew that Nyx had her concerns about Dusa's propensity to overwork herself, but... this wasn't the step I was expecting."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Propensity to overwork herself... you really think that's what this was about? I can't shake the feeling it's my fault. Nyx didn't want her talking to me, as though she's beneath me or something! ''Ugh'', what am I going to do."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Look... I don't have all the information on this one, and neither do you from the sound of things. Nyx loves you and respects you. I trust she would want to know how this affects you."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Dusa Re Hiring 01
|-

|-
|'''Achilles'''

|"...No reason in particular. Just that it brings me joy to hear of your progress."
|-

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I haven't seen you in a while, lad. You made it to Elysium last time, didn't you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I did, Achilles. It's crawling with great warriors still looking for a fight. It's not exactly what I was expecting."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Your father's marshalled the most willing ones to deal with you. Doubtless there's much at stake in it for them, if but the pride of having done the task. Although I think that pride will always be their weakness."
|-

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I couldn't help but notice, lad, that Cerberus has been away for quite some time. Turns out your father's put him back to work above. I truly hope you shall not have to come to blows."
|-

|"Don't worry, sir. I've run into Cerberus up top, all right. Even if he's technically Father's pet, he'd never bare his fangs at me. No matter how much Father might wish otherwise."

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Oh, it's just... I've never slain a living creature, sir. Until my recent journey to the Temple up above. I know they're just Satyrs and vermin, but... it's not the same as sending wretches to the depths."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Look. All mortal life is fragile; it simply is a struggle to survive. Sooner or later it fails to succeed, and then, it ends up here. And we have room enough for everyone, even the Satyrs and the vermin of the world."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Now that you mention it, I have to say I'm glad we can accommodate all former-living things. And at least mortals get to rest assured knowing what happens once they die! Must really ease the mind."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, at least I know who will be waiting for me the next time I climb all the way to the Temple of Styx and manage my way out."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Don't lose heart, lad. I did not train your father, only you. He is a god; but he is just a god. If you'll forgive my bit of treason there."

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"You really made it all the way? You must have... gotten past your father, that's amazing, lad. But, wait, what was she like, what happened to you there?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She was... she was great! Nothing like Father, more like... ''you'', a little bit, I guess! Though, being on the surface, it just seemed to suck the life right out of me. Even without the wretches of the Underworld trying to do me in."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"But then, you had a little time at least! Sounds like you have unfinished business with her, there. You got to her this once... surely you're able to again, isn't that right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Persephone Meeting 02
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"How did it go, lad? You've been gone a while. For good reason, I hope?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I found her, again, sir, and... we were able to talk some more. But, I have so many questions left for her, and Father's certainly not been of any help..."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, first of all, good work. I knew you had it in you. Secondly... you know what you have to do. Go find her, for as many chances as it takes. It's not just her you've sought... it's the answers to those questions that you have."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles About Persephone Meeting 03
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"So, you can tell me in due time if you decide to, lad. But I do have a question, same as you did, going into this. Why did she leave? Why did she leave ''you'', in particular?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"It's that she didn't even know I was alive. Sounds as though Nyx revived me sometime after I was born, but by that point... Mother had already left, and... they let her be. For reasons I am trying to find out."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Ah, that's... quite a bit to take in, there. And it explains more than a bit, I think. Look, I'm not one to speculate too much. I trust you'll find the answers that you seek as you proceed."

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Just take it easy, now. You got there once, there isn't any question in my mind that you can do it once again. Your father's acting as though nothing's changed, besides. So, don't lose hope. You're capable of this."
|-

|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I wouldn't know of what you mean, there, lad. For there are certain subjects so forbidden here right now that not even rumors can take hold. But, just between us for the time: Congratulations. Truly."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Thank you, sir. I didn't know whether I had it in me. As for the other bit, I'll keep it quiet, then, for now. I probably shouldn't be tying my sense of self-worth to praise from friends, acquaintances, and strangers, anyway."
|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"That's so, indeed, sir. Especially for now, at least, I'm going to keep on fighting to the surface. Helps me to vent a bit, and, like Hypnos says, it makes the Underworld a better place! Though indirectly, I suppose."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Well, then, I look forward to working with you in a more formal capacity. And, it is my sincerest hope that you, your mother, and your father learn to get on better with each other, now."

! colspan="2" |Achilles Post Epilogue 01
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"So, lad, tell me, then. How went the family feast, was everything all right?"
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Well, I confess I was perhaps a little nervous for practically the entire thing, but... all in all, I had a good time, and I'm very, very glad it all turned out the way it did. How about yourself?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I quite enjoyed it, too. Last time I was invited to a feast, I was still busy warring on the surface, that's how long it's been. I must say, your mother is quite good with words! Had everybody chatting, laughing..."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"She really pulled it off! But... for all her confidence, I don't think she knew she had it in her. Because if she did... if she reached out to Olympus sooner... a lot of things could have been different."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Don't dwell on that. I spoke a bit with Nyx. Your mother had her reasons. No one gets to act on perfect information, right? All we have is what we think we know, and what our conscience tells us. Your mother got to where all this was possible... all thanks to you."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"All thanks to me, sir? I had ample help along the way. For instance, I could not have done it without ''you''. Would have been using an old chair leg as a weapon, I suppose."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"And what a fearsome chair leg it would be! In any case... you heading out there, soon? Olympus should be more than happy to assist in your security review. If that's what we're calling it now."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Yeah, I should go. I'll see you not too long from now."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Post Epilogue 02
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I'm so impressed with what you've managed to accomplish, lad. When I was closer to your age... or, the age you appear to be... all I wanted was glory. To be remembered forever. Look where that got me! I'm glad you know better than I did."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"So in pursuing glory... you think you lost it? Forgive me, here, but I just disagree. I settled a family squabble. You single-handedly turned an entire war!"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"A foolish war. Glory comes to those driven to excel in worthwhile pursuits. A happy side effect, not a goal unto itself. Though, you don't need for me to tell you that."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"If not for all your training and advice, I wouldn't have come this far. You prepared me for this. Wasn't that a worthwhile pursuit? Must mean you got some glory after all, then, right?"
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Codex Progress 01

|-

|"I'll try to travel for the both of us, Achilles. I've seen so little other than these walls."
|-
! colspan="2" |Achilles Codex Progress 02
|-

|"Well, look at you, lad, with that Codex brimming with our history! I knew I could rely on you to fill it out. Back when I was alive, why, no one would have ever believed what goes on down here."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Mortals must have had their stories, though. About what happens to them once they die, and once they end up in this place."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"They have their stories, definitely so. They fear your father, understandably. They also fear your dog. But most of them know precious little else. Even their fears, I think, are born of ignorance. As most fears tend to be."
|-

|-

|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"''Erm'', Achilles sir, there's something I've been wondering, about your Codex. The words are yours, and yet it's through my actions that I'm able to absorb them. Is that how mortal scriptures always work?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"''Ah''. You have to understand, lad, I've been here in your father's realm for quite some time. My documented learnings became bound to me, much like this spear, you see? You can undo those bindings over time. Thus my knowledge can be yours. Whatever it amounts to."

|"I understand. What can I do about this, sir? There must be something. But, you have to let me know what's going on."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Simply put, he is the reason that I'm here. Patroclus lost his life before I did. Because of me. I shortly followed, in a rage. When I arrived here, I received a hero's welcome. Your father himself ushered me to Elysium. But that's not what I wanted."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"You wanted to see Patroclus. But, he's in Elysium, while you... oh, no."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I signed a pact, lad. Felt that the terms were good enough. He could live there, while I'd live here, at least for now. Such deals are most uncommon, and their confidentiality must be upheld. But, let's speak no more of this for now, all right? Some other time."
|-

|"There has to be a way for me to make this right. Not just for him, for you."
|-

|"No, lad. I was that sort, I think, but he was not. He was... one of the only men I knew who did not look upon me as a threat. He saw something in me I never knew was there. And in turn, with him, I felt... how to describe it? Calm. Whole."
|-

|"''Hah''! I'm restless all the time. I can only imagine."

|-

|"Until he died. I did refuse to fight, until he died, but at that point... ''ungh'', look, lad, if we're going to discuss these matters, best we do so in the lounge, not here."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...The fool of a king I served... I'd never take up arms, for him. But, Patroclus, he always had a different way of looking at things. As I refused to fight, he rose to the occasion. Took up my armor, led my brothers into battle, in my guise. Fought nobly... but then, he... well."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"And after you found out... you sought vengeance for him. Took vengeance."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"That I did. They got me, finally, of course. But, not before I broke them, first. The war soon ended, after that. It is an awful contradiction, that to quickly end war, one need only extinguish many lives at once. I had not realized it at the time."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Did you... allow yourself to die? So that you could see Patroclus again, here?"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"...I don't know. Maybe. I only know that I was filled with rage. Rage that subsided, soon after I arrived here. I felt... empty. I never saw Patroclus again. But, I learned my brothers honored my last request, as my ashes were laid to rest with his. ''<Sigh> ''Anyway...! Appreciate the drink."

|"Achilles, I... I'm sorry, I... just told him about your ashes being intermingled, that whole thing? And about the pact. You told me once to send him your love and regards! This brought him no joy, only questions! You told me not to speak to Father, not to him!"
|-

|"''<Sigh>''...You're right, I... should have specified. Or shouldn't have. Because what you said, probably is for the best. I didn't mean to lose my temper with you, lad, it's just... look, thank you for looking out for him. For both of us. Just, please be careful."

|"''Oh'', I don't know. I felt I had no choice, either, except to serve this House. At least at first. But in training the Prince... preparing him... I felt like I was living for something again. As strange as that may sound."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"Nevertheless, given the circumstances of your life and servitude, you need not have given so much of yourself. The greatness of your mortal days followed you into death."

|"...I cannot ever repay you for what you have done, O Night. Know only that it is my honor to continue to serve at your pleasure, here."
|-
|'''Nyx'''
|"I am certain I know nothing of what you mean, Achilles. Though, your continued service here is more than welcome. The honor is mine."

|'''Orpheus'''
|"...You're much too modest, Lord Achilles, for someone with such a number of heroic deeds and glorious decapitations to his name! You ought to be more like ever-boastful Zagreus, and talk it up some more!"
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"Oh, fear not, Orpheus, I was quite boastful in my day. And would you look at where it got me? Besides, I've not the imagination to come up with tales as tall as those of our Prince Zagreus."

|"...Do you miss it, yourself, Lord Achilles, sir? The freshness of the air. The need to have meals several times a day, and such."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I scarce remember it, my friend. Although your songs do stir up memories, sometimes. I'm used to things the way they are, I think. But you, not so much?"
|-
|'''Orpheus'''
|"Oh, on the contrary, sir, I am profoundly satisfied. We are most fortunate to have employment even after death. Imagine, merely resting for eternity, when you could work!"

|'''Achilles'''
|"I thought we might run into you, but... how strange to see you face-to-face out here, lad. To see this place myself. I still can't quite believe any of this..."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"He really can't. Though I keep telling him, it's true. Nothing's accomplished without risk, isn't that so? But, we of course have you to thank, stranger. Our troubles needn't have been your concern."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"Nonsense, sir. You're my friend. And Achilles... I don't know where I would even be, if not for you."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"Well, no need to get emotional, is there? We myrmidons, we're not the sentimental type. Achilles is simply on break, is all. From a demanding job. You've a demanding job as well, so here! My customary gift."

|'''Patroclus'''
|"Well if it isn't the ward of Achilles, come to visit us. I don't know how I can ever repay you, stranger. I'm quite sure that it isn't possible."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I reached more or less the same conclusion, Pat."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"How about you just keep offering me those premium goods you have no interest in when I pass through, and we can call it even, sir?"
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"That I had plans to do, regardless, though... if you should think of something else at any point, please do let either of us know."

|'''Patroclus'''
|"Good, there you are, stranger. Settle something for us quickly, hm? Would Achilles not make for the perfect Champion of Elysium? For I think almost anybody would be better than the current one."
|-
|'''Achilles'''
|"I think I'd rather maintain watch over a nearly empty hall than battle all the shades around here, Pat."
|-
|'''Zagreus'''
|"I, too, would vastly prefer having to contend with Theseus rather than yourself, Achilles. Although, that's not to say I disagree that almost anybody would be better in the role than him."
|-
|'''Patroclus'''
|"It seems, then, I am overruled. But I know Champion material when I see it, and I see it now."
