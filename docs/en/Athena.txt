--- Zeus With Athena 01 ---
Zeus: Why, look, Zagreus, here comes brave Athena, first to reach you among all my kin, in all her shrewdness. So proactive, you contacted Zagreus prior to even telling me, my dear!
Athena: Lord Father, would that I could settle even more such matters quickly and discreetly, so that only the most vital of them rise up to the level of your notice, sir. Though, I'm certain Zagreus and I are very grateful you have intervened.


--- Ares With Athena 01 ---
Ares: I wished only to speak to you in private once again, my kin, except, you see...
Athena: ...Except you see, dear Cousin, that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable. I caution you around my half-brother, is all. Now carry on.
Ares: You interrupt me once again, dear sister. You know I do not care for that. I warn you to stay out of my affairs. I shall aid my kin as I see fit.
Athena: You only do as you see fit, Lord Ares. Mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all.


--- Aphrodite With Athena 01 ---
Aphrodite: You must forgive us, little godling, meaning our extended family here upon Olympus! Some of us are terribly stuck up, and must be making matters much more complicated than they have to be.
Athena: I wonder, dearest Aphrodite, whether you'd be willing to repeat such things directly to my countenance?
Aphrodite: Oh, you must know full well that I would do much more than that directly to your countenance, Athena dear! Quite frankly, you could use a lot of work!


--- Aphrodite With Athena 02 ---
Aphrodite: Dearest, you must know, Goddess Athena and myself, we don't always share a common view, perhaps because she overthinks things constantly, while my heart leads me on!
Athena: I'm glad we understand each other, then. It would be most embarrassing to be caught bickering amongst ourselves in front of Zagreus.


--- Dionysus With Athena 01 ---
Dionysus: Hey, Zag, when you arrive, it's going to be a real scene, I'll tell you now! Even Athena here will cut loose for a bit, let down her hair, you know, put on something more comfy, yeah, it's going to be *great*!
Athena: Perhaps Lord Dionysus here is the true god of strategy, as it appears he is uncannily aware of my next move, Cousin. Although, be that as it may, I shall attempt to remain focused on your situation. Not his feast.


--- Athena With Zeus 01 ---
Athena: Noble cousin, my lord father has taken keen interest in your journey and your plight, and now seeks to aid you with the thunder of heaven itself. And you've my support, as well, of course.
Zeus: I thank you for the generous introduction, fair Athena, and I always rest assured when you are close at hand. I trust with our combined might, our good Zagreus is virtually certain to succeed!


--- Athena With Poseidon 01 ---
Athena: When I first notified Lord Father Zeus and other members of our family of your existence, Zagreus, it was Uncle Poseidon here who first leapt up, and pledged his power over sea and earth to you. Is that not so, Uncle?
Poseidon: Exactly so, Athena! You, with that fine memory of yours! For it isn't everyday I learn my doleful brother Hades sired a fine son! He does not know how good he has it, there! And *you*, Nephew, could have it even better, *here*!


--- Athena With Aphrodite 01 ---
Athena: Your predicament has pulled our family together, united in a desire to assist you, Cousin. Even those who typically do not think much of those other than themselves.
Aphrodite: Oh, if only I had wisdom such as yours, Athena dear, so that I was more capable of picking up on subtle jabs and insults such as that! You're not fooling anybody with your feigned benevolence, you know.
Athena: The world is not all lies and deceit as you make it out to be, Aphrodite. Sometimes, a lending of assistance is no more than it appears to be. Now either back up Zagreus, or stand aside.


--- Athena With Artemis 01 ---
Athena: If you've a moment, Zagreus? One of my relatives has claimed that I usurp your time. So I invited her to contact you.
Artemis: Um, hello, Zagreus... Athena here is grandstanding or trying to prove a point, or something. I don't know. Anyway, nice talking to you.
Athena: Well, I suppose that's settled, then. I am afraid such interactions aren't uncommon here amongst my family; but what's a family without flaws?


--- Athena With Dionysus 01 ---
Athena: Some members of our family do not yet fully understand just how precarious your situation is, Cousin. My Lord Dionysus here, he goes about as though this is a festive matter of some sort!
Dionysus: Oh, come on, Athena girl, you really mean to tell me that discovering a long-lost relative isn't a cause for celebrating right away, I mean, you can't be telling me a thing like *that*? Because if Zag isn't a cause for feasting, I don't know what is!


--- Athena With Demeter 01 ---
Athena: I bring to you the Lady Demeter, Cousin. I've asked that she please rest assured knowing we have your matter well under control. Though, in her infinite compassion, she has taken up your cause, nevertheless!
Demeter: Oh, you needn't lavish me with your faint praise, Athena dear. In all your boundless intellect, I'd have expected you would know I see through your intentions, plain as day.


--- Athena About Demeter 01 ---
Athena: The biting cold surrounding you must mean the Goddess of Seasons decided to take an interest in your struggle, Zagreus? I did not count on Demeter being a part of this. Take heart, though use discretion around her.


--- Athena About Olympian Reunion Quest 01 ---
Zagreus: This is it, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lady Athena, I trust you'll quickly figure this one out.
Athena: Is this some kind of offering for me? No, hold a moment, this appears to be a message! Part of one. Then, can this mean...? I have to notify the others. I trust they also have received something from you, or shortly shall.


--- Athena Post Epilogue 01 ---
Athena: It was my privilege to have visited your father's House, and briefly had a chance to meet *you*, Zagreus. Nyx and your mother each are very shrewd; perhaps you've taken after both of them. As for your new responsibilities... exposing weak points in defenses is my specialty.


--- Athena About Zeus 01 ---
Athena: I understand you've been in contact with my father. Your uncle Zeus, I mean. He's taken interest in your plight; you should feel honored!


--- Athena About Poseidon 01 ---
Athena: You've met the master of the seas, Poseidon, haven't you? Our uncle's affable but quick to anger. Be on your guard with him, is my advice.


--- Athena About Aphrodite 01 ---
Athena: Cousin, you've met Aphrodite, no? She likes beguiling others with her charms; but her intentions with you I believe are pure. You'll find our strengths are complementary.


--- Athena About Ares 01 ---
Athena: My warlike brother Ares reached you, didn't he. I've always found his conduct quite disturbing. At least it seems he's helping you for now.


--- Athena About Artemis 01 ---
Athena: I'll tell you something, Cousin: If even Artemis is aiding you, it's proof your cause is just. She doesn't often take an interest in family affairs.


--- Athena About Dionysus 01 ---
Athena: Did Dionysus truly visit you before? He tends to seek out revelry, not conflict. I'm pleased to know he's making himself useful here.


--- Athena About Hermes 01 ---
Athena: You arrived sooner than anticipated, Cousin, and my estimations seldom are inaccurate. All for the best, of course. Perhaps you're simply faster than I thought.


--- Athena About Hades Keepsake 01 ---
Athena: Zagreus, perhaps it is a fancy of imagination, but it seems almost as though, this time, you bear the blessing of... your own father! If Lord Hades is assisting you in any way in this, then I shall hold out hope that your relationship yet has capacity to heal, to some extent at least.


--- Athena About Hades Keepsake 02 ---
Athena: So you've another blessing from Lord Hades, then. Zagreus, I'm under no delusion you and your father shall become the closest friends, from here. Neverthless, I do believe it's possible to move forward even such a relationship as yours. Believe me... I know.


--- Athena Post Gift Pickup 01 ---
Athena: I so look forward to our meeting face to face amongst the gods, dear Cousin. Olympus shall be merrier and wiser once you're here.


--- Athena Post Gift Pickup 02 ---
Athena: Hail and good tidings to you, noble Cousin. May you be swift and thorough vanquishing the dead who dare oppose you.


--- Athena Post Gift Pickup 03 ---
Athena: Remain relentless in your effort to escape, dear Cousin. In spite of all our differences, perseverance is a quality we all possess.


--- Athena Post Gift Pickup 04 ---
Athena: You can always count upon assistance from me, Zagreus. I always shall prioritize the needs of our family above everything else.


--- Athena Post Gift Pickup 05 ---
Athena: Let my voice be a glimmer in the darkness, noble Cousin; though, may the blessing I am about to provide be even more than that.


--- Athena Vs Olympians 01 ---
Athena: You've met your distant relatives by now. We don't all share the same demeanor, nor see eye to eye. Though, all of us, I think, wish you the best.


--- Athena Backstory 01 ---
Athena: The one called Nyx... she is your mother, as I understand? We Olympians rarely consort with the chthonic gods. Though Nyx herself reached out to me about your plight, and I was spurred to act.


--- Athena Backstory 02 ---
Athena: Please send the goddess Nyx my kind regards. That she supports you in your effort to escape her own domain suggests a selflessness I would not have expected.


--- Athena Backstory 03 ---
Athena: It's such a cruelty that your father hid the knowledge of your birth and life from us, my cousin. It's unacceptable.


--- Athena Backstory 04 ---
Athena: Your father Hades and my father Zeus have not communicated in some time, and Zeus refuses to explain. Something transpired between the two of them. Perhaps you know better than I.


--- Athena Backstory 05 ---
Athena: There's something that I've wished to tell you, Zagreus: There is no shame in your upbringing. Many of us on Olympus, we likewise were born and raised under the strangest circumstances. Someday I'll have to tell you about mine.


--- Athena Post Flashback 01 ---
Athena: You're nothing like your father, Zagreus. I mean that as a compliment. He cut himself off from the rest of us. Many times have we attempted peace, to no avail.


--- Athena Run Progress 01 ---
Athena: It comforts me to see how far you've come, Cousin. And I am confident that you shall make your way, eventually. I shall look forward to our conversations then.


--- Athena Run Progress 02 ---
Athena: You reached the flames of Asphodel, well done! You may have quite a distance still to go, but having crossed through Tartarus is no small step, Cousin.


--- Athena Run Progress 03 ---
Athena: I see you've made it all the way to hallowed Elysium, Cousin? A significant way toward the surface, and if you could get there the one time, surely you have what it takes to do it again, and overcome the dangers that await therein.


--- Athena Run Progress 04 ---
Athena: I understand you nearly reached the surface lately, Zagreus. My confidence remains unshaken that you shall get out of there, eventually. No matter what sorts of unknown horrors lie shrouded beyond the boundary there.


--- Athena Run Cleared 01 ---
Athena: Were you not close to having reached the surface lately, Cousin? Then, this can only mean some unforeseen impediment prevented your escape.


--- Athena Run Cleared 02 ---
Athena: There must be some unconquerable force or foe awaiting you, just at the border of your realm and ours. We cannot even see it through a shroud of darkness, there. I shall make certain that your family knows it may take considerable time to surpass... so fear not, for we are patient, here.


--- Athena Run Cleared 03 ---
Athena: Despite whatever difficulties you've encountered, dear Cousin, again and again, you have never yielded. I must admit, your strength of will is quite inspiring. For, even I have doubts, from time to time. It's all the clearer to me why the goddess Nyx spoke so highly of you.


--- Athena Post Epilogue 02 ---
Athena: It's fortunate your troubles with your mother were resolved. Persephone, I mean! To think I led all of my family to believe your mother was the goddess Nyx, instead. It seems I was an unwitting accomplice to a bit of a deception, there. But Nyx, I know she merely tried to help.


--- Athena About Keepsake 01 ---
Athena: You bear my Owl Pendant, noble Cousin! Wherever it should go, I faintly see its shimmer from afar. Even where you reside! For owls see in total darkness, after all.


--- Athena About Nyx 01 ---
Athena: I have grown closer than expected with the goddess Nyx in all of this, Cousin. It is quite evident to me how much she cares for you. I must admit I envy your relationship, sometimes. For I've made do without a mother's presence in my life.


--- Athena About Nyx 02 ---
Athena: Lord Ares has suggested he and goddess Nyx have grown much closer to each other, in all this. Nothing untoward, if you must know. Ares and I have often disagreed, about so many things, and yet we share a fondness for the Night herself, it seems.


--- Athena About Nyx 03 ---
Athena: Sometimes I think about the goddess Nyx, and how I long for her to be the mother that I never had, Cousin. Is it improper that I say such things to you? One would expect I would already have somebody on Olympus, yet... it often feels as though I am the mother, here.


--- Athena About Quest Log 01 ---
Athena: The goddess Nyx has indicated you possess a list of prophecies from the Three Fates. I've such a list upon Olympus, here! It seems to be connected to your own, as several prophecies already are fulfilled. Isn't it such an honor to urge Fate along?


--- Athena Low Health 05 ---
Athena: Oh, Zagreus... your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped. Nevertheless, always strive onward, while you still draw breath.


--- Athena Low Health 05 ---
Athena: Oh, Zagreus... your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped. Nevertheless, always strive onward, while you still draw breath.


--- Athena Max Relationship 01 ---
Athena: Supporting you through your ordeal, Cousin? It's reminiscent of the thrill of doing battle by the side of those whom I hold dear. I may be safe upon our mountaintop, though I am with you there, as well... for every well-earned victory, and bitter loss.


--- Athena Has Weapon 01 ---
Athena: You brandish the Eternal Spear we call Varatha...! So then it wasn't lost during the war. A magnificent weapon, in deserving hands.


--- Athena Has Weapon 02 ---
Athena: Why, you wield Coronacht the Heart-Seeker...! I never took you for an archer, though the power of that bow is undeniable. Use it wisely!


--- Athena Has Weapon 03 ---
Athena: You bear Aegis, the original itself...! My own shield was forged much later, in its image. You'll have to tell me someday how you found it.


--- Athena Has Weapon 04 ---
Athena: You got your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists, I see. No ordinary weapon. Prone to fits of savagery quite unbecoming of a well-trained warrior. Then watch yourself, and throw not caution to the wind.


--- Athena Has Weapon 05 ---
Athena: The Rail of Adamant, itself, has found its way into your hands, Cousin? A malignant thing, if you were to ask me, and not one I would ever use, myself. Unless, perhaps, I had no other choice. I suppose it must have been that way for you.


--- Athena Low Health 01 ---
Athena: You're badly injured aren't you, Cousin? I wish that I could will the pain away, though at the least I can provide you this.


--- Athena Low Health 02 ---
Athena: Look at you, Zagreus, you're barely fit to fight from all the injury that you've sustained! I'll try to keep you going for as long as possible.


--- Athena Low Health 03 ---
Athena: It seems to me that you've sustained life-draining injuries already, Zagreus. But don't lose hope. We can sustain you in a proper fighting shape.


--- Athena Low Health 04 ---
Athena: You may have suffered many wounds but shall not perish imminently, Cousin. Not if I have anything to say about it. Here.


--- Athena Low Health 05 ---
Athena: Oh, Zagreus... your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped. Nevertheless, always strive onward, while you still draw breath.


--- Athena First Pick Up ---
Zagreus: It's got to be her. Then, here goes nothing... *Ahem*. In the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.
Athena: Hail, noble Cousin. Now, let's get you from that miserable place. I'll see that all of us upon Olympus do our part, beginning here with me.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 01 ---
Athena: Keep fighting, Cousin. Fight from out of that eternal gloom. I trust that you'll be joining us upon Olympus shortly.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 02 ---
Athena: I have your back, Cousin. Rise now to your rightful station with my blessings!


--- Athena Misc Pickup 03 ---
Athena: May the light and fury of Olympus guide you from the dark, Cousin. I've a token of it for you here.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 04 ---
Athena: Push forward, noble Cousin. I shall be keen to see you circumvent the perils that the Fates arranged for you this time.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 05 ---
Athena: Vanquish all who stand against you, noble Cousin. I and your relatives upon Olympus shall assist you in so doing.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 06 ---
Athena: Sometimes I think about what you've endured, to have been living in that loathsome squalor, Cousin. I swear, you'll have your justice.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 07 ---
Athena: Do not fear your father's cruel legions, Cousin! Their lives are long since forfeit, and they cannot stand against one of your birthright, nor against my power.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 08 ---
Athena: Yours is a brazen plan of action, Zagreus, and I admire it. The boldest strategy often prevails. Especially with my support.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 09 ---
Athena: Take heart, Cousin; for you have found me even in the suffocating darkness of the Underworld. May my power be of some assistance.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 10 ---
Athena: Your struggles have not gone unnoticed, Cousin, so take heart. Eternity awaits you once you finally break free.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 11 ---
Athena: Here on Olympus is the opposite of everything about that lifeless squalor you reside in, Zagreus. Fight on and come to us!


--- Athena Misc Pickup 12 ---
Athena: Cousin, I grow angry merely thinking of your situation. May what power I can offer be of service as you struggle towards your fate.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 13 ---
Athena: Your father chose to sever ties with all of us, and stew alone within his land beneath the earth. But you are not beholden to his actions. Fight!


--- Athena Misc Pickup 14 ---
Athena: Your labors make you stronger, noble Cousin. And, the blessings I now offer ought to make you stronger still.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 15 ---
Athena: I've found you once again, dear Cousin, and my strength is yours; so much of it as I can send there to the bowels of the earth.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 16 ---
Athena: I'm here again to lend to you my power, noble Cousin. Though your own strength of will is how you'll finally break free of that cruel place.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 17 ---
Athena: I'm pleased to see your father's stubbornness is manifest in you as such determination, Zagreus. My blessing be with you.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 18 ---
Athena: What wretched fools dare stand against you, Cousin? Punish them, so that they learn something they ought have learned in life.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 19 ---
Athena: Hold fast to your resolve, Cousin, and climb on toward the surface. No matter how often your foothold falters, I am here.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 20 ---
Athena: I shall not keep you, Zagreus, except to offer you some of my power to improve your chances of escape. Now quickly choose, and go.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 19 B ---
Athena: May wisdom and good fortune guide you toward the light of day this time, Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 20 B ---
Athena: The Underworld's wretched dead shall fear you yet, Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 21 ---
Athena: Strength and wisdom guide you from the darkness, Zagreus.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 22 ---
Athena: The low cunning of your lifeless enemies is not a match for your divine might.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 23 ---
Athena: Remember I am always watching over you, dear Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 24 ---
Athena: You'll have your justice in due course, Cousin. I promise you.


--- Athena Misc Pickup 25 ---
Athena: The might and fury of Olympus courses through you, noble Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 01 ---
Athena: I take it you've a plan in mind this time for how you're going to escape, don't you, Cousin?


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 02 ---
Athena: I shall not keep you, Zagreus, except to offer you my power to improve your chances of escape.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 03 ---
Athena: Remain relentless in your effort, Zagreus. For perseverance is a quality we all possess.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 04 ---
Athena: I and your family on Olympus all stand ready to support you in your efforts, noble Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 05 ---
Athena: Remember, doubt and hesitancy are your real enemies, Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 06 ---
Athena: I know that you are more than capable even without my power, Cousin. But just in case...


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 07 ---
Athena: Envision your success, and choose the means by which you shall achieve it, Zagreus.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 08 ---
Athena: I shall not offer empty words, dear Cousin; I shall instead offer you this.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 09 ---
Athena: With our ferocity combined, Cousin, what chances do your father's forces even have?


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 10 ---
Athena: My support alone is not enough to see you through this, Zagreus; but it certainly shall help.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 11 ---
Athena: Your foes shall soon find it impossible to overcome your strength, combined with mine.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 12 ---
Athena: I've every confidence that you shall imminently put my blessing to good use.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 13 ---
Athena: Let not your sense of purpose waver, Zagreus. Visualize the outcome you desire.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 14 ---
Athena: Make not the same mistake twice, and you shall always grow wiser, no matter what else.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 15 ---
Athena: I shall do everything within my power to defend you from the perils of your journey, Zagreus.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 16 ---
Athena: Take heed against your father's legions, Zagreus. And take also my power.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 17 ---
Athena: Do not forget that changing strategy can be the key to victory, Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 18 ---
Athena: I cannot glean the details of your predicament right now, Cousin. Though maybe this shall help.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Extra 19 ---
Athena: The might and honor of Olympus shield you against the darkness and the dead, Zagreus.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Rare 01 ---
Athena: I take it having an impenetrable defense against your enemies may be of some use, Cousin?


--- Athena Misc Pickup Rare 02 ---
Athena: I'm not in any mood to trifle with your father's nonsense this time, Zagreus. So, use this.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Rare 03 ---
Athena: These are among the mightest defenses I can offer, Zagreus. Choose wisely, then.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Rare 04 ---
Athena: I've readied several of my most potent blessings so your victory can be achieved, Cousin.


--- Athena Misc Pickup Rare 05 ---
Athena: Observe, dear Cousin, for this time I offer you uncommonly superior protection.


--- Athena Loot Bought 01 ---
Athena: It feels unseemly to make contact from that most-unpleasant boatman's stash of ill-gotten wares. Nonetheless, this was an opportunity.


--- Athena Loot Bought 02 ---
Athena: You're difficult to track there in the depths, Cousin; though, the boatman Charon thankfully is proving of some help.


--- Athena Loot Bought 03 ---
Athena: The river-boatman Charon is beholden to your father's realm, but seems agreeable enough, for a fair price.


--- Athena Loot Bought 04 ---
Athena: A shrewd expenditure of wealth is sometimes all that stands between a victory and sore defeat, isn't that right, Cousin?


--- Athena Loot Bought 05 ---
Athena: We cannot effectively communicate with Charon from Olympus, but he is amenable to certain trades, and seems unfettered by your father's influence.


--- Athena Rejection 01 ---
Athena: I thought we were on better terms, Cousin. I ask only for your cooperation, yet still you turn your back...?


--- Athena Rejection 02 ---
Athena: I'm disappointed you would spurn me like this, Cousin. Know that I retaliate not out of spite, but by necessity.


--- Athena Rejection 03 ---
Athena: You'd choose one of my relatives, instead of me...? Though I myself was first to contact you? Alas, I must respond to you in kind.


--- Athena Rejection 04 ---
Athena: Upon Olympus, I'm your closest confidant. You'd best remember this before you spurn me again.


--- Athena Rejection 05 ---
Athena: We Olympians, we are a prideful family, Cousin. You cannot simply choose a favorite without spurring one of us to wrath.


--- Athena Rejection 06 ---
Athena: I understand you've made your choice, Cousin. And I, in turn, now have my family's reputation to uphold.


--- Athena Rejection 07 ---
Athena: If you had given due consideration to this matter, then I doubt you would have chosen this outcome.


--- Athena Rejection 08 ---
Athena: No one in our family can avoid taking sides forever, Zagreus. But you can take the more sensible side, at least.


--- Athena Rejection 09 ---
Athena: A senseless, punishable choice. But if you wish to face the consequences, so be it.


--- Athena Rejection 10 ---
Athena: You could have avoided this outcome any number of ways, yet still you risk incurring my wrath.


--- Athena Rejection 11 ---
Athena: Are you testing the limits of my patience with you, Zagreus? Then, I shall test your limits, in turn.


--- Athena Rejection 12 ---
Athena: I knew there was a possibility that you would side against me once again, but your doing so never ceases to amaze, Cousin.


--- Athena Rejection 13 ---
Athena: If this is your idea of humor, Zagreus, then I shall make it clear to you again that I am unamused.


--- Athena Rejection 14 ---
Athena: I think we understand by now that when you test my patience, I shall test your ability to survive.


--- Athena Make Up 01 ---
Athena: *Oh*, let's continue on, already, Zagreus. There isn't any point in feuding, and there's much to do before your quest is done.


--- Athena Make Up 02 ---
Athena: Now then! I hope we can move past this little incident, and keep our focus on the task at hand.


--- Athena Make Up 03 ---
Athena: I'm satisfied we understand each other better, now, don't we. What do you say we carry on, and get you from this place?


--- Athena Make Up 04 ---
Athena: All is forgiven, Zagreus, and I take no offense. Exacting vengeance is just something we Olympians all do from time to time.


--- Athena Make Up 05 ---
Athena: I'd say I've bickered with you quite enough for now, Cousin. Let us continue down a more productive path.


--- Athena Make Up 06 ---
Athena: We've better things to do, I think, than fight amongst ourselves over a matter such as this.


--- Athena Make Up 07 ---
Athena: I would very much prefer to think we both know better than to let old grudges stew forever, Zagreus.


--- Athena Make Up 08 ---
Athena: You see I have my father's temper, Zagreus. I am able to keep it in check, though I expect you to do your part.


--- Athena Make Up 09 ---
Athena: Conflict between the members of our family is inevitable, Zagreus. All we can do is learn and grow from it.


--- Athena Make Up 10 ---
Athena: I see no benefit to staying angry, Cousin. I promised Nyx that I would help rather than hinder you.


--- Athena Make Up 11 ---
Athena: Your father also made some questionable choices, Zagreus. But all of us are family, after all.


--- Athena Gift 01 ---
Zagreus: I'm indebted to you, Goddess, for all that you and your side of the family have done for me.
Athena: Well it simply isn't in my nature to allow such offerings to go unanswered, noble Cousin. In turn, I wish for you to have this, with my compliments.


--- Athena Gift 02 ---
Zagreus: For you, Lady Athena, without whom I would assuredly be lost.
Athena: This is an unexpected gesture, Cousin! I do appreciate it, though please do not feel obliged. I offer you my friendship, not a loan to be repaid.


--- Athena Gift 03 ---
Zagreus: I have a simple token for you, Goddess. Although it's insufficient thanks for all the aid you've given me.
Athena: You are most gracious, Cousin, to extend this offering. You honor me, yet I would ask you think of your well-being for the time, not mine.


--- Athena Gift 04 ---
Zagreus: Goddess Athena, please accept this gift. Your wisdom ever guides me toward the light.
Athena: My, how very generous of you, to offer me this gift! I'm very grateful, though I ask that you not go out of your way on my account. Let's please stay focused, here?


--- Athena Gift 05 A ---
Zagreus: As I remain committed to my task, Goddess, I'm reminded none of this would have been possible without your aid. And so, I must give thanks, even if through a meager offering.
Athena: I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus. But I would ask that you save it for when your task is complete. You've more important matters to attend to now!


--- Athena Gift 05 B ---
Zagreus: As I remain committed to my task, Goddess, I'm reminded none of this would have been possible without your aid. And so, I must give thanks, even if through a meager offering.
Athena: I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus. But I would ask that you save it for a better time. You've more important matters to attend to, now!


--- Athena Gift 06 ---
Zagreus: Lady Athena, I know there's more at stake for you in this than just my plight... you care so much about this family. That care and your determination spurs me on. I'm ever grateful.
Athena: Perhaps there really is no time quite like the present when it comes to showing thanks to one another, my dear Cousin. You've opened my eyes to the possibility, though I remain steadfast in my resolve to fight for you.


--- Athena Gift 07 ---
Zagreus: I know this Ambrosia originated on Olympus, Lady Athena. Though through its long voyage to these depths, I trust its savor is more worthy of your grace. No one's ever had a greater cousin. And I'll never forget what you've done for me.
Athena: Zagreus? When Nyx revealed herself to me and I first learned of you, I saw it as an opportunity to bridge the great divide between Olympus and your father's realm. But, having had all these glimpses into who you are, it is an even greater honor to have forged this partnership with you.


--- Poseidon With Athena 01 ---
Poseidon: As you can see by now, we are a big and clever family, little Hades! My niece Athena here being the cleverest of all. You'd never know that she was childless, the way she looks after and cares for all of us!
Athena: Surely my cleverness comes from your brother and yourself, Lord Uncle Poseidon. And I would only add, my feeling is we've more than enough children in this family, thus no further need for more of them, for now.


--- Demeter With Athena 01 ---
Demeter: To think, young sprout, our strategist Athena, warrior-goddess, sprang from Zeus' head! I would expect that no high intellect could come from there.
Athena: Please do not mind the Lady Demeter's good-natured sense of humor, Zagreus. She and my father often like to jest with one another, even in the most difficult times.
