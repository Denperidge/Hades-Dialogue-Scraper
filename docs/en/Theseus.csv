TheseusExtremeMeasures01|Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah, hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, it's finally time, Asterius. He's here! Aren't you, now, you vile, insignificant hellspawn? Prepare now to be overrun!!
TheseusExtremeMeasures01|Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Zagreus|Oh, this is unfair... that's a bronze-plated Macedonian Tau-Lambda! What's an obnoxious bellyacher like you doing with the most durable chariot created, to date?
TheseusExtremeMeasures01|Theseus Extreme Measures 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Pah{#PreviousFormat}! You don't deserve to know. Suffice it that Asterius and I were handsomely rewarded once again. And we shall not hesitate to exploit our hard-fought spoils against {#DialogueItalicFormat}you{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds02|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 02|Theseus|He would pit you against me, Asterius. I can see it in his mis-matched eyes! I cannot shake the terrible vision that, someday or night, it shall be me, standing alone here, whilst you...? Whilst you take sides against me! With that {#DialogueItalicFormat}fiend{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds02|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 02|Zagreus|Asterius, about that, please consider it a standing offer, if you like. I'd rather have you as a friend than as a foe. Not sure that I can say the same for Theseus, of course.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds02|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 02|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}You poisonous worm{#PreviousFormat}! I knew you had a more sinister trick at play, because your fighting style certainly is of no concern just on its own! Are there truly no depths to which you would not stoop?!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 03|Theseus|...I'm telling you, you're {#DialogueItalicFormat}wrong{#PreviousFormat}, Asterius! He is no {#DialogueItalicFormat}royalty{#PreviousFormat}, most certainly not any {#DialogueItalicFormat}I {#PreviousFormat}would recognize! He's but a nameless, long-forgotten minor god born of the depths, and bound to stay in them!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 03|Minotaur|I, too, once was berated by such words, king. We've faced this enemy how many times? And in my estimation, he's fought bravely, here.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds03_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 03|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Bravely{#PreviousFormat}?! Hiding behind those pillars is what you call {#DialogueItalicFormat}bravely{#PreviousFormat}, Asterius? We shall have to discuss this strange lapse of judgment after we achieve our victory!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 04|Theseus|I hope you're perfectly pleased with yourself, hellspawn. Because Asterius has been quite cross with me! Such as he is. He says I have misjudged the likes of you! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Outrageousness{#PreviousFormat}.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 04|Minotaur|You don't hear me, king. We still have a lot to learn about this foe. Each time, he's differently equipped. Weapons, god-given abilities, and such. Despite our efforts... it's been difficult to read his strategies.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds04_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 04|Theseus|And now, you're saying I can't fight, Asterius? Even though I had no difficulty besting {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}within that maze of yours?! Come on, let's do this fight!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 05|Theseus|Well, worm! Come fight us, I suppose. And take fullest advantage of the havoc that you sowed! We are no team! We're merely two combatants, simultaneously booked to be here, now.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 05|Minotaur|King, I think you are over-reacting, here. Try to be reasonable. And be more considerate about my point of view. Don't think I am asking for too much.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds05_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 05|Theseus|You're asking the impossible of me! But, let us fight. And let us lose, I'm sure, because if we are not a team, what are we, then, Asterius...?
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 06|Theseus|Please fight with me, again, Asterius. I mean, just like before! You must forgive me my indecencies of late. This blasted fiend! His lies and treachery get right under my skin. Or the phantasmagorical equivalent!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 06|Minotaur|Swear something to me, king. That you'll discard your fears about our bond. The short one here is never going to break it. He doesn't even understand it. The only one who can break it is you, yourself.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds06_A|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds A 06|Theseus|I... oh, my dear friend, Asterius. I see, of course, you're right, you're right. {#DialogueItalicFormat}You're right{#PreviousFormat}! And I solemnly do swear to you, indeed, that I shall never again doubt our brotherhood! Nor shall I ever listen to this fiend! Together, now and always!!
TheseusExtremeMeasures02|Theseus Extreme Measures 02|Theseus|Come forth, blackguard, and you shall soon be crushed under the massive wheels of the finest chariot the world has ever known!
TheseusExtremeMeasures02|Theseus Extreme Measures 02|Zagreus|You only have that chariot because of me, you know. It's all because of a condition of the Pact of Punishment! Nothing you did or earned. So drop the act!
TheseusExtremeMeasures02|Theseus Extreme Measures 02|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Hahahahah{#PreviousFormat}, what?! You claim to be my benefactor, when in truth, you are my figuratively mortal enemy?! I'll do the chariot-equivalent of trample you!
TheseusExtremeMeasures03|Theseus Extreme Measures 03|Theseus|Come, blackguard! And be crushed beneath the raging wheelwork of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda, once again!
TheseusExtremeMeasures03|Theseus Extreme Measures 03|Zagreus|Theseus, you do know you look even more ridiculous than normal wearing that mask? I get the chariot and the unsporting weaponry, but why wear {#DialogueItalicFormat}that {#PreviousFormat}thing?
TheseusExtremeMeasures03|Theseus Extreme Measures 03|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Bah! {#PreviousFormat}This blessed mask was crafted by great Daedalus, himself! A work of art, and my entitled claim as champion! What has he ever done for you?!
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Theseus|Well now, Asterius, he's returned! And this time, we shall have to vanquish him without the aid of our divine armor! A worthy challenge, no?
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Minotaur|Be cautious not to underestimate him, king. He has proved troublesome before.
TheseusPactReverted01|Theseus Pact Reverted 01|Theseus|Nonsense, my friend! For how can one underestimate that which deserves no esteem whatsoever?! Together, now, {#DialogueItalicFormat}attack{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon01|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 01|Theseus|Well, you senseless monster, I suspect you're not so pleased with yourself, now! Behold!! For my glorious chariot has been restored!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon01|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 01|Zagreus|Oh, indeed, nice work! Though must have cost a fortune in gemstones and diamonds, restoring an old Macedonian. I thought it was totaled after last time.
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon01|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 01|Theseus|The only thing which shall be totaled here, you heartless property-destroying scourge, is {#DialogueItalicFormat}you yourself{#PreviousFormat}! Asterius!! Together, let us break him!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon02|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 02|Theseus|My chariot and I stand ready for you, daemon! And I assume Asterius, as well! I feel it in my phantom heart, we shall not fall to you this time!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon02|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 02|Zagreus|You know, my opinion of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda has fallen precipitously of late. Though perhaps it's not the chariot but the driver.
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon02|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 02|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Silence{#PreviousFormat}!! Show me a finer chariot-driver anywhere within Elysium, why, you cannot! I'll run you down for such an insult to my pride!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon03|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 03|Theseus|Ready yourself and your fine armor, friend Asterius! I shall drive circles around him, whilst you dispatch him with your mighty axe!
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon03|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 03|Zagreus|Your strategy might work a little better if you didn't shout it loud enough for me to hear. Though I have to say I'm impressed you can drive, fight, and shout all at the same time.
TheseusExtremeMeasures_IfYouWon03|Theseus Extreme Measures If You Won 03|Theseus|And {#DialogueItalicFormat}I{#PreviousFormat}, fiend, am impressed that {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}yet live and breathe! A temporary state Asterius and I shall soon alleviate! {#DialogueItalicFormat}To war{#PreviousFormat}!!
TheseusWithAsterius01|Theseus With Asterius 01|Minotaur|He's here, king. Activating armor. It's fortunate repairs on your chariot were completed in time.
TheseusWithAsterius01|Theseus With Asterius 01|Theseus|Nonsense, my friend! We could defeat this vile hellspawn with or without the additional divine protection we've been granted here! Get him!
TheseusPoseidonQuestReaction01|Theseus Poseidon Quest Reaction 01|Theseus|Avert your eyes, fiend, lest the shining bronzework of the Macedonian should strike you blind! We are prepared to face your devilry!
TheseusPoseidonQuestReaction01|Theseus Poseidon Quest Reaction 01|Zagreus|Prepared for me, really? I've dismantled your ridiculous chariot before. Even Poseidon knows you're just a blowhard with a fancy ride.
TheseusPoseidonQuestReaction01|Theseus Poseidon Quest Reaction 01|Theseus|How {#DialogueItalicFormat}dare {#PreviousFormat}you to invoke my Lord Poseidon's name?! And, to besmirch our complicated past! No god shall ever favor you as he has favored both Asterius and me!
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Theseus|Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Minotaur|Two against one. Seems hardly fair.... Ah, well! {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}Let's kill him and be done, king.
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Zagreus|Theseus?! The Bull of Minos?! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!
TheseusFirstAppearance_NotMetMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Not Met Minotaur|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ahh{#PreviousFormat}, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Minotaur|I warned you, short one. Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only other foe whom I have ever faced, who bested me.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Theseus|Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Zagreus|Theseus?! No way! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Beat Minotaur|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ahh{#PreviousFormat}, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Minotaur|Beware, short one. Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only foe whom I have ever faced, who bested me.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Theseus|Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Zagreus|Theseus?! No way! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!
TheseusFirstAppearance_MetNotBeatMinotaur|Theseus First Appearance Met Not Beat Minotaur|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ahh{#PreviousFormat}, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouLost|Theseus Second Encounter If You Lost 01|Theseus|So! The fiend returns to challenge us again, Asterius! Despite having experienced such a thorough thrashing by us last time!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouLost|Theseus Second Encounter If You Lost 01|Zagreus|You know full well that wasn't a fair fight. Face me yourself and we'll see how you fare.
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouLost|Theseus Second Encounter If You Lost 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Silence{#PreviousFormat}, you monster! I'll hear no more such wicked lies, half-truths, or quarter-truths! You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouWon|Theseus Second Encounter If You Won 01|Theseus|So! The fiend returns to challenge us again, Asterius! Or, rather, to besmirch the honor of this competition!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouWon|Theseus Second Encounter If You Won 01|Zagreus|Besmirch {#DialogueItalicFormat}what {#PreviousFormat}honor? You're just complaining that you lost. Even though I was outnumbered!
TheseusSecondEncounter01_IfYouWon|Theseus Second Encounter If You Won 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Silence{#PreviousFormat}, you monster!! I'll hear no more such wicked lies, half-truths, or quarter-truths! You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Theseus|What are those bestial gloves of yours, blackguard? Beginning to show more of your true and savage nature, here perhaps?
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Minotaur|No. He bears the Twin Fists in the aspect of a king called Gilgamesh. That king, he, too, wrestled a beastlike man, who then became a friend. Maybe that's why I knew this fight would come.
TheseusAboutGilgameshAspect01|Theseus About Gilgamesh Aspect 01|Theseus|What are you telling me, Asterius? Now is certainly not a good time for waxing philosophical, I think! And, surely this King Gilgamesh of whom you speak is much more competent a fighter than {#DialogueItalicFormat}this {#PreviousFormat}filth!
TheseusEncounter01|Theseus Encounter 01|Theseus|So, hellspawn! You seek to break through to the surface of the world. But you shall not achieve your goal, whilst I yet live and breathe! Or the equivalent of it, here in the splendors of Elysium!
TheseusEncounter01|Theseus Encounter 01|Zagreus|Then you leave me with little choice but to make you shut up, already. And your bull-headed manservant there.
TheseusEncounter01|Theseus Encounter 01|Theseus|That {#DialogueItalicFormat}Minotaur {#PreviousFormat}whom you address is my dear friend, you preconceiving stain upon the earth! Asterius and I are brothers here in death as we were enemies in life. Not that you could ever understand fraternal bonds as strong as ours!
TheseusEncounter02|Theseus Encounter 02|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah-hah{#PreviousFormat}, the fiend comes crawling back once more, drawn as he is much like the unassuming moth unto the flame of righteousness!
TheseusEncounter02|Theseus Encounter 02|Zagreus|Oh no! Not the flame of righteousness! Are you finished? Let's get this started, I've come a long way.
TheseusEncounter02|Theseus Encounter 02|Theseus|Hear that, Asterius? Our fiendish visitor is begging us for mercy. Begging us, no doubt, to drop our guard!! Together now, my friend, let's vanquish him, and may the glory of Olympus guide us!!
TheseusEncounter03|Theseus Encounter 03|Theseus|And where do you think you're going, fiend?! Thought you might scoot right past Asterius and myself without a fight?
TheseusEncounter03|Theseus Encounter 03|Zagreus|No, on quite the contrary I've been under no impression that avoiding conflict is an option here. So say your piece, and let's get on with it.
TheseusEncounter03|Theseus Encounter 03|Theseus|You, hellspawn, shall not traverse that gate behind me whilst my compatriot and I equivalently live and breathe! Prepare for death!
TheseusEncounter04|Theseus Encounter 04|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah, hahaha, {#PreviousFormat}you are just in time, Fiend from Lowest Depths! Asterius and I have trained extensively since our last skirmish here!
TheseusEncounter04|Theseus Encounter 04|Zagreus|So all you do here in Elysium is train for martial competition? You're constantly awaiting your next fight to the death?
TheseusEncounter04|Theseus Encounter 04|Theseus|And who are {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}to judge, you misbegotten, shameful, unfilial maggot? It is an {#DialogueItalicFormat}honor {#PreviousFormat}to have the opportunity to spend my afterlife perpetually standing in your ruinous path!
TheseusEncounter05|Theseus Encounter 05|Theseus|See here, Asterius! The god-hated fiend is back once more to be destroyed by our joint, righteous fury!
TheseusEncounter05|Theseus Encounter 05|Zagreus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}God-hated{#PreviousFormat}? You'll have to be more specific. I have the gods on my side. Though I suppose you do, too. Why can't they make up their minds?
TheseusEncounter05|Theseus Encounter 05|Theseus|They {#DialogueItalicFormat}have {#PreviousFormat}made up their minds! They stand united against darkness, as do I! With the exception of Asterius, here, who serves the light! Let's serve it now, my friend! To battle!
TheseusWinStreak01|Theseus Win Streak 01|Theseus|Upon my word, the fiend again darkens these halls! Alas, Asterius, it seems I was mistaken and he hasn't learned his lesson after all!
TheseusWinStreak01|Theseus Win Streak 01|Zagreus|And what's this lesson that I ought have learned? Is it to always slay you first since you're so damn insufferable all the time?
TheseusWinStreak01|Theseus Win Streak 01|Theseus|Your lesson, monster, is to never, {#DialogueItalicFormat}ever {#PreviousFormat}take up arms against those favored by the gods themselves! You shall never see the light of day as I once did! Uh, no offense, Asterius.
TheseusLoseStreak01|Theseus Lose Streak 01|Theseus|Well, hellspawn, you stained my honor last we battled here. But as you plainly see, I have returned! As has Asterius! And we've no shortage of honor left to spare!
TheseusLoseStreak01|Theseus Lose Streak 01|Zagreus|Shouldn't {#DialogueItalicFormat}I {#PreviousFormat} be the Champion of Elysium, now that I've beaten you? Isn't there someone else around to challenge me, say, Heracles? Someone less chatty?
TheseusLoseStreak01|Theseus Lose Streak 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah, hahaha, {#PreviousFormat}very clever, fiend. Invoking Heracles' name, in an attempt to drive me to a jealous rage. It shall not work! But you shall dearly pay nevertheless!
TheseusLoseStreak02A|Theseus Lose Streak A 02|Theseus|The monster has returned, in a vainglorious attempt to wrest the title Champion from me!
TheseusLoseStreak02A|Theseus Lose Streak A 02|Zagreus|I couldn't care less about your title. Though, shouldn't you share it with the Minotaur? He's more than half the reason you've been any trouble.
TheseusLoseStreak02A|Theseus Lose Streak A 02|Theseus|You'll not drive a wedge between us, fiend. Asterius and I share a fraternal bond forged from the strongest bronze! Nay, adamant! But you have caused us both offense, so, die!
TheseusLoseStreak02|Theseus Lose Streak 02|Theseus|I have recovered, as you can plainly see, monster! As has Asterius! And this time we are filled with renewed vigor, to destroy you utterly!
TheseusLoseStreak02|Theseus Lose Streak 02|Zagreus|So we're locked in an endless cycle of violence, basically. I guess that's one way for you to pass the time here in this stodgy place.
TheseusLoseStreak02|Theseus Lose Streak 02|Theseus|You take that back about Elysium! Or, better: I shall make you eat those careless, inappropriate remarks! Come, Asterius, {#DialogueItalicFormat}to war{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusWithAsterius02|Theseus With Asterius 02|Minotaur|We're well-equipped to deal with you, short one. Though I know better than to disregard your might.
TheseusWithAsterius02|Theseus With Asterius 02|Theseus|Speak for yourself, Asterius! I, for one, know only pure contempt for this foul daemon and his underhanded fighting style! A style we shall easily dismantle, now!
TheseusWithAsterius03|Theseus With Asterius 03|Theseus|What hope have you, monster, versus the blessed bonds of brotherhood?
TheseusWithAsterius03|Theseus With Asterius 03|Minotaur|Best not belittle him, king. He is more powerful than he appears. We must remain alert, this time.
TheseusWithAsterius03|Theseus With Asterius 03|Theseus|Oh, I am perfectly alert right now, Asterius! And were I still alive, I would be positively salivating at the thought of running through this pustule with my spear, or whichever means I had available! Now, {#DialogueItalicFormat}let's go{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusWithAsterius04|Theseus With Asterius 04|Zagreus|Theseus, before you flap your ghostly gums at me again, I'd like to hear from good Asterius this time! He almost never gets a word in, thanks to you.
TheseusWithAsterius04|Theseus With Asterius 04|Minotaur|The king speaks for the both of us, short one. Though if you wish to hear me say something to you, I will oblige.
TheseusWithAsterius04|Theseus With Asterius 04|Theseus|And I, too, shall oblige! That is, oblige my trusty spear, which yearns to penetrate your soft and vulnerable, altogether pallid flesh! Now, die!
TheseusPostEnding01|Theseus Post Ending 01|Theseus|Why, look, Asterius, the fiend returns! The rumors that he fled to haunt the surface must have been mere lies!
TheseusPostEnding01|Theseus Post Ending 01|Zagreus|Well no, in this case, those rumors must have been quite accurate, it's just, I'm back! Realized I didn't want a future for myself that didn't include crushing you repeatedly like this.
TheseusPostEnding01|Theseus Post Ending 01|Theseus|Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hoho{#PreviousFormat}, such {#DialogueItalicFormat}clever {#PreviousFormat}excuse-making from one so versed in treachery! Well, if you are indeed contained within this realm, then we shall be delighted to make sure it always stays that way! Now come and fight!
TheseusPostEpilogue01|Theseus Post Epilogue 01|Theseus|Have you yet heard, monster?! The Queen Persephone is back! To rule the Underworld in all her terrifying grace! Perhaps one of these days or nights she shall be present in the stands, to witness your destruction at our hands!
TheseusPostEpilogue01|Theseus Post Epilogue 01|Zagreus|Yeah, about that? She's my mother. So maybe watch your fool mouth with me, or else I might just put in a bad word!
TheseusPostEpilogue01|Theseus Post Epilogue 01|Theseus|Oh, you disgust me, daemon, that you would even dare to say such things about the Queen! Prepare now to be {#DialogueItalicFormat}vanquished {#PreviousFormat}in her name!
TheseusLowHealth01|Theseus Low Health 01|Theseus|What's this, Asterius? This blackguard thinks that he can saunter in here whilst bleeding profusely, and confront the two of us?! A hollow fool!
TheseusLowHealth01|Theseus Low Health 01|Zagreus|Ran into trouble on the way with your combative friends here in Elysium. One more unfair advantage in your favor.
TheseusLowHealth01|Theseus Low Health 01|Theseus|How would you know of fairness, fiend? You belong in the lowest depths, forgotten in the mists of time! Come, let us send you there!
TheseusLowHealth02|Theseus Low Health 02|Theseus|Look at this contemptible fiend, stumbling half-dead already into our hallowed colosseum! What transpired, monster, did perchance my Exalted brethren trouble your dark path?
TheseusLowHealth02|Theseus Low Health 02|Zagreus|Theseus? I would appreciate it if you could be more considerate of the substantial effort necessary just to reach this point where I can make you shut your mouth.
TheseusLowHealth02|Theseus Low Health 02|Theseus|Effort, {#DialogueItalicFormat}pah{#PreviousFormat}! You shall be imminently slain, and {#DialogueItalicFormat}effortlessly{#PreviousFormat}, I am quite certain of that! Asterius, to arms!!
TheseusLowHealth03|Theseus Low Health 03|Theseus|What hope can you possibly have of vanquishing us, hellspawn, when you are visibly upon the verge of death? You are, more than usual, a miserable sight!
TheseusLowHealth03|Theseus Low Health 03|Zagreus|Thanks for your concern, there, Theseus. But I trust I have plenty of life left in me with which to destroy you, if not your companion as well.
TheseusLowHealth03|Theseus Low Health 03|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Hah! {#PreviousFormat}What would you know of trust! Being a vile, grievously-wounded-already creature such as you are! Asterius, let's end his misery!
TheseusYarnReaction01|Theseus Yarn Reaction 01|Theseus|What's this? Our enemy has come to mock us, Asterius! He holds the Yarn of Ariadne, and would flaunt it in our faces!
TheseusYarnReaction01|Theseus Yarn Reaction 01|Zagreus|What, this? I just picked it out of a Well. Was supposed to help me get here. No offense intended, more than usual. What's it to you?
TheseusYarnReaction01|Theseus Yarn Reaction 01|Theseus|As if you wouldn't know! That Yarn is a token of days long gone. When Asterius and I battled in the Labyrinth, to the death! Together, we now face a greater threat. Attack us if you dare!
TheseusYarnReaction02|Theseus Yarn Reaction 02|Theseus|Again you mock me with the Yarn of Ariadne, blackguard. You ought know that woman's name means absolutely nothing to me, now!
TheseusYarnReaction02|Theseus Yarn Reaction 02|Zagreus|You seem pretty put off by a random bit of twine, there, Former King of Athens. Care to share your innermost thoughts on the subject, or best keep them bottled up?
TheseusYarnReaction02|Theseus Yarn Reaction 02|Theseus|Nothing shall be bottled {#DialogueItalicFormat}here{#PreviousFormat}, you filth! That she became enamored of me was not my responsibility, besides! She was naive! The same as you.
TheseusYarnReaction03|Theseus Yarn Reaction 03|Theseus|That blasted Yarn of Ariadne, once again!! Have you no shred of dignity at all, monster? Or would you stoop to any desperate means to draw me out?
TheseusYarnReaction03|Theseus Yarn Reaction 03|Zagreus|Just happened to have it on me, Theseus. But it seems to keep upsetting you. Maybe you should seek this Ariadne in my father's realm, and make amends?
TheseusYarnReaction03|Theseus Yarn Reaction 03|Theseus|Maybe {#DialogueItalicFormat}you {#PreviousFormat}should {#DialogueItalicFormat}shut up{#PreviousFormat}!! That Ariadne's dead to me. She has been since we were alive! I cherish her memory, yes. But only because, if not for her, I'd not have met Asterius! Now, meet his axe!!
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Theseus|Why, look, Asterius! It seems the fiend has brought some sort of nondescript yarn-ball! Not seen the likes of it. Indeed, it holds no sway on me, at all!
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Minotaur|King. The princess Ariadne was my sister, if you don't recall. Please do not denigrate her memory. {#DialogueItalicFormat}<Snort> {#PreviousFormat}You're making me upset.
TheseusYarnReaction04|Theseus Yarn Reaction 04|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}, no, my friend! I meant you no offense! But I'd no love for her, was that my fault?! {#DialogueItalicFormat}Pff{#PreviousFormat}, forgive me. I... I shall seek her out. Someday or night. But first!! This daemon {#DialogueItalicFormat}has {#PreviousFormat}to be destroyed. Together, no?!
TheseusAutographReaction01|Theseus Autograph Reaction 01|Theseus|Now hold a moment, fiend! Asterius made me aware that you recently asked of him an {#DialogueItalicFormat}autograph{#PreviousFormat}. A tribute to his fame! As I am Champion, I am prepared to generously offer mine, as well.
TheseusAutographReaction01|Theseus Autograph Reaction 01|Zagreus|Oh! No thanks. Appreciate the offer, though. How about a fight, instead?
TheseusAutographReaction01|Theseus Autograph Reaction 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah, pffsch{#PreviousFormat}, you...! 'Twas merely a jest! I'd not have given you the cloth about my loins, much less my name! But a fight you certainly shall have!
TheseusAboutBeingChampion01|Theseus About Being Champion 01|Theseus|Ready yourself, Asterius, my friend! For our most hated enemy has come to challenge us again, before this loving crowd!
TheseusAboutBeingChampion01|Theseus About Being Champion 01|Zagreus|I don't understand this place at all. How is it you're still champion after all this time? After losing repeatedly and often, I mean.
TheseusAboutBeingChampion01|Theseus About Being Champion 01|Theseus|What would you know of it?! There's more, much more, to being champion than empty victories! It is a way of thought. A bearing! A certain dignity which you shall never have!
TheseusAboutGods01|Theseus About Gods 01|Theseus|The gods are testing us once more, Asterius! For, how else to explain this fiend approaching us, bearing such blessings as would normally be fit only for heroes such as we?
TheseusAboutGods01|Theseus About Gods 01|Zagreus|You {#DialogueItalicFormat}do {#PreviousFormat}know I'm related to them, right? The god of the dead is my father? I'm sure word's gotten around. Not that I want deferential treatment from the likes of you.
TheseusAboutGods01|Theseus About Gods 01|Theseus|Good! For you'll get nothing of the sort. The gods are on {#DialogueItalicFormat}my {#PreviousFormat}side, not yours, monster! What business would they have, abetting you?
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds01|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 01|Theseus|Beware, Asterius! The daemon comes! The daemon, who would sever the fraternal bonds we share, if we so much as drop our guard!
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds01|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 01|Zagreus|What? You think I'm here to ruin your friendship? Look, to each his own in that regard, though since you bring it up, I really don't see why Asterius puts up with you.
TheseusAboutFraternalBonds01|Theseus About Fraternal Bonds 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}You see{#PreviousFormat}? Just as I said! Cover your bovine ears, Asterius, for this monstrosity would poison us to get the upper hand!
TheseusAboutManyBattles01|Theseus About Many Battles 01|Theseus|You know, hellspawn, I have been thinking on this for some time, and I've a declaration I must make: I shall hear no more of your silver-tongued lies. You come here, and we fight, and that is all!
TheseusAboutManyBattles01|Theseus About Many Battles 01|Zagreus|What are you even talking about? I barely get a word in edgewise, much less Asterius over there. You know what? Fine. I've had it with you, anyway.
TheseusAboutManyBattles01|Theseus About Many Battles 01|Theseus|And {#DialogueItalicFormat}I{#PreviousFormat}'ve had it with {#DialogueItalicFormat}you{#PreviousFormat}! Now, come, Asterius, let's shut this blackguard up! Or shut him {#DialogueItalicFormat}down{#PreviousFormat}, whichever you prefer.
TheseusAboutManyBattles02|Theseus About Many Battles 02|Theseus|There is but one thing I shall give to you, blackguard. Other than the razor-sharp point of my blessed spear! You are resilient. Time after time, you challenge us! Sometimes I fear I shall develop some sort of grudging respect for you!
TheseusAboutManyBattles02|Theseus About Many Battles 02|Zagreus|I've no such fear, myself, Theseus. Though, I appreciate you noticing. You're quite an inspiration, you know? I wouldn't come all this way to destroy just anyone.
TheseusAboutManyBattles02|Theseus About Many Battles 02|Theseus|To {#DialogueItalicFormat}be {#PreviousFormat}destroyed, you mean! I see you plain, monster. You seek the glory of this fight, before this crowd? You yearn for it! Then, you shall have it! Just as often as you please!
TheseusAboutPainting01|Theseus About Painting 01|Theseus|I vividly recall our every clash against you, daemon. Each victory! And even the defeats. But you? You've not learned anything, have you?
TheseusAboutPainting01|Theseus About Painting 01|Zagreus|It's all right, Theseus. We have a splendid painting of you back at the House, for those moments when I invariably forget you exist. You were quite dashing with long hair, you know!
TheseusAboutPainting01|Theseus About Painting 01|Theseus|So, I am honored even in the lowest pits of hell? And yet, remembered in my carefree youth. Not in the wisdom of my latter days! Well then, remember {#DialogueItalicFormat}this{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusHasWeaponUpgrade01|Theseus Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Theseus|What, {#DialogueItalicFormat}ho{#PreviousFormat}, that is a handsome spear you doubtless claimed deceitfully from some more-worthy bearer than yourself!
TheseusHasWeaponUpgrade01|Theseus Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Zagreus|Oh, this old thing? How nice of you to notice. It once belonged to the hero, Achilles. A little past your time, but maybe you've heard of him? Seeing as he's {#DialogueItalicFormat}much {#PreviousFormat}more famous than you ever were.
TheseusHasWeaponUpgrade01|Theseus Has Weapon Upgrade 01|Theseus|How {#DialogueItalicFormat}dare {#PreviousFormat}you say such things to me! I was the greatest king of Athens in my day! The tales of my exploits with Asterius and many other challenges shall long outlive whatever comes of {#DialogueItalicFormat}you{#PreviousFormat}!
TheseusAboutArthurAspect01|Theseus About Arthur Aspect 01|Theseus|Tell me something, monster: Whence did you steal that kingly blade you're brandishing about? It seems ill-fitting for one such as you.
TheseusAboutArthurAspect01|Theseus About Arthur Aspect 01|Zagreus|Oh, this? I wouldn't say I stole it, so much as naturally wooed the Fates into bestowing it upon me. You could say I'm kind of testing it out.
TheseusAboutArthurAspect01|Theseus About Arthur Aspect 01|Theseus|{#DialogueItalicFormat}Ahh{#PreviousFormat}, well then! I pity whosoever shall lay hands upon that cursed thing, once you are finished with this {#DialogueItalicFormat}testing {#PreviousFormat}of yours. I think that we can make it rather quick!

TheseusMiscStart13|Theseus Misc Start 13|Theseus|We've nothing left to say to one another, hellspawn! Other than: To battle!
TheseusMiscStart14|Theseus Misc Start 14|Theseus|Few others in Elysium are so unwise to take up arms against Asterius and myself!
TheseusMiscStart15|Theseus Misc Start 15|Theseus|You challenge us to battle, hellspawn?! Then, Asterius and I accept!
